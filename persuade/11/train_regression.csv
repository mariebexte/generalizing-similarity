0D29A98FE8FB,"When you need advice about whether you should go with the pink dress or the blue dress, or what kind of dog you should get, you might want to ask multiply people for advice. I believe that it is smarter to ask multiply people because you might not like the answer one gives you, it's good to have a back up plan, and it's good to have multiple options of what to do. Asking multiple people for advice is a great way to weigh out your options and decide what works the best for you.

If you are trying to decide the best way to break up with your boyfriend then you might ask a friend. If that friend says to just go up and say it to his face and not care about what he feels, you might not think that's the nicest way to break up with him. You would want to ask someone else for advice about what to do because may not like the answer to you got. Another friend might say to go up and slowly ease him into it. See when you ask multiple people you can get another opinion if you don't like the first one.

Imagine you need a dress for the dance on Friday. You ask a couple of your friends what dress you should get. They sent you a list of dresses and you decide that you like the navy one. You go to the store and they tell you that they are all sold out of the navy dress. Normally you would be screwed, but then you remember they sent you a whole list. You also liked the pink one so you decide to get that one. When you ask multiple people you can have a back up plan if one doesn't work out.

Say you want to get a dog. You ask all of your friends what the best dog is and why. They come up to you and tell about how well the are with kids, if they bark a lot, if they are hypoallergenic, how big they get, and how playful and cute they are. You look at all your options and decide the best dog for you is the toy poodle. When you ask multiple people you get multiple answers and more options to choose from. If you only asked one person then you wouldn't get all the information about all the dogs you might only get information about one.

In conclusion, I believe that it is important to ask multiple people for advice. You can have multiple ideas for if you don't like one or for if you need a back up plan. It's also important to have multiple ideas for great big decisions. It can never hurt to ask for multiple people for advice, but it can certainly help.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
BEAD93DDDB69,"Have you ever asked someone for his or her advice on a subject, and ended up not liking their answer? Maybe as a result asked someone else instead? Seeking multiple opinions seems to help people make better choices, but why? What makes a choice feel so much safer, and clearer, when it's made by listening to someone else's opinion?

I think that it's easy to overlook, but this question can have a much deeper meaning than you may have first thought.

I know that when I am feeling indecisive, I like to be able to consider as many outcomes or results as possible. Therefore I ask multiple people for insight on my situation. But sometimes I only make it harder on myself by getting answers that are all over the place! Whether it's in regards to something as simple as what flavor coffee to get that day, or what kind of car I should buy! My friends can never seem to agree, and I can never seem to choose on my own.

For example when the walls in my new house were being painted, I asked a few friends of mine what color I should have done. My absolute best friend Generic_Name said, ""I would love it if you got baby blue!"" But when I asked my brother he responded with, ""Just paint them black, doesn't matter anyway."" I know, not a big help. The last person I asked was my co-worker Generic_Name, he said, ""NO! Don't paint them! Walls should be left alone."" What does that even mean? And even though I didn't get any answers that helped me make a decision, I still feel like I couldn't have done it without them!

I did a project on social anxiety in the fifth grade, I hardly even remember what all I actually did. But I do remember that one experiment I performed while studying social anxiety was asking a friend of mine, Generic_Name, what she thought of a t-shirt I had found online, and asking if she would want it. She was excited and said, ""Oh my goodness really? I love that shirt, thank you!"" and gave me a hug before walking away. Later I asked another girl the same question, making sure that Generic_Name could hear the response, but the second girl said the shirt was ugly and that she'd never wear it. Generic_Name later came to me and said she did not want the shirt, and that she had changed her mind. This was just the reaction I had been looking for, and another reason that I believe explains why we ask so eagerly for others opinions is that the question is not of an opinion, but of acceptance.

Why does seeking multiple opinions help us make better choices? I believe this question has many different answers, based off of different opinions, the fear of being rejected for personal opinions. A constant need of approval. Perhaps just simply wanting to be informed of as many possible outcomes thinkable. Maybe your just a girl with walls that need painted, or maybe your a guy that feels he needs to bend to meets others' standards, either way, we ask for advice left and right, seemingly everyday.                                                                                                                                       ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5B11DE2C4232,"When you need advice who do you go to? Your family, your friends,or people on the internet, the best answer is all of them. Asking multiple people is the best way to get advice for something because they might have experience in your position, they might get asked for advice quite often,or they could just know you very well and be intelleget.

The first persons you should ask is your parents because they are older than you and probally have some experience in your position. You should ask them what they would do and how they would do it. They might be able to even give you something that would help you.

The second persons you should ask for advice are your friends becasue they know you well and if they are good friends they will try their hardest to help you. They might have already been is your shoes and made a mistake that they won't let you make. They could also ask there parents to help them help you.

The third persons that you should ask are the thousands of people on the internet becasue out of those thousands there is bound to be a couple of them that have gone through what your going through. There could also be some theripist that could help you. The internet is the best place to ask for any information or advice because the people there are smart or can just look it up.

Over all The people that you can ask for advice is very large. But always ask multiple people before making any decision,so that you can make the best one. Ask them becasue they have experience, they might get asked that question all the tme,or they know you very well.                                               ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
7B8DBB84E77E,"Everyone's needed advice for something multiple times in your life. Some people keep there problem to them self, or ask one person to help give them advice. Although they may only 'trust' that one person, or they may 'trust' no one, seeking advice from multiple people is way more beneficial. If you just keep to yourself or get one source of help, it's never going to really help. How do you think the most famous people in the U.S. got over their problems? They seeked help from multiple peers! Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they have more perspective, they have different ways to overcome the problem, and the person asking for advice gains more support with multiple people.

Some people think keeping there problems to themselves will solve the problem eventually. The truth is, it doesn't. You might think you're the only one in the world who is having problems, but people never realize everyone else is human too. Everyone's been in tough situations, most of the time they're even in the same exact problem. Having more perspective on your situation helps people make a better choice because people solve things differently, so asking one person how they made their choice might not help with your problem, so by asking multiple people you get multiple views on how they solved a problem in your situation.

As I said in the last paragraph, someones advice may not work for a certain situation. Most people think because they're bestfriends, or they're really good friends automatically makes their advice the best. Just because you trust that one person to help you doesn't mean they always have the answer. You need to get multiple opinions from multiple people. Asking multiple people for advice gives you different ways to overcome a problem, this helps you make a better choice because by opening up to multiple people, you get there past experiences and how they solved it, and by getting multiple ways to overcome the problem they can think more about their problem and use someones advice that worked out for that certain problem, or they could even put multiple advice together to solve their problem based on other peoples outcomes.

Of course by asking multiple people for advice gives you different views and different solutions, but by asking multiple people, you get there support. Put it this way. Lets say you're playing a video game and you're facing the final boss. You're not going to beat the boss by yourself. You need troops, or some sort of supporting attack and defense to defeat this boss. Thats exactly how it is when you ask multiple people for advice! You get more feedback, you get more resources, you get more support to overcome your problem! Asking multiple people for advice gives you more support, and this helps people make a better choice because they have more backup to their problem, and with more backup you have more power to overcome you're problem, just like the video game analogy explained.

So, does seeking advice from multiple people help you make a better choice? Yes, it helps you make a better choice because you have more perspective of your problem, asking multiple people gives you different ways to overcome your problem, and you have more support with your problem. Although by asking multiple people there are different reasons it helps you overcome a problem, but getting more perspective stands out more than getting different ways to overcome your problem and having more support. Having more perspective on how other people dealt with their situation really gives you a brief explanation of what will happen if you do what they tell you. It makes you feel stronger, just like the video game. If you try to beat the boss one way, it might not work, but having someone else's way on defeating the boss, that way might work for you. There is a saying ""the more the better"", and that is a perfect quote for when you need advice. Next time you're down in the dumps, or you're having difficulty with something, ask multiple people, I want you to see the effectiveness on having more perspective, more options, and more support.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
2107BAE9CB50,"""What?! That's crazy talk!"" Generic_Name screamed in shock as she walked away from Generic_Name. ""I asked her for advice, It's unbelievable that she would even think I would do that,"" Generic_Name said under her breath while she dialed another one of her friend's number to ask her for advice instead. The friend she called, Generic_Name, picked up the phone and Generic_Name began to ask her for advice. ""I get it, I've been in that same situation before,"" Generic_Name responded. Generic_Name stayed on the phone with Generic_Name fr over an hour giving her advice. After the long phone called filled with meaningful conversations, Generic_Name was satisfied with Generic_Name's advice. It was probably the best advice she had ever heard, ""Thank you so much, Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name said with a smile as she hung up the phone. Asking more than one person for advice is better than only asking one person because, there may be someone who has been in the same situation, the person in need of advice may completely disagree with someone's advice, and better advice will be found with the more people who are asked.

To begin, asking more than one person for advice is better than only asking one person because, there is always someone who has been in the same situation. When someone that shares the same experience is asked for advice, they'll probably give the best advice to someone about the situation. They'll usually know what's best to do since they've been through the same thing. So, people who share that experience are definitely the best ones to ask for advice unless, the person in need of advice isn't satisfied with it. If they're still not satisfied, they can ask more people, which is another reason why it's always smarter to ask more than one person for advice.

Disagreeing with someone's advice is another reason why asking more than one person is smarter. If only one person is asked for advice, it'll seem as if following their advice is the only way to go. For example, if two girls stopped being friends because of a slight misunderstanding and one of the girls asks someone for advice. The advice they're given may be to avoid her, even though they may not like it, they're most likely going to do it. If the girl asks more than one person for advice and the other one says to work the problems out, the girl will have choices and she won't be forced to do something she doesn't want to do.

Another reason why asking more than one person is more effective than only asking one is, better advice will be found with the more people who are asked. If over three people are asked for advice than it'll be less stressful making a choice. Having many options to choose from is way better than only having one choice. As more people are asked, the advice they share may get better and better. Only asking one person limits you to one choice you may not even like. Someone will share the advice they want to hear and making the choice will be easy.

In conclusion, asking more than one person for advice is better than only asking one. Asking more than one person for advice will make it easier to choose good advice to follow. With the more people that are asked for adivce, a good choice will be found. Also, asking more than one person will prevent people from being pressured to do something they don't want to do. Asking more than one person is always best.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
199656C3699E,"How often do you trust your own judgment? Some people trust their own opinion completely, and others not so much. Asking people for advice is such a natural thing to do, that we sometimes dont even realize when we are doing it. Everyone needs guidance, but not everyone wants it. I think seeking other peoples opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see it from another perspective, you receive guidance, and it could help you make a rational decision.

No one is the same, so everyone has a different way of doing things. We all see things a little differently; which is what makes us all unique. If you have a problem or situation, and you cant decide what the best approach would be, you should ask someone else what they would do. They will most likely be glad you asked them, and give you their opinion on the situation. Having a different point of view can sometimes help you see things in a different light. You may change your mind, or decide to stay with your original thought or plan. Either way, it will help you get one step closer to solving your problem.

Humans need guidance to live, because without it we wouldn't know how to do anything on our own. We needed guidance to take our first steps, we needed guidance to ride a bike, we even needed guidance to learn how to put our own shoes on every morning. We would live in a world of chaos if we didn't have the guidance we need from our family, teachers, and friends. Nothing would make since, and we wouldn't be able to function properly. Asking for guidance on what to do is not a bad thing, and we should all do it more often. Sometimes you just don't know what to do; which can cause people to make bad decisions. Asking for help or guidance could potentially help you, even if it does not seen that way at first.

If you are having a problem, and you are stressed out; it can lead you to do things in ways that are more problematic then they are helpful. Everyone's brain processes things in a different way that helps them, although sometimes the things that seem like good ideas in the moment, may only make things worse. Sometimes when we ask someone that is calm, then we can find other ways to deal with the situation in a way that will actually help. It may even give you some time to calm down. One irrational decision or action could ruin everything, so it is important to ask someone else what they would do.

I think seeking for other peoples opinions can help someone make a better choice because you see it from a different perspective, you receive guidance, and it could help you make a rational decision. Of course we all need to learn how to solve things on our own, but no one ever said we couldn't have some help along the way. Even some of the smartest people had to ask for help. No one ever accomplished anything without any advice, so why should we have to?",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
A88A21A1B19E,"Some people love getting advice from others, they like to hear different opinions before they make a real choice on what to do. Lots of people go to different people for multiple reason to find what they are looking for and what is the best decision in them. By talking to others, why people seek more opinions, and how it helps by making a better choice.

By talking to others is a good way of hearing everybody's opinion. By hearing everyone's opinion it lets a know what your choices is if everyone doesn't agree with you or others. Options and seeking opinions is another way to interact with others, and see where there head is at with what information they tell you. The reason its a good idea By chatting with them is because sometimes its hard trying to pick a path or make a hard choice and it stresses you out. Some people out there just have a hard time and like to hear and listen to others on what they thing or what they would choose. With all the stress and hard things in life we as people like to just take a minute and see what others got to say the relief of multiple opinions going and coming to you, and hearing lots of different people say this and that and the option is good and with all going on it will help the person choose a path and make a real choice for themselves in the future.

The reason why people seek for more information, is to hear what everyone has to say in mind about it. This gives that person a opportunity to just sit down and think on what is the best choice for them. Talking with Friends, strangers, and even family seeking lots of information and talking them up is a good way of deciding on whats the best. Today lots kids and grownups have a hard like on deciding, and seeking. With just asking for different opinions is whats going to help you in life. By asking more providing and knowledge will come to you. Life is filled with crazy and wild things that some people just cant control, by sitting down and just talk to someone or even more people and for them telling you your chance of what path to choice will be more advanced. More the opinions the better choice you are positive to make. going to counselor and asking your parents, coworkers or even classmates a better option is in each mind the more you think about the better the opinions will get. The better the choices just by talking to others and seeking make opinions in a good way of coming to make a better choice.

How it helps by making a better choice, with all the opinions you have theres a choice is that. What you say and get back with positive opinions there will always be a positive action in your choice. Opinions by the ones you love the better the choice will be. It will help you to know that there are different opinions that you can came and think on what the right one for you. By seeking advice from positive people your chances is very clever on what choice you make. But not everyone has a positive action in them. With multiple opinions not all will be positive there might be lots of negative energy going throw there head and what you choice on. Right or wrong, Positive or negative actions at the end of the day thats still your decision on what to do, there just giving out there opinion for you. The better and positive the action the better the choice is for you. With all to be said is that asking for more is not bad its a great ways of making a conclusion and thing on what is the best choice for you in life. So why people ask for multiply opinions is to help them make a better life choice with choosing on what they want there path choice to make by others opinions.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
12988594D953,"Getting advice is crucial to success. No matter where you are from or what your future holds, asking for advice stays the same. Advice has many interpretations but to me advice is, asking someone their opinion on how you should do something. This could mean how a person should run a new business or what type of dog food they could buy. One reason I believe advice is so important is because whether you use the advice or not, you still gain knowledge and understanding of that person's point of view. Advice, as important as it is, should not be taken lightly (even for dog food). Taking multiple opinions increases your chance of success because it explores different point of views, eliminates biases and applies different experiences.

Every person has ideals and every persons ideals are different. This is important because with every person's ideals comes a different opinion which effects the advice they give you. Combining the multitude of advice you get with every person you ask will compile a grand list of choices, which is great for you. Now your job is to find the advice that fits you best and execute. Opinions are everything when seeking advice and exploring different views is one of the most solid ways to make the right decision.

Bias is a trait of every human being. When given the choice most people would rather go to their family or a close friend for advice rather than a co-worker they hardly know. Although most people would stick to those that are close to them for advice, I believe going to new people could bode shockingly well. Sticking to biases will lower your range of differentiating ideals, which I mentioned earlier, in turn ending up with similar advice which is not beneficial to someone who really wants the best advice possible. In some cases talking to a loved one is all you need but new people could add a fresh opinion that could change your course of action for the better.

Everyone is different and has had different experiences. These experiences change us and are the very thing that form friendship, ideals and views. That is why I think the most important thing when trying to seek advice is to consider different experiences. Ask different age groups, job titles, ethnicity, religions, races, genders for their advice and they will vary. Through their lives they have seen many things that the others have not, heard about things that the others have not and learned things that the others have not. Differentiating experiences give you new perspectives through the eyes of others. Doing this makes you a smarter person and even if you do not end up using their advice you still gain a new perspective on your issue.

This complied understanding from different ideals, new people and diverse people will give you a great advantage when seeking advice. Once you have this information you must find the advice that best applies to you and you situation. Taking to bias into account make the decision, whether it is life business opportunity or a new brand of dog food, being thorough with advice will always benefit you. Once you have your new advice you have gained more than just an idea on what to do, you have also gained new understanding of the people you have asked and a lot of information that will make a smarter person.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5F584C7A7B66,"Have you ever needed advise on something in your life? You may have had a problem and needed input. Or you may have had to make a decision and needed help on deciding what to do. It helps when you talk to more people about your situation. When you need advise it is best to talk to multiple people because different people have different experiences, different people can help you see the different points of view, and hearing more than one solution can help you understand your situation more.

The first reason it is best to talk to multiple people when you need advise is because different people have different experiences. People tend to look at problems based on the experiences they have gone through and if one person has gone through something similar than they can tell you what they did. For example when someone asked me a difficult question I asked my two of my friends for advise. One of the had never been in a situation like that and did not know what to say. My other friend had been in a similar situation and she knew exactly what to say. Someone who has been through a lot in life can give advise based on everything they have been through. The different experiences will give you different options to look at. The more options you have the more likely you are to make a good decision.

The second reason it best to talk to multiple people when you need advise is because different people can help you see different points of view. When you talk to just one person about your issue, especially if that one person has the same opinion as you, than it can be hard to see the different angles. If you talk to lots of people they can point out different things that you may have not thought about. When I wanted to end a relationship I talked to a lot of different people about the best way to do it and they made it easier for me to see the point of view of the other person. Seeing an issue from different points of view will make you realize more about the issue and make a better choice. Also seeing a different point of view will help you make a choice that benefits all the people the problem is effecting.

The last reason it is best to talk to multiple people when you need advise is because hearing more than one solution can help you understand the situation more. Sometimes you don't fully understand everything your going through and hearing lots of peoples input can help you understand everything better. For example if your talking to someone about what you going through and they tell you how they see it than you would understand everything more. The more advise you get the more people are talking about the problem and the more you understand everything. It is important to understand everything because if you don't then you may make the wrong decision.

In life you will have problems that you need advise on. One person does not know everything so they can not give all the answers. When lots of people give you advise it helps you a lot more. The more input you get the more likely you are to make an informed decision. If you need help it is better to ask multiple people about it because people have been through different things, people can help you see the different angles of the problem, and the more advise you get the more you understand your problem.           ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
808E8ED91EED,"Why do people ask for advice from multiple people? For some people asking multiple people for multiple responses gives them multiple options to answer a specific question about some thing. One reason for seeking multiple options is that it helps people make a better choice on something then having one option. Second reason is that it makes the person looking for advice more comfortable with multiple options. Third reason is that they have the answer but not the right answer their looking for so they ask multiple people when asking for advice.

When people are seeking for advice they ask multiple people, Because when your looking for good advice you don't want to ask one person, Because when asking one person you are going to give you one answer/perspective of the situation, But getting multiple answers or perspectives of the situation makes it easier to make a choice rather then having one perspective. Let me give you an example ""I need help with studying for a test what should I do?"" Generic_Name said ""You should use the textbook"" see now you only got one answer but its better to get more, Because it gives you more options instead of being stuck with one option/perspective of the person. Let me give you another example but this time with multiple decisions. ""I need help with studying for the test what should I do?"" Generic_Name said ""You should use the textbook"" Generic_Name said ""You should use the online study guide that the teacher gave us to use because it has more information on it then the textbook"" Generic_Name said ""We can study together using the flash card I made for the test"" Now do you see now you can pick the better option rather than only picking one.

When people are have trouble with a advice and they don't know what to do. One person is not best option because with only one person you can only do the advice that one person gave you, Having more than one person makes it possible where you can choose what better option for you instead of being stuck with one thing. Let me give you an example ""what can I use to study for the test? Generic_Name said ""You should use the textbook for the test"" Generic_Name said ""You should use the study guide that the teacher gave us"" and Generic_Name said ""You should use the flash cards"" Then i gather up the information and I pick like, Let me say ""hhmm I don't really like to read from the text book"" so I dont do it. Then I think if I should use the flash cards or the study guide. ""hmm I really like the flash cards because its like a game to study so im going to pick flash cards."" Now do you see how it make it more comfortable?

When people already know the answer. They ask for other people to see if they agree with him like ""I know I want to do the flash cards, But should I do them?"" so then I ask Generic_Name ""What should i use for the test?"" Generic_Name said"" flash cards"". Then I asked Generic_Name ""What should I do for the for the test?"" Generic_Name said ""You should use the textbook"" . Then I asked Generic_Name ""What should i use for the test?"" Generic_Name said ""You should use the flash cards"" .Now I know 100% that I should use the flash cards for the test.

So my opinion on. If one person is better then 2 or more I would say ""No"", because 2 or more is just better because you get more options and you get more perspectives rather then just having one person to tell you something ""You Know?"" Like if I say ""Should I get this video game or Is this game good?"" and if many people say yes or the game is amazing, I have more information about the game rather then having just one perspective of the game.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
AF9AAA672210,"When you go shopping or are picking something out you often ask for multiple peoples advice. Why do you do this? Well it's mostly because you want the reassurance from others. It is a natural thing that we all do. For instance last September my sister went homecoming dress shopping. She brought a bunch of people so we could all give our opinions. But at the end of the day does it really help? Well here is how it went and why I think multiple opinions help someone make a better choice.

The first person my sister asked for there opinion was our Grandma. After a while of my sister coming out in dresses the first thing I noticed was my Grandma always asking ""Well what do you think of it?"" before giving her opinion. I think this is a very good way to give your opinion without hurting any ones feelings. You are asking how the feel about the dress before you put your thought in. But there are some disadvantages to that. Let's say she walks out of the dressing room in a dress my Grandma really doesn't like and she asked my sister how she feels about it and my sister says she loves it. Then you have a hard decision to make. Do you say you like it so you don't hurt her feelings or are you going to be honest and say you don't like it with the possibility of making her upset. Ultimately I know that even if I don't like to hear that they don't like it I would rather someone be honest with me then just lie and say they like it. And luckily that is what my Grandma did. And as a result even if that is not what my sister wanted to hear I could tell she was thankful for the honesty and took into consideration what my Grandma thought about the dresses.

The next opinion my sister asked for was my mom. I knew even before this trip started that my mom was going to have a very strong opinion on each dress. And I was not mistaken. Each dress came with a ""thats too short"" or ""that shape does not flatter you and the color is to bright."" I could easily tell this was overwhelming my sister and stressing her out a lot. And that is one reason why getting multiple opinions can be bad but again sometimes after my mom said that my sister would look in the mirror and realize well maybe it is too short. I think this is one thing that happens a lot. You will put on something you like and when you show it to someone they point out something you maybe didn't think about or realize. One example is when I was at Target one time and I picked out a shirt that I really liked and when I showed my mom she remembered that I already had that shirt. If she had not been there I would have never known that and I would have gotten the exact same shirt I already had. So even though my mom can be brutally honest at least she can point out a lot of things you didn't notice and help you pick the right dress at the end of the day.

The last opinion my sister got and the most important one was Beyonce. She has been a family friend for a while and my sister has always really loved her fashion sense. So when Beyonce heard that my sister needed to go dress shopping she was more then happy to come along. Her job was to help my sister pick out the dresses to try on and then give her opinion. Her way of giving her opinion was just to first point out all the things she liked about the dress and then something that my sister maybe want to consider. I think Beyonce was the best at giving her advice because she has to do it all the time with her music and what she wears for all of her performances. I think it can be very hard to get lots of opinions and not be overly influenced and not listen to your own opinion. So you have to makes sure even though you listen to everyone's advice you also listen to yourself and not just go along with what everyone says. But At the of all of this after Beyonce had given her final opinion and everyone had all agreed on a red dress that flared out at the bottom and had little white flowers. My mom agreed it wasn't too short and it was a nice color and my Grandma said it was absolutely beautiful and finally Beyonce said she was Grammy winning ready.

After this very long and tiring journey I came to the conclusion that ever opinion is important ans really can help you make the best decision. I would highly recommend getting an opinion from everyone you can but make sure that you listen to your own opinion too. It can be especially hard with really big decisions and so for those I would still get a lot of advice from others but also take time to consider each option and like about the pros and cons.                ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
12660C832798,"Finding a good friend is like getting a box of chocolate, you obviously don't know what they bring with them ; When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person. Seeking advice can be easy but following or or making a good decision from it could be a little tricky. In my response I agree to asking multiple people about advice for you can get different opinions, less stress by asking someone who has had experience with a situation and, also ask someone who might not be as close with you just for you to make a easier decision about things.

To began with, asking multiple people for advice can be less stressful in some way. For instance, you and your best friend are having a disagreement and you ask someone for advice about it but they tell you to just let it be. You are not necessarily going to just let it be like that you would obviously want to fix things. So you ask another person what they think about the situation and they say to talk things out between you two. You will think about the advice that person said and what the other person said, and think about which advice is better for you to follow.

Secondly, when you are scared to go trough something you have not done before and you are nervous. It is sometimes better for you to communicate with people who have gone through the same and something similar to it. For example, If you had an accident before and the result of that happens to be for you to have surgery for the first time. You would be nervous or even scared, not knowing how it feels after the operation. For a person to not feel like this would be to talk to a person who has gone through it before by their experience towards it. It can also help you be more confident in yourself and be less nervous.

However, asking for advice to your closest friends might or always be the case. Some people have the idea in mind that since they are your best friend they will say what you want them to say. But it does not always go like that, For instance, you get accepted to a university you had applied for a while back. however, in order for you to go you will have to leave your best friend, so you ask advice but they end up saying for you not to go because they do not want you to go and they will miss you. Later on, you talk to another friend of yours for their opinion and they tell you to follow your heart and do whatever you have to do to follow it.

In conclusion, It is better for one to ask different and multiple people about how they see things for it brings to more easier decisions upon yourself, less stress about over thinking about it and, gives you an idea of what you actually want.                    ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C8C168A9F3CC,"Have you ever went to someone for advice? Did they give you good advice or bad advice? When someone is giving you their thoughts on the matter, it comes from their own experiences, so you must be extremely careful to not blindly trust someones advice. This is why many people go to a lot of reliable sources, like friends or family members, for advice. Seeking more than one persons judgment is amazing because everyone has their own opinions and experiences, it could lead to better judgment, and it could also grant you with some internal peace. These are the reasons I believe that seeking advice from others is a very good thing.

When facing a hard decision, whether it may be a family or a friend issue, it is good to go to a couple of trusted adults or friends. This is a great idea because many people have different experiences and ideas. Lets say you want to go rock climbing, but without any gear. Some of your friends may say, ""Yeah! You should totally do it!"", or ""That sounds so cool!"". But what if the last person you go to made the same mistake you were about to do, and ended up getting very hurt. They would tell you to wear gear as to protect yourself because they don't want you to get hurt like they did. After hearing the last persons advice, you may start to reconsider your actions. Sometimes, people can give you bad and dangerous advice; however, many people also give good advice. So, if you just listen to one persons advice, you may find yourself in a sticky situation. While, sometimes listening to just one person can be good, you want to be able to have all the facts and all the opinions before diving head first into things.

Secondly, after listening to others advice, you can usually come up with better judgment. What if you and your best friend get into a fight. Sometimes, all you want to do is fight, fight, fight. But, that is never the right thing to do. When you have some sound advice, you can usually talk things out. When you starting thinking with your brain and it's not just you using your mouth, you can have a better end result. Even if the fight wasn't good and you both are still a little upset, it is better than not being friends at all. With advice comes less drama and less hurt people. When you take a deep breath and use the advice given to you, it is easier to take a step back and apologize.

Lastly, seeking advice from others can grant you internal peace. When someones comes up and helps you, you get a feeling of happiness. When you know someone is there for you and will stick beside you to give you advice, it boosts your moral. Also, when you are facing the problem head on, it can cause you to feel some uneasiness. So, if you have some great advice, you can usually feel more at ease. Finally, when the dilemma comes to an end, people will be proud of you for making the right decision.

It feels great to know that you have made the right decision and that people will be proud of you.

In conclusion, seeking more than one persons judgment is amazing because everyone has their own opinions and experiences, it could lead to better judgment, and it could also grant you with some internal peace. With all this knowledge you now have, you must make the decision for yourself to use said knowledge. So, will you go to others for advice, or will you just go off your own advice? The choice is yours.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
08C34A980940,"I think that it is good to ask other people for advice because they can have different mind sets on what you need advice on and might give you a better idea, you should also get more opinions on the topic because some people might be more mature than you and know whats right and wrong, and if you have multiple opinions you can shorten them down to the best points of advice then you can choose whats best for you and the route that you are going down.

However I think that when it comes to getting advice you should really know who its coming from not just a friend but you should always ask an adult for their opinion to because adults have been around longer than kids and chances are they will know how to handle the situation better. On the other hand if an adult needs help they could talk to other trustworthy adults or even their own parents to get the best advice for them. Most importantly I just think you need to talk to someone you are close to or trust because I would not want an opinion from just anybody especially if its important or personal because they dont know you as well as others. Once you have collected all of the opinions you could sort them to the most common answer you got or if someone told you something that you did not think of and you like that idea better than yours than thats another option you could use. I think that one of the best people to get advice from is your parents because they know you better than others and care about you more than other people or just anyone in your family, but you still want to get advice from as many people possible. If you need advice that is personal or health related you should go to not just one doctor but multiple and see what they all think so you can get advice all around the spectrum or if its really personal than thats another good reason to go to your parents because they can talk to you about any thing. plus getting advice from this many people might bring up reasons why you should take their advice or not.

Here are some reasons why you should get advice from older people, they are more mature and can tell you their experiences on why or why you should not do something especially if they actually were in the same spot as you at one point in their life, they know whats right and wrong plus they have a way of really making their advice stand out because they really do know what they are talking about, and they might care about the situation from a different point of view than others like your friends they wont just say yes or no they will put some thought into to really help you out like grandparents.

Reasons on why you should get advice from your parents, your parents know you better than anyone believe it or not so they know you and how you act and overall know whats best for you and what you need advice with, they will put more thought into the situation and take time to give you their best advice, and if its is advice about something personal you should not let every one know and your parents can talk to you about it without you being shy or bashful about the topic and most likely your parents will know where you are coming from so there is no reason to be shy about it.

Here are some good reasons on why you should get advice from your friends, one of the biggest reasons you should get advice from friends is because they might know a different side of you than others because your parents dont see you at school or go to the parties with you so there is a good chance that they have seen a side of you that is bad or some of the decisions that you make around your peers, another reason is because your friends can pump you up and put you down really fast so they might be able to really tell you why you should take their advice and not someone else's or vice versa, and you might think its easier to take advice from them because you know them well and you are friends and it might not be as intimidating as the other options they are also really understanding and care about you is they are a good friend, also like I just mentioned it should be a good friend you are talking to because if you tell the wrong person they can end up telling more people than who you wanted to know about the situation.

In conclusion I think that the main points are that you really need to know who you are talking to because if you dont then the person you asked might tell everybody things that they dont need to know and then you will be even more stressed and possibly get made fun of just because of one person that you now cant ever trust again. Also having a wide range of opinions can really show how much people care about you and it can really help make this process easier on your self. One very important thing is that dont just get it from one of each of these people get it from as many as possible ask multiple older people, ask both of your parents, and ask multiple friends because if you do it could really help. It is extremely important to get advice from all mind sets but there is one thing that I can not stress enough and that that the person you are saying this to needs to care about you if you ask someone off the street they might tell you something that could get you in a lot of trouble it need to come from a reliable source because you could end up in a bad situation because of one person giving you bad advice so when asking for advice you really need to be carefull and put thought into who you are asking this from. I think that every one needs to know this because if they dont they might not get whats best for them but I do think that is is important to get an opinion from everyone because knowing more than just your mindset on the situation can really help in the long run and make sure that you ask the person giving you advice thinks that their advice is best for you and why you should not take another route that is a big reason why you should ask multiple people then you just take all your answers and shorten them down to what suits you and why.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
C6BF2843D7D0,"When people ask for advice, why is it better to ask for multiple opinions? It's better to ask for multiple opinions because it could give you better advice.

When asking for one person's advice they might give you the advice you're looking for, but not always. If you go with that one person's advice, it might be bad advice or advice completely different for what your looking for and you might not even know it. There are people who might just joke around with you and give you the wrong advice. Also some people might not even know the answer and respond with something else. It's better to ask for more advice from people to help you find what your looking for.

Asking for one person's advice is not enough, you have to ask multiple people for advice. When asking for advice, asking more people can help because they can give you advice. Asking for more people's opinions gives you more options that you could choose from. In that amount of advice you could find and choose the advice that is needed. If the amount of people that you asked did not give you the advice that you need, you could ask more people for their advice.

In conclusion, asking for more advice from people helps, it gives you many choices and better advice. If you just ask for one person advice it might be bad or good. You may trust that person, but the advice they give might not be what your looking for. That's why you should ask more people, it helps you get more choices and you could find better advice out of the amount that of people that you asked. The advice that you get from asking people should be able to help you out on what your looking for.  ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
EF9D79A33BE7,"Some people ask only one person for advice, but when talking to multiple people it can give you more advice. i agree with this statement. Here are my reasoning's why people should get advice from more than one person.

First maybe they don't know how to handle the situation. I say this because asking more than one person can help you more on trying to find a way to handle the situation. Also getting advice from then one person is good because it gets less stress off your back and you are hearing what other people have to say.

Secondly talking to more people can give you more advice on what to do. If you just talk to one person it may not help but if you go to more that one person you can gather everyone s advice and see which one is best for you. Maybe the first person that gave you advice was good but the other people you didnt like there advice. From there you can gather everyone s thoughts and see whats best for you. And if you don't know something the best thing to do is ask someone. And if you aren't sure if you are making the right choice then keep asking until you get the right information.

Lastly maybe your just unsure. My reasoning behind this is when your involved in something and your unsure on what to do asking a group of people would be your best choice. This helps you with getting more ideas and help with something. Say i wanted a pet cat but i didnt know the bad things about cats. I could ask multiple people on advice about cats and that could help me so i could be sure i am making the right choice.

Those are my reasons why asking multiple people for advice is good. Because not being unsure or making bad choice isnt okay so its always good to more than one person for advice on what to do.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
38418C0F9D91,"Everyone has had a time in their life when they needed help. Some people ask for advice to help them with there problem. When seeking advice many people talk to more than one person. Asking more than one person for advice helps people make a good decision by, one giving them a wide variety of options they can choose from, and two by finding people who are more qualified to give advice on your topic than others.

Getting more opinions to choose from lets people find the option they think is right instead of having one option that they have to choose. For an example Generic_Name got a offered his dream job, but Generic_Name already has a job working at Microsoft for a much higher pay. He asks his boss and friends for advice, his boss says he should stay here at Microsoft while his friends say he should go to his dream job. Generic_Name looks at all the advice he got and made a decision to work at his dream job.

By asking many people for advice you might find someone who had a similar experience to your problem. For an example when Generic_Name asked his friends for advice he found out that Generic_Name experienced the same problem in the past. Generic_Name asked what Generic_Name did in that situation and Generic_Name replied with ""Go to your dream job, I stayed at my job, and I wish would've taken the my dream job."" So Generic_Name made the right decision, and left his job to work at his dream job.

Asking lots of people for advice helps people make a good decision by, one giving them an a assortment of options they can choose from, and two by finding people who have experienced a similar problem in the past. Asking multiple people for advice lets the person pick a choice they agree with or like instead of having only one option you have to choose. If you ask enough people you might find someone who experienced a similar problem making them more qualified than other people.

1C6B5FFBD027,"I think the reason people ask multiple people for advice. My reasons are 1. It might help them make better choices in the decision they are trying to take.2. It could give them a broader view on things.3. You might want to see if ever thing that the one person said would be the right thing to do. Lets get in to the reasons why i think people ask for advice from multiple people

Reason one. If you get advice from multiply people about a job or what college you should go to. The person asking wants to ask a lot of people because. they want to know why should i not go to these school or why should i get these job. They dont really know what they want thats why. they ask multiple peoples advice it will give them a better view on what they should do. When i ask people what do you think that i should do you think i should go to this or not go thats getting there side of view.

Reason two. It could give you a lot broader view or better prospective on things. Some times people will ask multiply people because. they want to see both sides of things they dont want to be tunnel vision on one idea. When someone is just tunnel vision on one idea. they usually dont make the best desion because they cant see if they like the other side or not.

Reason three. If one person tells you to go to something and your not so shore what would you do. Would you do what the person told you to do or would you ask around. I know i would ask people what i should do because if you dont and you make a bad dession that could ruing your life for ever. So that is why people ask more than one person about a idea.

These are the reasons why you should ask multiply people about a topic or a choice in life. You dont know may the one person you ask might set you up for a road. that could make you a millionaire or it could set you up to a path that you might not want to go down. which is OK you should hopefully learn from your mistakes.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

Second you could see another persons opinion. They might be able to tell you if a cirtan group of people will hate it or like it. They might be able to tell you if there is something wrong. They could tell you to get information. They could tell you to get the word out.

Third they could be effected by it. They could tell you what is wrong. they might want a apology and threaten to never use it again. They could want a refund. They could want a new one.

495D976147B4,"Every day you make decisions. Like, what you are going to wear, what you want to eat, and even who you talk to. Some decisions are easy to make while others can be harder to make. Sometimes you might need help setting your mind on something, so you ask someone what they would do or how they would make the decision. This is called advice.

The hardest decisions can mean the most and while making an important decision you may need to think for a long time. Asking people for their opinion on something can help comfort you and convince you to make a decision. But sometimes when you ask for advice someone could give you a whole new prespective on how you make your decision.

When being asked for advice about a topic you can be helpful in many ways. If you know a lot about the topic, you can make an educated guess on what you would do. If you know the person asking you could lean towards a decision you know would be better for them and help lead them in the right direction.

Sometimes asking just one person is not enough. Having several perspectives can help you lean towards a decision easier, because if most people agree with one way to make a decision it makes you more comforted to agree with them aswell. For example, you are picking what college you want to attend and are torn between two choices. You talk with an alumni of one of the schools and they said its the best school you could ever go to, you ask a group of people and most of them go with the same option because it will bring you better opportunity. You are now more convinced to choose that school because most people think it would be the best decision for you.

In your daily life keep track of how many times you ask for advice and how many times you are asked. Try always to make the best decisions and do what is best for you. Asking multiple people for advice can help make your day to day life easier by taking some of the weight of decisions off you. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5AE5BAD81018,"Sometimes, you can be wrong. Most of the time people recognize it, so you go to other people for advice. Seeking multiple opinions is a good idea because you get more input, you can combine ideas to make one super plan, and if someone knows something you don't, then you can correct your idea and make it better.

One reason getting different opinions is a good idea is because you can get multiple second opinions. The best that could happen is that you and whoever you are talking with can add so many good opinions to your ideas that you could do something great with it, like design a great video game, or develop a new medicine, or maybe make a way to keep our soldiers safe in combat. If nobody gives any good opinions, you might just get laughed at. Not a lot of bad could come out of it.

Another reason second opinions are a good idea is because you can combine them into one super plan. Lets say you were playing a strategy video game called Total War-Three Kingdoms. You might want to do just a frontal assault on the castle walls, and take them by force, but your friend might point out that they have heavy

Pole arms up on the wall, a great anti-infantry unit. Your other friend says you need to take down the arrow towers along the wall to stop the enemy from peppering your troops with arrows as you assault the walls, and also need to use

T

rebuchets to destroy them. Then, you combine all the plans into one massive one- use the

Trebuchets to both destroy the arrow towers and destroy the walls, taking out chunks of the wall so your troops can breach into the fortress, knocking the

Pole arms off the wall (effectively killing them), and taking out the arrow towers. Now that's good teamwork.

The final reason second opinions are better than only your own is if somebody knows information that you don't, they can provide it and you can revise whatever your idea or plan is. Say you are playing the same game (Total War-Three Kindoms), and this time you are defending on an open plane. You are maneuvering your troops into a defensive position that will be great for deflecting frontal attacks, when your ally tells you that they saw that the other team has a unit of the

Black Mountain Marauders

(a very good anti-infantry duel-ax wielding unit with the special ability to be able to be deployed behind the enemy), but you and your ally notice that they aren't with the main enemy army. Your ally realizes that they must be hidden in the trees off to the left of your main army, and that if you hadn't realized it, they would have flanked your army and taken a massive toll. So, your ally decides that you hold off the main army, and he uses his archers and cavalry to rain hell on the hidden ax warriors so they don't destroy you. How fun and violent.

So, second opinions are almost always better than one. Sure, you might know what you're doing, but ask trusted others what their take on the situation is. The reasons you do this is because more inputs produce better ideas, you can combine inputs into one super opinion, and others might know key information that you don't, so listen.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C1152A41E4C8,"""Hey Mom, I need advice on how to get a job,"" said Generic_Name. ""Well Generic_Name, I would go online or read the paper for jobs and maybe you will find one you like,"" Her mom replied. ""Yeah, I'm going to ask dad for a second opinion because two is better than one,"" Generic_Name said. ""Alright you go do that,"" Said Generic_Name's mom. So, why is more advise better? Getting advise from more than one person is good because you get a better understanding, more experience, and you can make better choices.

Getting a better understanding of what your doing is great because you don't worry. Say your worrying about a test and you go to only your teacher about it and she says ""well just study""and then you get a bad grade, but next time you go to three different teachers and they all give different advise and then you pass. If you go to more than one person you get how they would handle the situation and so now you have exspernce in it. If you don't know what you are getting yourself into than how are you going to be successful. You have a higher chance of being successful of you ask for advise than of you don't. Asking for advise may be hard but it is very much so worth it because you know how to handle that situation when you are in it.

That person might have more experience than you so when you ask them they will know how to over come that situation. Learning about what someone else went through makes you more likely to not go through what they went through. Old people have been through the most so if you need advise you will get a better answer from them. At some point in your life you will need advise whether it be for teaching or how to get out of a bad spot so just ask someone most people are willing to help. If you ask someone it doesn't make you a wuss it makes you smart for knowing how to ask for help when needed.

When you ask someone for help you are less likely to make a dumb disision. If you don't know how to go through something you have a better chance of going through worse things. Better choices equals a better life and no one want a bad life. Mistakes are made but that is how we as humans learn and if someone else made the mistake before us and tell you you won't make the same mistake as they did. Say no one makes a mistake in this world would we really know how to live and how to handle situations? Knowing your mistake and helping others who are going trough the same mistake that you went through is so rewarding and helpful.

Getting advise from more than one person is good because you get a better understanding, more experience, and you can make better choices. When you don't know how to do something you worry and no one likes to worry about anything and getting advise gets rid of worry. If you haven't gone through that situation and someone else has there advise will help you not go through what they went through. Not knowing what your getting yourself into is scary and no one likes to be scared about something they shouldn't be scared about. So next time you need advise with something don't hesitate because you never know what the future may hold for you. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
46462FB89C84,"Imagine a simple situation we have all been thorugh such as getting stuck on a question in your homework or assignment. What would you do? Most people will ask advice from their friends or peers, but there is a chance that their answers may be incorrect. There could be many situations where you feel that it is neccessary to ask for advice. For this reason, whenever you are in a difficult situation, it would be best to ask multiple people for their opinion. But be careful to ask the right people because they might have different opinions that will not be beneficial for you. Young people especially should follow the advice that they think would be most helpful for them because they probably do not have much experience. Asking for multiple advice or opinions can be beneficial by narrowing down the bias in responses, help you make better choices, and it may guide you through your struggles.

A reason why you should be careful with asking the right person for their opinion is because it is likely that they will include bias in their response. For example, when you ask for someone's opinion on which pet you should own, they will more than likely tell you which pet they would like to own instead because they have more knowledge on that particular pet. However, that does not mean that the pet they reccomend would be best for you. Instead, gaining more knowledge about each pet by asking for multiple advice can lead to making better choices. Although some may include bias in their response, their opinions still matter. There is no right or wrong answer when you ask for opinions because you are really asking for their thoughts. In fact, their advice may help guide you through a difficult path that you will have struggles with.

If you think about a difficult moment in your life, was anybody there for you, or helped you get through? Sometimes guidance can be what we need. All the advice that people give you can really be helpful at times where you don't know what to do because they can help you choose a better path that you should follow in order to be successful. For example, a difficult moment in your life could be a time where you got sick, and this could be the result of not following your parent's advice to dress warm when you are going outside. At such times when you don't follow advice, the results could lead to something you don't want. If you think you're better on your own, you could be left clueless of what you should do in different situations. Your mind would be blank and anyway, the next thing you would probably do is turn to a friend or a family member for advice. Your family and friends give you reccomendations because they care about you and wish the best for you.

Choices are hard to make sometimes, especially when it's between two things you love. It wouldn't be the best to ask others to make choices for you since the results will affect you, not them. However, asking for soemone's thoughts about a specific topic would be beneficial because they can help you out step by step. Even if you don't realize it, choices affect you in some way or another. Making the right choice can be harder than you think, so you have to be careful and think through all the possibilities. If you make a choice that you are not sure of or that you don't trust, the results can have a big impact on you and your future. For this reason, it would be best to ask people who have some experience on the choices you are about to make. This goes especially for young people because their brains are still developing, so they might not know what is best for them. Asking someone with no experience may not be able to give you the best advice. Knowledge is key when it comes to making choices and even getting the smallest advice, can have a large impact.

In conclusion, recieving advice from multiple people is better than asking from only one person or nobody. Everybody has had times in their life where they did not know how to react or respond to a specific situation. These are the times where you would feel that it is neccessary to turn over to other people for ideas. But sometimes, people who recieve advice are not grateful for it. People who care about you want the best for you, so they give you their opinions and advice so that you can be successful. Advice and knowledge can guide you through in almost any situation. Do not ignore opinions and be thankful for the advice people give you because they might affect your future.                                                                                                                                                                             ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

Asking more than one person on advice is a very common acurince. When asking multiple people on advice it can determ the best choice. In some cases asking for more advice can positively benefit you. This could help you if someone is ether experienced or if you simply want a second option. If you feel worried about the first disition or if it does not feel right. Or if you just want to here both sides. Ether way asking a second option is very helpful.

When asking a second person on a choice you want facts. The best way you can find facts is to ask someone who is experienced. This could ether mean that they know the pros and cons of your distion or they have experienced it first hand. You can do this by questioning someone who experienced your choice first hand. For example, if you wanted to determine weather or not you thought skiing is dangerous then first hand experience is important. In this sinary he or she could tell you their story of skiing. Trough this you could figure out if skiing is dangerous not. This does not only go for skiing though. You can determine almost any destion through first hand experience.

""Go with your gut."" This a very common saying. To some it might sound old fashioned but if you want to determ the best solution then you should follow this simple phrase. What you really want to do can determine your destion. but if you are worried or feel as if a choice is not right then you should ask for a second opinion. This could benefit you if the second person says that a choice is possibly dangerous or negative. Thats why going with your idea can devolve questions that you may not be able to answer yourself.

Making a choice can be also be hard epsically if it's a contervial one. If you find yourself stuck between two distions then seeing both sides can be extremely difficult. Seeking advice from someone who believes differently from the first person can help you compare both points. For example, if you are caught in the middle of a distion observe both the positive and the negative choices. Asking just one persons option on a distion is helpful but it can lead you into just thinking about what one person said. On the other hand, asking two people can show you the good and bad components of a both choices. This system can help you compare your distions.

Figuring out the best choice is difficult. But asking for a second distion can benefit you greatly and make your final distion much easier. For example asking someone who has encountered your choices first hand or comparing both sides to figure out the pros and cons. You can even listen to what others have to say about your personal distion. Just remember if you truly want to benefit yourself in a distion then seek out this three simple examples. You can Improve your future with the right disition. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EF5A8F9E551F,"When making a decision, big or small, it is very important to talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions on the same situation can make you think about multiple points of view, lead you to create your own version of the advice given to you, be a good bonding experience, and result in you feeling supported, cared for, and happy. When all of those factors add up, you are going to make the better choice to solve a problem.

Every person has different ideals, beliefs, and different ways of thinking. So, as you go around asking for advice, you will receive many unique ways of approaching the exact same situation. This will help you think about choices that never would have occurred to you if you had not asked for the advice of other people.

The best part about having multiple opinions is the fact that you can take all of it, or none of it! You can even make your own version of it based on what you think is best for you, by modifying advice that is given to you, and putting it together with your own take on the situation.

Another reason why asking for multiple opinions is a good idea, is because it is a great opportunity to bond with others and have extra help on a problem. For example, if there is someone in your class that you really want to be friends with, you can ask for their advice and have a conversation with them. If that person becomes comfortable talking to you, you are likely to become friends. Having friends with you can help you make the better choice when solving a problem.

Receiving multiple opinions allows you to have different choices, but it can also make you feel supported. Your community is an amazing place with an abundance of special people who want to help you be the best version of yourself. They care about what you do, which will make you feel much better about whatever it is you are going through, and help you make the right decision.

When you have no path to travel on when it comes to a problem that must be solved, make the choice to talk to your peers, family members, and other people in your community. This can allow you to have different opinions, make friends, and feel better, in order to work through your tough problems successfully.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B7B88E6FF395,"WaBam! That was the sound of her slamming the door behind her as she ran to go ask more people for advice on what to do with the drama at school. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. They start off by asking themselves what they should do. If they cannot come to a reasonable decision on their own, they go ask more people. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because he or she does not have to over think, it allows him or her to rule out the bad choices, and it allows him or her to be the least stressed possible.

The first reason that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that he or she does not have to over think. Usually when someone gets multiple opinions, he or she is going to hear the same one more than once. If he or she hears the same opinion over and over again, then he or she will more than likely go with that choice. Therefore, he or she will not have to think about the choice as much. When I ask multiple people for advice, I go with the opinion that the majority of people are saying, so I do not have to think about it as much. Getting multiple opinions on something gives your brain a break because you do not have to over think.

The second reason that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that it allows he or she to be able to rule out the bad choices. When someone receives advice from multiple people, he or she will probably hear the same opinion twice. Usually if someone hears the same opinion twice, then it is more than likely a good choice. If he or she does not hear any of the opinions that he or she had thought of, then the opinions are probably not going to be good choices. When I am receiving advice, it always relieves my stress when I can rule out a bunch of choices. Receiving multiple opinions can save you time, because it helps rule out the bad choices.

The final reason that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that he or she is not stressed. When it comes to someone having to make a choice, he or she needs to be stress free. Since seeking multiple opinions does not make someone have to over think, and it allows he or she to rule out bad answers, then he or she should already be stress free. When I am trying to make a decision, I have to be stress free. If I am even an ounce stressed out, then I cannot make a decision. Seeking multiple opinions is a great thing because it does not make you stressed out about the entire situation.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it gives his or her brain a beak, it saves him or her time, and it also does not make him or her stressed. If anyone wants advice, he or she should seek multiple opinions. Receiving multiple opinions will most definitely help someone make a better choice. With all of this information, it is obvious that seeking multiple opinions for advice is the way to go.                 ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
36C7368968C0,"When I was younger I had a big problem with something. I went around to a lot of people for help with my issue. And by doing that it helped me make a really good choice for my issue. Seeking multiple opinions from multiple people can help you make a better choice because some people have been through more and know more than others, it gives you more than one option, and hearing all of their ideas and opinions can give you your own idea on the situation.

One reason why seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice is. That some people have been through more and know more than others. Some people may have already been through the situation you're in and could give you advice that worked for them. And others have not been in the situation you're in and are just giving you advice that they think might be the best choice for your problem. And some people are just more wise than other people. Some people just know more about some things than others. Example you would not take advice for something in science from a cashier at a store than a whole room of scientist that say have the same awnser for your problem.

Another reason is that it gives you more than one option. That means you do not have to go with the first piece of advice that someone gives you. You can go ask a lot of people and listen to all of their ideas and opinions on the situation. And then look at all the advice that everyone gave you and take the best piece of advice and use it. Ex: say you go and ask one person for advice on a problem and they give you really bad advice, and you take that advice and use it for your problem and you get in a lot of trouble for it. You're going to be really mad that someone would give you advice that caused more problems than it solved. And it could have all been prevented if you would have asked more than one person for advice and made a better decision.

The final reason is that hearing all of their ideas could give you your own idea to solve the problem. Ex: say you go ask a lot of people for advice. And after hearing all of their advice a really good solution for your problems just pops into your head. And it solves your problem. What I am saying is that your brain is like a train and sometime it just needs help getting on the right track. What i mean by this is that maybe your brain just needs to hear other peoples ideas to come up with its own.

So in conclusion. Seeking multiple opinions from multiple people can help you make a better choice because some people have been through more and know more than others, it gives you more than one option, and hearing all of their ideas and opinions can give you your own idea on the situation. So asking multiple people for advice is very important and it can really help you solve your problem. Asking multiple people can also save you from using bad advice that could get you in a lot of trouble. So next time you ever have a problem and are seeking advice do not just ask one person. Ask a lot of people for advice. And by doing asking a lot of people for advice there is a better chance your problem gets solved then just asking one person.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
9EF6AC7590A2,"When someone does not know or is confused about a situation why is it not ok to ask multiple people for advice? When people ask for advice they sometimes ask multiple people instead of one. Asking multiple people for advice can be beneficial in many different ways depending on the situation. Like how Hearing about other peoples experiences and depending on the ending determines what you should or should'nt do, and lets you see stuff from different perspective to see different advantages, gives you more than one choice to choose from.

To begin with, lets you learn from other peolpes mistakes so you wont make make the same mistakes they did. If you ask someone about their experience and it ended badly then it most likely was not a good idea. But thats the good thing about asking multiple people if one had a bad idea you can always ask someone else to see if their advice was better. If they find someone that had a good outcome to their story that may be a good choice to make. But depending on the outcome you want to get ones advice can be more useful than the other.

Furthermore, maybe their situation is different from from the people they are getting advice from. Although hearing stories from different perspectives can teach you different things. Hearing how they felt about it and what they used to their advantage shows that you could use some of the same methods they used. Hearing varietys of stories starting in different places whether it be at work or home shows a different way to do something. Seeing from their perspective and not just their own helps them find advice that will work for them.

If they let one person give them advice it may help but maybe not as much as they wanted. Hearing multiple people can give you many choices on how to do something. They wont only have to do one they could have lots different choices. Studies show that people do better when they have more than one choice so they could do better when facing the problem. By letting them have more than one choice they can think about it and determine which one is the best for them.

In conclusion, people should listen to more than one person when asking for advice. They could learn from others mistakes so that they wont make the same ones. Can teach them different advantages they could use against their problem. and Give them more than one peice of advice they could use for their problem. These are advantages of listening to more than one person when asking for advice.           ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
24241413242F,"Does this situation sound familiar to you? You are struggling with a problem, so you ask a teacher, friend, or parent for help. They tell you their opinion, but the situation still ends up bad, or not the way you wanted it to be. If you related to this, it is most likely because you only asked for one opinion. When asking for advice it is best to question multiple people on their opinion in order to make the best decision. If you ask multiple people you will avoid bias, get several different perspectives, and have more information on the topic you need advice for.

When people give you advice, their opinion is most likely biased based on their political views, environment, friends, and coworkers. If you ask only one person for advice, what they tell you will most likely be biased on at least one of the things I listed above. The best way to avoid bias is to ask more than one person for advice. When you do this you will be able to recognize bias in other peoples opinions. You can compare one persons opinion to another and figure out what is good and advice, and what is biased. An example of this is a time when I was struggling with a math problem, so I went to my dad for help. He told me his idea of solving the problem but I did not think that it was the most effective way of solving it. After that, I went to my math teacher to ask for his opinion on how to solve the problem. I preferred my teacher's strategy more. I went home to show my dad what my teacher taught me later that day, but he said stubbornly, ""I don't agree with him, EVERYTHING was better in the good ol' days."" This is an example of bias, because my dad's opinion on how to solve the problem was based on him thinking everything was better in the ""good ol' days.""

The second reason asking for several opinions is better than just one is you will have multiple perspectives on that topic. Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is seeing things from a new set of eyes. Having multiple perspectives can give you ideas you've never thought about. For example, when I was in fifth grade I had to decide what sport I was going to play year round. I had to decide between soccer and basketball. I went to my mom and asked her what she thought of the situation. She said that I should choose whatever sport I thought I would have the most amount of fun playing and wouldn't get bored of. Then, I went to ask my dad, and he gave me a reason I had never thought of. He told me that I should play basketball because I can play that year round, and won't have to worry about the weather. After he told me that I decided that I was going to play basketball instead of soccer, and I was very happy with my decision.

The final reason asking multiple people for advice is better, is you will have more information about what you need advice for. In a way, this reason goes along with the saying, ""The more the merrier."" As the more information you have, the merrier. Having greater knowledge when you have a big decision to make can be the most beneficial tactic when actually making the final decision. Even the government supports this idea. When it is election time the government wants its citizens to be educated on who they are voting for. If the government thinks that this is essential, it most likely is.

Seeing things from multiple views, having greater knowledge, and getting rid of bias are very important tactics when making important decisions. This is why it is crucial to ask for multiple opinions when making those important decisions. If everybody implemented these into their daily life it would benefit them greatly. You should definitely consider this the next time you have an big decision.              ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
0A259B8AA9B2,"Sometimes when you need advice, you may ask one person for help, but have you ever wondered if it's better to ask multiple people for advice? Most of the time, asking multiple people for their advice on an issue you may have, will have many benefits. For example, asking multiple people gives you many ways to solve your problem. Another example, is finding which person that gives the best advice. Another reason is that whatever you need help with, it may be something that everyone has different advice on. In short, the reasons why asking multiple people for advice is useful is because it gives multiple options, it gives the opportunity to find someone with good advice, and it's especially helpful when whatever advice you may need, it's something that everyone has different ideas for.

As we all know, asking a variety of people for help can be very beneficial for many people. This is because you'll have many ways to solve an issue you may have. Think of it like a tree; the trunk is the advice you asked for, and the branches are those who give you advice. This is especially true if you see the longest branch as the right path, and the small branches as alternative pathways to the solution. However, you should always ask many people for advice on a certain problem, because you don't know if the one person you may have asked, is good at giving advice. They may not be good at giving advice, so that's why you need to ask more than one person.

However, sometimes you may not want to ask several people for advice on a problem you may have, and it's perfectly fine if you don't want to do something like that. For some people, it can take quite some time for them. Some people aren't very social compared to others. As a result, they may only ask one person for help. However, it may not be a good idea to ask only one person for help. This is because whoever that person is, that may not be good at giving advice. The point is, don't ask only one person for advice, because they may not be good at giving it.

Everyone has different advice for many reasons. This is because we're all different people, with different ideas on how to help someone else. While you may come across someone with the same idea as you, most of the time, everyone will have different advice to give you. Different ideas lead to more options, and more options lead to more chances for success. If you think someone's advice isn't the best, try to ask more people for help. While it may take some time before you find the right person for advice, you'll eventually find the right person. It's just a matter of when you find them, not if.

Finding advice can be hard for many people for many reasons. However, whatever the reason may be, don't feel scared to ask someone for advice. If you need advice, ask for some. Can it take some time to find someone with the advice you need? Yes, it may take some time. But despite that, it's always worth it at the end of it all. In short, the reasons why asking multiple people for advice is useful is because it gives multiple options, it gives the opportunity to find someone with good advice, and it's especially helpful when whatever advice you may need, it's something that everyone has different ideas for. So go out and seek others to get the advice you need! You never know if their advice is good unless you give it a try.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
7A56F29D9707,"Have you ever asked more than one person for a solution to your problem? Were there millions of thoughts swimming through your mind about how you could solve the problem you were in, or how you got yourself into that position in the first place? It's normal, everyone has been in those types of situation before. It's a common thing for someone to ask more than one person for advice. Usually, because the person they are asking is more wiser and knowledgeable than them, or they are trying to find the best answer, or even to know the mistake they are about to make. Let me break it down for you.

First, a person might ask more than one person for advice because they want the best answer. People like to find the easy way out of things and to not think too had about something, because they can get overwhelmed. For example, a middle schooler named ""Generic_Name,"" was just told a big secret from her friend ""Generic_Name."" Generic_Name wanted to hurt himself, and he had only told Generic_Name about it. He had also told her that she can't tell anyone about the secret. Generic_Name doesn't want Generic_Name to hurt himself, and she wants to tell someone. But, Chis told her to not do that. Generic_Name got hit in the face by thousands of emotions and got really worried about her friend. When Generic_Name came home from school, she told her brother about the situation, her brother said,"" if Generic_Name wants to hurt himself, then let him do it."" Generic_Name didn't think that was a good answer. So, she went to her mother who said, ""maybe you should tell his parents about it."" Generic_Name didn't like that answer a whole lot either. Finally, she went to her father who said, "" you need to help Generic_Name out by telling him all the good things about life and help him be happy, maybe change his mind."" Out of all the answers Generic_Name got, she choose her dad's answer, because it was the best out of all of them. A person will ask others for the best answer or advise, because they think their answer is a bad one and can turn into them making a mistake.

Next, a reason why others will want to get advise from other people, is because they don't like the answer that they came up with in their head, they want to know what others think about their solution, or if they are making a bad choice. For example, a 5th grader named ""Generic_Name"" wants to cheat on a test that he didn't study for. He thinks its a great plan, but he wants to know what his parents will think about it. At dinner, he tells his parents about his plan on cheating on the test. His dad said, "" you shouldn't do that, or you will get in a lot of trouble. Plus, you won't get a good grade. Also, you will have to take the test again."" His mother nodded in agreement. The 5th grader was glad he didn't cheat off the test, because he would have made a big mistake. He is relived to have people who are wiser then him proofread his answers to his problems. Lots of people like talking about their problems to people who are more wiser and experienced then them.

Finally, someone might asked others for advice to help solve their problem, because the people they are asking might be more knowledgeable, or have better common sense then them. Most people say that your brain doesn't fully developed until your in your 20's, so asking others who are more experienced than you is a good thing. Let me give you a thought, you want to get this action figure that is super rare, and theres only 2 of that specific one you want left in the world! All the owner needs is your credit card number, house and ZIP code address, and a copy of your birth certificate. You have this weird feeling about the situation, so you call your uncle about it, who is a mastermind on these types of action figures. You call your uncle and tell him about the figure and that theres only two left in the world, but the owner of the action figure needs all this personal data from you in order to have it shipped. Your uncle says that you shouldn't go for the deal because its a scam. He also says, that no company is going to need that much information from you to buy something. After your done with the call, you felt overjoyed that you had talked to your uncle about the whole thing, because you could of gotten into a lot of trouble.

Overall, it is a good that a person likes to seek advice from others about a problem they are in, it can save them from getting in to trouble or getting in the middle of something wild. Talking to someone who is wiser than you is a fantastic option, so is looking for the best answer out of the ones you got. Even knowing the mistakes you might of made is a good thing. These options can also help you build independent skills, then you won't have to interview people for their thoughts on things. It's okay to ask people for advice, there is no reason to feel guilty. Soon, people might be asking you for advice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5967C9CB596A,"When asking for advice, you probably stumbled upon talking to one person or another. You should talk to more than one person at a time when asking for advice from others. It is good to do this because you can get different opinions on the subject and what to do according to it. This also helps build social skills and problem solving skills, both being needed to obtain better life choices. But when asking advice from other people, don't do just one and have an isolated one-sided opinion, instead, ask more than one person to get a more accurate choice on specific subjects.

If you're a nervous kind of person who doesn't have the courage to talk to others, practice talking often to improve yourself so you can ask anything, anytime, without going through an emotional breakdown. And plus, even if you ask one or two people, you still could have a slightly biased opinion. That's why you should ask about 5 to 7 people on the subject of choice to get a true non biased, open, honest opinion. Also, certain subjects require more or less people. Asking if you can eat something could just require only 1 to 3 people.

Even asking a lot of people on subjects count as big social interaction which is a great way to get into a job, or even start a business! Jobs especially, requires being socialite to even have a chance in getting the position of the job of your choice. But it all starts with asking before taking action. But it is most best to seek out many different opinions to get your own. for example, video game designers have to ask probably thousands of people before even getting close to releasing your games.

You always have to be sure to ask a lot of people so you won't do something bad and lead your life into total plummeting chaos and despair. Getting more and more opinions could lead not only to better choices, but to a better life in general. You should ask for advice by asking as many people as you can (usually about 5-7 people), for you might just be able to get a truthful opinion that only you can describe as well as being social. some more beneficial include having more of a variety of opinions to create an opinion of your choice which can prepare you for real life problems that you need to be prepared for.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
D62BC508C6BB,"Have you ever had a tough decision to make, or problem to solve, and had no idea what to do? In this position, people often seek advice from others. When asking for advice, someone should seek multiple opinions because people have different points of view, unique strengths and talents, and have been through different experiences.

Someone should ask more than one person when seeking for advice because everyone has different points of view. If someone asks more than one person, they will be provided with many different points of view. With many different points of view provided, they will be able to see how other's view the subject compared to how they view it. Additionally, if someone is provided with many points of view, then they can decide which point of view will help them best overcome this challenge or decision. If they hadn't talked to more than one person, they might not have found the best way to solve their problem. Lastly, confronting many people when in need of advice and hearing many different points of view will help them have a more open mind. With a more open mind to ideas and solutions, they will better be able to make the right decision or solve their problem the best way that they can. When in need of advice, it is good for someone to go to many people to be provided with several unique points of view because they will help them see what the better choice would be, but that is not the only good thing that can come from asking multiple people for advice.

Another good thing that comes from seeking advice from more than one person is that different people have different strengths and talents. One person may be good at comforting others. They will be able to help someone feel better about their problem or decision. Another person someone asks for help may be good at helping them brainstorm solutions. By helping them brainstorm solutions, they will be able to pick the best way to handle the situation. Another person may be good at seeing other people's views. They will be able to see the person's point of view and see how their decision will affect others. Seeking advice from several people will benefit them because everyone has different strengths and talents they can share, which will help someone make a better choice, and there is one more good thing that comes from asking for advice from more than one person.

Lastly, one more good thing that comes from seeking advice from multiple people instead of just one person can help someone because everyone has been through different experiences. Someone they ask for advice might have been through something quite similar. Having been through something similar, they can help someone make a good decision. Another person may have been through something much more difficult. They will be able to help the person with a problem see that their problem is not as bad as it could be, and that they will be able to get through it. Lastly, they might be able to learn something new. Since everyone has different experiences, someone will be able to learn something from other's experiences that might help them with their decision or problem. Seeking advice from many people will benefit someone by learning about other's experiences and helping them make the best decision.

When in need of advice, someone should always seek help from multiple people.

Seeking others for advice to make a better choice is helpful because you get more than one point of view, you have someone you can rely on, and will have better thoughts on different situations.

You're getting someone else's perspective. This gives another persons opinion on the situation. Another persons opinion almost always overrides your own because they are giving you a different thought in your mind and it makes you second guess your own thought. It's a reliable source to use when you are in a tight spot. A reliable source is something or someone that you can trust to be right and it helps get great information out of. This gives you better ideas on how to do things differently. Sometimes better ideas that others say is all you need because if you have a better idea on how to handle things differently you have a better solution. A different perspective is like good cop bad cop they look at things differently.

Good listeners are always a good thing because they will listen to the things you say and will try to problem solve. Someone you trust and know will help you out.

EBBA36F7459C,"The Importance of Multiple Opinions

Generic_Name

Saddened, I starred at my grade for Algebra 1 Honors. That year I had gotten a B average throughout all 4 quarters. That night I spent hours pondering over the different mathematics courses I could take the next year. I could either retake Algebra 1 Honors, or move up to Geometry honors. Despite the time I took weighing the two options, I was unable to reach a decision and I decided to consult with my family and friends. When I asked my friends, many of them had different reasons and exposed me to several outlooks. My mom and dad were also split down the middle. My mom believed that I should retake the course to improve my grade point average for high school, while my dad argued that the the one low grade wouldn't effect me that much because there are many other courses in high school. Finally, I asked my uncle, a wise and intelligent man, what he believed was the proper course of action. Talking with my uncle helped me figure out the right decision which was to move on to Geometry Honors

The lessons I learned from this experience truly showed me the importance of seeking multiple opinions Seeking multiple opinions can allow anyone to see separate outlooks on situations, lowers bias in the final decision, and can lead people to reach a decision quicker.

Seeking separate outlooks on situations is one of the most important actions to take when making an important decision. Throughout peoples lives, everyone has had different experiences that shaped who they are today and the choices the make. Every single decision that people make is in someway decided by there past experiences, because those experiences are what led them to an understanding of right and wrong. This leads to people having differing opinions on topics. Talking to these people is crucial because it can allow people to see both sides of the situation, and the reasons that lead them to their decision. When those reasons are taken into account a balanced conclusion can be achieved, despite the differing opinions.

Another reason why seeking multiple opinions is important is because it will lower bias in your final decision. For example, if someone talked to just their group of friends, their friends may say things with the sole purpose of pleasing them, leading them to an unbalanced view. On the contrary, if someone talked to a group of people who didn't have their best interests at heart, it would also lead to an unbalanced view on the situation. For example, when I was talking to my peers about retaking Algebra 1 honors, those who had decided to move to Geometry Honors all told me that I should also move on. However, those who had decided to retake Algebra and those who were taking Algebra for the first time all told me to retake Algebra. When I asked why the later group why they wanted me to retake, most of them said that it was just so I could be in their classes. However, hearing the opinions from the former group of friends helped me see the bias, and thus effected my final decision.

The final reason why being exposed to differing opinions is important because it can help people reach a decision faster. When a person asks the people around them for an opinion, they are often bombarded with a plethora of different reasons. However, when they talk with one person in particular it is enough to allow them to finally make a decision. For me, this person was my uncle. My uncle helped me formulate the best course of action, which took into account all of the reasons I had been exposed to, as well as statistics pertaining to the importance of a high school grade point average. He told me anecdotes from back when he was in high school, and disproved the stigma that your grades define your success in high school. This final outlook was enough to make me decide to take Geometry Honors. Although one person finally tipped the scales, without asking all of the people prior I would not have came to the same conclusion.

Seeking a multitude of opinions when making a complex decision is crucial to making the right decision. This is because seeking different opinions exposes people to new ways of reasoning and outlooks, lowers the amount of bias, and can allow people to make a decision quicker with the aid of another person. However, many people say that seeking multiple opinions can confuse the person who is asking, and will result in more problems. This way of thinking is flawed. In most cases, the person will actually gain a sense of understanding about the topic and acquire new knowledge, allowing them to make an informed and thoughtful decision. Being exposed to several opinions can allow anyone to make an informed decision, which takes into account a plethora of reasons and results in a conclusion that positively effects their future. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5CE0853A33EB,"I have always been the friend of the friend group that everyone always asks for advice. I was so confused at first as to why? Half of these situations or problems they would bring to me, they would be problems that I have never experienced. For example, they would always ask me for relationship advice or what do when you're mad at your parents. I have never been in either of those situations. To be honest I would even ask my parents sometimes for help on what advice to give. This lead me to believe that asking for advice leads a chain reaction of asking others. Asking for advice from multiple people is very helpful so you can have more than just one view of the situation you are in. This has always helped me personally and also lead me to a better chance of helping my friends.

Asking multiple of people for advice can be hard sometimes. This can lead to hearing things you dont want to hear but you just have to be open minded. There are many perks of asking more than one person for help. It could help you understand your problem from many different views. For example, when they are giving you advice they can explain to you how the situation you are in and how it can effect you and others. This is helpful because sometimes we as people only think of only ourselves and not others. Asking multiple people can also be helpful because everyone thinks differently so you can have an array of solutions to your problem that you may have never even thought of.

Sometimes you just have to wonder why you are seeking advice from multiple people. The main thing that I have found that leads me to asking advice from multiple people is that they are all people I trust. I know they wont steer me wrong. Lets say you hear about the new burger place in town. You usually would go and ask for multiple peoples opinions that you trust, so you can find out if it is worth it or not and then base your decision off of that. Which also leads me to my second reason as to why we ask others. Usually someone that has some sort of experience is key. This leads us to know and trust their advice because they have been through it too.

Lastly sometimes actually taking the advice can be even harder than receiving it. Even though you may not like what you heard. If it's best sometimes you just have to do it no matter how hard it is. Taking multiple peoples advice and using can also leave you with a feeling of disappointment in yourself if you were in the wrong. Sometimes it's just better to take the other peoples advice then to hear the famous words ""I was right"".

In conclusion not one person thinks,acts,or even breathes the same. Every one has a story, and every ones stories are like a road they have bumps,cracks, and curves. This leads all of us to have our own lessons and morals. So getting others advice is always important to take seriously because it could have also been part of their past as well. Asking others for advice can also leave you with a trusting relationship and a new understanding. Yes I do believe that asking multiple people for advice can lead to a better decision and also lead to a better understanding.             ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
4DA58F8F319A,"Everyone has had to make that gut wrenching decision that could change their life forever. They make choices that affect people in many different ways. When making decisions individuals may consult different people in order to get advice to guide them through their decision, seek varying opinions on the topic, causing them to think about their decision in a different way, and even get additional information in order to make the decision better. Everyone needs to make tough decisions in their lives, but there is always someone willing to help make it easier.

Individuals may consult different people in order to get advice on their decision making. For example, this past week I was accepted into two private high schools. I had a difficult time making my decision, because I could imagine a happy four years in each of the schools. I soon sought advice from one of my best friends, Generic_Name. She said that no matter where I go I will be happy, but I may want to start looking at the decision logistically. I had not thought of the distance from my home to school. Her advice truly helped in my decision making, and I committed to the Generic_School a few days ago. In addition, this relates to the TV show,

Criminal Minds.

Agent Hotchner has a difficult decision to make, he may either stay as leader and split his team up, or he may promote someone else from his team and step down, in order to keep them all together. He had much difficulty making this decision, as he had a large family to support, but his team had also worked together for years, and he did not want to break their bond. He sought advice from Agent Gideon, a fellow agent on his team. Gideon stated that, "" Although you may need money, the team needs each other, we worked through all of our problems and make each other stronger."" Agent Hotchner took this advice and it soon led him to make the decision to promote Agent Morgan to be the leader. US Women's National Soccer team also had to make a tough decision about filing their lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation. They were concerned about what it would do to their reputation. Coach Jill Ellis simply quoted these words of wisdom, "" You miss one hundred percent of the shots you do not take, if you don't fight for equality then you will never get it."" These words then pushed the team to make a move and file the lawsuit. Advice, even though it may be small, may open up someone's mind to much greater possibilities, and make their decision much easier.

Additionally, seeking the advice of other might cause you to look at a situation differently and look at your decision in a new way. For example, my club soccer team, Generic_Name Youth Soccer, was making the important decision on who they wanted our coach to be for the spring season. We had not done well in the fall and the club was worried about our improvement. On the contrary, the club was weary that enlisting a new coach so late in the season may cause our coach and player bonds to weaken. My teammate Generic_Name gave them her opinion to help with their decision. She said, "" We have been playing with this coach for the last two years and have not had much luck winning, maybe his style of play just is not working for us."" The club had never looked at it in that way. Every coach has a different style of play, and although we might have better bonds with our previous coach, our new coach gave us different skills and drills to practice, in order to further develop us as players. Secondly, the US Women's National Soccer teams lawsuit has also caused some people to think differently. They recently filed a lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation, for the unequal pay of players. They were tired of not receiving equal pay compared to the men's team. Player Christen Press spoke out, "" We deal with constant harassment everyday from people across the country, still convinced that this sport should still be dominated by males, thinking that women do not deserve to be here."" The US Soccer Federation had never noticed how much hatred was present from the country, they never knew that the women were going though this. The US Women's National team is making great leaps towards equality, but the lawsuit is not over yet. Looking at an issue from a different angle or greater depth may cause you to look at things in a different way, changing your thought process.

Finally, by consulting others you may get inside information that might not be open to the public, causing a change in mentality. When I was looking into private high schools to determine which one I wanted to go to, I turned to one of my friends, who had gone though the application process already, to get her insight and knowledge about all of the schools. She told me all about the people there, and I learned that the communities in some of the high schools were not as strong as they had said. There were mean girls, and over working issues that I never knew about. This additional information was not on the schools websites or brochures, and I would not have found out until it was too late. Entrepreneurs also look for this kind of information in order to make decisions on what they should invest in. There may be flaws that companies do not expose, such as a failed trial, in order to get the most money possible for their products. This inside information may help entrepreneurs to find out what is worth investing in, so they do not waste their money.

The decisions that people make always effect someone in someway, good or maybe even bad. Turning to friends, family, and even teachers can help you make the best decision. They may give you advice that would help guide your decision making process, they may give you a different opinion, causing you to look at something differently, and may even give you information not exposed on the outside. Everyone's brains work differently, so next time someone offers their advice you should use it to aid in your decision.         ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
2D976D9E1787,"When people ask for advice why do they sometimes ask many people? In my opinion i think that asking more than one person can help you get more information than just asking one person. What can asking multiple people for their opinion do rather than just asking one person for their opinion. Why do people want to ask other people ask for advice rather than not knowing it. Why do they like to get multiple opinions on what their asking and not just asking one person for their opinion.

What can asking multiple people for their opinion do than asking person. Why do people ask many not just one person for advice, By asking many people it can get you more advice on the subject and help you know more about what your asking about. Getting more opinions can help you because it can get you more advice and by getting more advice helps the person asking know more. What does it help by asking more than one person it can get you get you more advice just in case you did not know.

Why do people want to ask other people ask for advice rather than not asking for advice. People like to ask other because the one that they are asking might know more than if you where to not ask . Not knowing what you want to know can effect you because if you will need to know it. Asking others helps you because it can make what ever your wanting to know easier by getting help and asking.

Why do they like to get multiple opinions on what their asking and not just asking one person for their opinion. People ask for many others opinions so that they can make sure there right and not wrong because if you ask for one persons opinion they might be wrong. The benefits of asking multiple people are you ca learn more than you wanted and know exactly what you needed to know. So in conclusion is better to ask multiple people rather than just one person because it can get you to know more so asking more than one person is a good thing to do so next time you want to know something ask multiple people rather than one.  ",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
FA34C91658A9,"At some time in most people's lives they have to make a tough decision. When faced with choices a person may look for the advice of others.

They may do this to get different points of view, to hear more experienced people, or just to talk to somebody about it.

By asking other people, they can see other things that they may not have realized. Things that could affect other people in their lives. Others can also make you see the pros and cons of the decision.

There might even be some people who have gone through similar situations.

These people can tell them about their story and how it went, or how to go about whatever the problem is. A few people may even specialize in the field relating to the choice.

For example if it relates to money you can talk to a financial adviser.

Even if their friends know nothing about the problem, people can just talk to them.

To bounce ideas off each other on what to do.

Or even to find a way to join of a bunch of thoughts together. The different ideas may lead to a great outcome from the decision that the initial person didn't even consider.

People come to others when they need advice to get different points of view, find an expert opinion, or just to talk it out. Advice from different individuals can help make a good decision.

FF9DB9D43F72,"Everyone has those moments where a choice seems impossible to make. However, just asking ""what would you do?"" to just a couple of people is the perfect solution! Seeking multiple opinions aids in making better choices because everyone is different, and information is the key to solving problems.

Of course, everyone is different, and it's not very hard to see. One thing that makes us all different is our opinions. This may seem like an odd thing to say regarding how that could aid in making a better decision. However, the difference in our opinions makes understanding something much easier. A better understanding of something makes us more comfortable, and making a comfortable choice is much easier than making one while being unsure. Another difference we all have is our thought processes, or the ways we think. One person may be very logical in their thinking, while another is very emotional. Asking both people what to do in a given situation may show drastically separate results. But upon combing the information received, an incredibly clear decision can be made. As previously stated, we're different in many ways, but what really shapes us is our life experiences. Naturally, as humans, we're born with none. That is why most babies will act the same; cry, eat, sleep, play, and repeat. Then, they grow older, yet they change so drastically. Why? It's because of our life experiences. A six year old will obviously have a different view of the world than a solider in Iraq. Taking these differing experiences into account when asking for advice can be incredibly useful. As aforementioned, we're all different in many ways, so using that as an advantage may be just what's needed when a problem arises.

As simple as it may sound, information is the key solving problems. What does that have to do with making better choices, let alone seeking multiple opinions? Well, knowledge is essential in making good choices, and so much of it can be gathered by just asking for a couple of opinions. This can be supported even more if the person in question is more smart than you. People who are considered smart are normally amazing problem solvers and decision makers. By asking opinions of those who are smarter than us, understanding how to make good choices and solve problems becomes much easier. Knowledge can also be gained in asking from those who are wise. Wisdom can open a lot of doors, and definitely new ways of thinking. If wisdom isn't important in making good choices, why have wise men across history been some of the most looked up to and praised? Lastly, asking the opinion of those who are similar to us, such as a brother, sister, or best friend, can be very beneficial. Even though they may think similarly, listening to them can aid in finding holes in your own thinking. In conclusion, knowledge, the most important factor in making a good decision, is best gained by asking the opinions of others whether they are alike, or not.

Making good choices is made much easier by asking the opinions of others because everyone is different, and knowledge is the key to making good decisions. However, at times it may seem hard to find someone to get an opinion from. But as previously stated, everyone is different, and theres always something to learn by asking a simple question.             ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B17BDAC0197F,"Have you ever needed advice but didnt know who to talk to. I know i have. Sometimes i would read a book seeking for the advice that i needed but couldnt find it. I've always wanted to talk to someone for advice but didnt know who.

When seeking for advice it could be very confusing because who would you talk to,where would you go. Would talking to a stranger be weird? maybe because you dont know them or their intentions. If you cant get good advice talk to your family they may have great advice or may know someone who can help.

Talking to multiple people for advice is also a great way to get advice,they'll provide you with different advice and mind sets. Having different advice and opinions can help you make better choices.

F32665CC66E7,"""A penny for your thoughts, oh no, let's sell them for a dollar"". Thees dutiful lyrics sum up in just a few simple words, how others thoughts are valued, and are truly worth something in the eyes of others. When making an important choice, it is croushall to get maltable opinions from your trusted pears. This is important because, not only do you get different points of view, but you also get things like different ways to execute your final disition and have a sens of accomplishment, along with learning from others past experiences.

It is extremely important to get meany points of view. The word perspective, means to see something with a new and an un-thought of point view on a topic or idea. When other people share there ideas with you or others, then that means that it is helping you whether you see it that way or not because you are seeing it differently. Perspective is one thing that we as humans have a had time with. The reason behind this is because we are very one direction minded, meaning we only like to think one way, and thats in our comfort zone.

Getting other peoples opinions will also give you other ways to execute your ideas or when you make a choice on something. Having different ways to comepleat something will allow you to get things dun sometimes faster and mabby even better. When make a good choice and you do it well, chances are, you will have a good seance of accomplishment. The better that you feel about your choice, the better the chances that it was the right or even just a good choice.

Also, its important to learn from other peoples mistakes. This is important because then you wont make the same ones that they might have made at another date or time. When you learn from others, you then have the knowing that they didn't when they were in your position and therefor you can make a better choice than they did. Youre your own person and fully capable of making your own dositions and your own mistakes. But learning from others will, in the long run, help you skip a few miss hap and allow you to do and be better than you could have been.

Over all, when you ask another person for advice, and you get other peoples perspectives, that is a good thing on many different levels. When people help you make a choice, whether it be big or small, you will always have the advantage of past experience, perspective, and the best way to carry out that choice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
71DFDFAB8621,"If you are struggling to figure out what to wear to an important job interview, would you rather ask for advice from a single person or multiple people? The obvious answer is to ask for multiple peoples advice to receive more people inputs and opinions on the decision. The outcome of a dilemma is normally benevolent if you seek multiple opinions because there will be many diverse opinions provided, there is a higher chance that at least one of the people you talk to have been in your position, and by talking to more then one person you can tell if the person giving advice has positive motives for helping you.

Firstly only asking for advice from one person is only going to allow you to achieve a narrow minded thought process. You will only be thinking about one possible solution, blind to the fact that there are endless possibilities. People all have different perspectives, experiences and beliefs, meaning that they all have different ways of examining a problem and looking for a solution. So if you take advice from a variety of people they may be able to notice possibilities you had not even thought about. I have been in a situation where I was trying to save up money for my sister's birthday. I thought that I would never be able to save up enough money for her gift, but after asking for advice from my parents and other siblings by putting all of there ideas together I was able to think of a solution to save enough money for my sisters gift.

Also by increasing the amount of people you ask advice from, the chance of talking to someone who has been in a similar position to you increases. This can help them find an easier way to help you since they already have an understanding of your position. They may be able to use their own solution, from there experiences, and adapt it to your situation to help you make better decisions. Therefore giving you much more useful advice then if you were to come up with a solution without someone who understands your position.

Lastly there is a possibility that if you only ask one person for advice they may purposefully give awful advice for their own selfish maleficent reasons. They may also try to take advantage of the fact that you are going to be influenced by the advice they give you, and make you have doubts about what you are doing is wrong. There have been moments in my life where I have seen people try to sabotage my chances by giving me terrible opinions. But by asking for multiple peoples opinion I was able to weed out the unhelpful advice.

In conclusion by asking for advice from multiple people the chances of you making better choices will increase. The result of a dilemma is normally benevolent if you seek multiple opinions because there will be many positions given to you, there is a higher chance that one of the people have been in your situation and by talking to more then one person you can make sure the person giving advice doesnt have any hidden intentions. These are all reasons on why taking advice from several people can have a better outcome on your decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EA57C6750829,"""You were wrong!"" Generic_Name said. ""Picking the gas car was not the best idea."" The sister then replied with, ""electric cars cost too much, I was just making sure you spent your money well."" That's when Generic_Name realized that he should've asked for others advise, not just only her sister. ""If only I asked others opinions on it,"" Generic_Name said. ""Well you didn't which means your stuck with this car,"" the sister replied. ""I guess you're right,"" Generic_Name said with a disappointed look. This dialouge can tell us why it's such a bad idea to only get one individuals opinion or advise. I think that asking more people for advise can help because they would have more choices to pick from, not make the wrong choice and be able to compare the choices with eachother.

First of all, asking more people for advise can help an individual make the better choice because they would have more choices to pick from, rather than just one. For instance, I wanted to buy a pair of sneakers and when I asked a friend, he only named one. So, I went on and didn't ask anyone else because I thought it was the right choice to make. After a couple of days I bought the shoes, I started to not like them because they looked too big on me. My friend himself said they were too. This was obviously the wrong choice because I didn't like them, and the reason I chose this, is because I didn't have any other choices that I could pick from. If I had asked other people, then maybe I would have made the right choice, or the choice I was happy with. It's is a good idea to have more choices than to pick from than just be stuck with one. Heres another example. My friend wanted to buy a phone but didn't know what phone was good and which was bad. He asked one of his relatives for an opinion and they told him which one to buy. After a couple days of using the phone, it started glitching out. He was furious with his choice. If he had come up to me or some other people, he might've been more happy with his choice. These stories clearly state why it's a good idea to ask more people for advise.

Moving on, having more people give you advise is a good idea because it would help you not make the wrong choice. Making the wrong choice could happen if only asking just a couple of people. For example, my uncle wanted to buy a house, so he asked his family and friends on whcih house to buy. He showed some pictures and they either said it's a good idea or it's a bad idea. Most of them said yes to one of the houses so he decided to buy that one. After a couple of months later, the other houses dropped more than half the price they originally were. If he had picked any other house, he would've been very unhappy. Asking for more people's advise helped him not make the wrong choice in the process of buying a house. This is why it's a good idea to ask more people for advise rather than just a little group of 3 or 4.

Finally, asking for more advise can help compare them with eachother. Lets say you ask for advise on if you should be friends with someone. Someone says yes, and someone says no. They both give reasons on why they said so. You have to compare the reasoning behind them to make the better choice. For example, I asked a couple of friends if I should buy a game or not. Two of them said yes and two of them said no. I then asked them for reasons and they told me all the reasons why I should either buy it or not. After hearing the reasons behind the choice, it was easier for me to make the right choice of not buying the game. I'm very happy that I compared the choices because that game was taken down for various copyrights. So even if I bought it, I wouldn't have been able to play it. Comparing the choices helped me make the better choice. If I just went with my gut and bought it, it would've turned to be a very bad idea.

""I love my new console!"" he shouted excitedly. ""Who told you it was a good idea to buy it?"" asked his father. ""Some of my friends said it was a good idea, but a couple of them said it wasn't so I went with the majority,"" he replied. ""It was a very hard choice to make but a lot of them said I should buy it."" The father happily told him that it was a good idea that he asked more people because it helped him compare the choices, not make the wrong decision and that he had more options to choose from. The kid was very happy with his choice because of these reasons. According to this example or dialouge, you could tell that it was a better idea to ask more people for advise because you would have more choices to pick from, not make the wrong choice and to be able to compare choices rather than just having one to be stuck with.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

5EBDFA356030,"What is the point of having to ask people for opinions?

What happens when you ask people fro responses and also does it help you making a huge decision?

How you need to help others make a decision?

Having to make a huge decision is a pretty hard thing to do, because it may be the decision you are taking for your family , your friends or even for your self. It can be any decision because after you make the decision you might not be able to change your decision . You may have made a good or a bad decision and after sometime when you have made the decision you should not be regretting about the decision you made,instead you should be proud of the decision that you have made thinking that you have done the right decision. And this is a reason why you need to ask opinions from people and also tell people about your opinion when someone asks you something. One more thing that you need to remember is that you should always talk to people before you make the final decision.

For example let's say you are buying a house for your parents and it is pretty hard to chose a house because you liked all of the houses you have seen so far. Now the only thing you are thinking about is which house I should be buying , so now the first thing you should do is go to your parents and show them some pictures of the houses you have seen and ask which one they liked the most. Then you need to go to other people and ask their opinions but never forget to consider every one's opinion because it is a way you show respect to each other no matter what their opinion was , lets say even if you think their opinion was the most horrible opinion anyone has told you. The only way to be nice to people is by showing respect to them. So now lets get back to the topic , now you have asked everyone their opinion and then you sit down and think about the decision that you are going to make , finally you come to a decision and then you go and tell everyone your decision and then buy the house for your parents. This is how you make a huge and a very stressful decision.

Now lets say you have a best friend who needs to make a huge decision like moving to another country without their family and that is a pretty hard thing to do . Its really hard to live without your family for years and years together, there is never so much fun without having your family with you no matter what, even if you live with your best friend. So now your friend has got a job in Generic_City and their family lives in the U.S.A

,he doesn't know if he should move with his family or just go by himself , he can't either leave the job offer because it is a pretty big company so he comes and asks you for an opinion and you say that ""I think you should take your family along with you if they are interested to go to Generic_City with you"" .Then he goes to other people to ask their opinions after he has asked everyone their opinion he comes to make the final decision , soon after he tells everyone his decision and does the right thing for him and his family.

Do you guys see how people make huge decisions and the reason they are able to make such good decisions is because of taking peoples opinion. When you take many opinions you can combine it into one whole decision and that's the whole point of making a good decision and the decision that you made can be the best opinions of all the opinions you had asked. After you make a really good decision , you will be really proud of it and I don't think it will be so much harder when you have to make other big decisions too. But still if you can't make a decision you can always ask people for their opinion. They will also be happy to share their opinion's. And they also might help you a lot to come to a final decision.

Have you ever had to make a decision for your self or your family?. Well if I had to answer this question it would be a yes because, I moved here from Generic_City and it was a pretty hard decision to make because my sister got a college and it was her dream come true.

Even though I was born in Generic_City

I didn't want to come here because I lived in Generic_City for literally 10 years and I had so many friends but at the same time I wanted my sister's dream to come true and she was also born in Generic_City and had stayed in Generic_City for 10 years too. But she still wanted to come for college here. So I didn't want to break apart her dreams and then I asked many people for an opinion and finally I came to a decision and now I am happily in America and so is my sister . And that was my final decision and I really proud of it because even I am having and my sister I having the fun most , she has so many friends and I guess she has never had as much as fun she is having right now and I am really happy for her but at the same time I miss her the same because I lived with her for long.

Every decision you make always has an happy ending because you alwyas will make a good desicion and and after sometimes you will be so proud of the decision you made anad you will never forget the desicion that you made but sometimes you may not have made a good decision so always remeber to take an opinion so that you will not have to regret it after the decision is been made. And sometimes you may not want share your problem with anyone and you still have to make a decision, then you should ask someone who you trust.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
A26B1E4B4703,"Hey, have you ever gone into a store and seen something you wanted but it was going to take almost all of your money so you go and ask a friend for their opinion. Well growing up, I would always ask my mom for her opinion because she was older and knew more than I did. Since then, i've always asked my mom for her opinion and I have saved a lot of money because of her. That's why I think seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because it can be a learning experience, boost their mood, and can help them financially.

When seeking for multiple opinions it truly becomes a learning experience because many people are going to tell you what you shouldn't do, and many of their reasons on what you should do aren't even going to be reasons you didn't even think about. In addition,many people will tell you things you didn't know when you ask for their opinion, Let's say someone ask their friend if they should get their favorite food and their friend responds with no, they have a lot a chemicals that arent good for your body. You get to learn why you should or shouldn't do.

Therefore, a lot of people are generally scared when you ask them for their opinion because they do not want to offend anyone. They might even feel like they are stepping on your toes when you ask them your opinion because they don't know how you are going to act or even respond,But if they tell the truth it might hurt your feelings on their opinion but it will boost your mood because you know that you have a real and true friend who is looking out for you. It's like asking someone ""Hey, do you like my dress?"" and they respond with "" No, not really."" you'll be a little sad but happy. You'll even be happy if they say ""yeah I like your dress."" People ask for opinions when they don't know what to do or if they should spend or waste they're money. Going around and asking for opinions is great because you'll be able to hear what other people would do and if you don't get what you or do what you want your mood will be boosted because your walking away with money to spear. In addition, you'll change your spending habits and the things you buy.

Finally, When you seek for people's opinions you tend to start bringing awareness to what you want and if you really need it. People's opinions change the way we think, when asking for peoples opinions it can really save us from many things especially financially. In today's generation they don't care about how much it cost they care about the name and label that comes with the shirts thats over one hundred dollars. They are wasting their money on something they are going to grow out of. Asking someone if they should get the overpriced shirt and then telling them no is going to help them financially because they will still have a lot of money if they just go and a buy a regular shirt. People's opinions can help other people financially because you could ask your friend if you should get this or that and they might not have enough so they go and borrow money and so on and so fourth they could go into dept, But if someone stepped in and helped them with that decisions and told them it was a waste of money they wouldn't be in the situation they're in now. My mom would always tell me ""the less money you spend, the more you save."" which has stuck with me through out the years because that is a rule I always follow.

In conclusion, People's opinions change and affect the way we live, we could never live without people's opinions. Always ask for peoples opinions because you'll learn new things and experience new things. You'll get to see different perspectives and understand where people are coming from and how they feel.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
93F5F89369D9,"Can multiple advice's benefit your choice on what to do? Most people believe that multiple advice's is better than just one advice. When people ask for an advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Asking for advice to multiple friends is better than one because of the following reasons. When someone asks more than one person they all can get a different response. The person who said their advice might say why they said that about their certain response. If people only ask one person, they might say the wrong thing to do. When I ask someone for an advice, they sometimes might tell me to do a wrong thing. After, I ask my friends for advice and then when they give me the advice, later on I think on my own what is the right thing to do. I think about what everyone said and the reason why they said their responses, then make my decision on what I should do. Questioning advises to friends gets their point of view of how they might see things. Their point of view will make you think of the situation and to make a correct choice. When I ask peers for an advice, later they tell me what they would do and why they would do that so then I start to see how they are thinking. Seeing different point of views is good because I can see the good and bad things about a choice. Lastly, I have to think what is the best for me and see the best point of view to see if I might the correct decision.

Advice from best friends is better than just friends! Asking friends for an advice is better than some person that doesn't do good things. Best friends are the best choice to ask for a advice, even better than just asking regular friends! When I ask for an advice I mostly go to my best friends first, because we know each other well and tells me the right thing to do. My best friends know me so they will advice the best for me. My best friends help me make the right decision. Best friends tell you the truth about what choice to make. They even tell you the good and bad things for both sides of the answer. I trust more best friends than friends because some friends just lie to make you do the wrong thing unlike best friends help you to do the right things. Best friends even help me up if the decision I made was bad, but its not always like that for peers. Peers can help me for an advice but not like a best friend because they really do try to help me.

For these reason I believe that multiple advises are better than one. Also, best friends are the best choice to pick for an advice. More point on views is better than one.       ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
243C2673D4A1,"In our third world era, people have lots of personal problems. Most of the time, they get too difficult for us to solve them by ourselves, so we search for advice from others. It's intelligent to ask for advice, however, people should never settle for less and only ask one person. People should always talk to more than one person, for contradicting point of views, more solutions, and more reliable people.

Listening to more than one person for advice will give the opportunity to hear different opinions. It's a good thing to be open mined, and listen to there point of view because people will most likely see there problem in a different way. They might even see there issue as not as big of a problem anymore, or that there issue is easy to solve, now that they're looking at it in a different way. Which will help them in the future when they have bigger problems. Going to a person for solutions to a problem, and then getting the same advice they told themselves, isn't going to help them at all. Seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice. People need those contradicting mindsets in order for us to see the problem clearer.

Asking for advice gives people ideas, and then they act on them. Though sometimes the idea doesn't work out.

That is why people need to ask multiple people for advice. There will be a higher chance that they will find the solution they need. Even if someone asked more than one person for advice and still they didn't get what they need, they could take the ideas they got and piece them together. Asking for more advice would never hurt anyone, but instead help people locate more ideas and more solutions.

As people ask for advice, they tend to speak to people who don't know how to give good advice, that is something they should avoid. Talking to multiple people will give others more information and good advice. People should also talk to professionals for better advice. They should try to talk to more than one because others may give better information for them or have a different mindset. It makes a significant improvement for finding better advice.

Searching for more advice is always beneficial, and it helps people understand there issue better. It's very unlikely for someone to get the advice they need on there first try, and most people dwell on the only advice they get, so it is important to always ask more people. First, people will find more solutions and come up with more ideas. They will also understand the issue clearer when listening too more opinions. Finally, if you speak to more people, you will find people with more experience and factual opinions. Searching for more advice will always help you, so don't miss out on the opportunity of finding better advice.                     ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C78D5D70A58F,"Have you ever wanted to find the best advice for yourself and couldn't decide on the person to reach out to? if so, just reach out to multiple people that you trust. Finding one person that can give you the best advice might not be the best choice to make. I have tried to find that perfect someone to help me with my problem, but I couldn't decide on who to pick. That's why looking for different opinions on your problem would be the best choice to make because using all of the opinions you got you would make a better overall choice, usually most people agree on one thing which could be the best approach, and if you only ask one person he or she might not know things about you that can help you with making a better decision.

Imagine you had the choice to pick between biology honors or just normal biology. Usually you would go to a close relative or your parent or guardian. But most of the time you don't like what they say about the class because they want to push you to work harder. Going to your friends that are at your grade level would be the the best choice because they could relate to having trouble on picking a class and can show you how they picked their classes. Which can solve your problem on which class to pick, leaving you with the best choice.

Let's just say that you want to play a sport but you are stuck on picking between basketball and football. Asking one of your friends or family could result on picking the sport that you might not want. Most people prefer other sports they you may not like. They could have hated basketball and loved football and told you that football would be a good sport for you just because they are bias on it. You might not be good at football and if you asked most of your close friends, they would know what sport you would be really good at.

If you seek the best advice ask multiple people because you could gather all of the opinions together and look at which ones you like the most, the majority is most likely right so you could pick the most repeated opinion, and asking only one person that doesn't know you well enough he may not know what the best approach is for you. As I have said before, some people don't really know you in a personal level. You could have asked someone that barely knows you but you trusted them so you asked for help. which would make their decision very ineffective. That's why asking multiple people about your issue can give you multiple opinions about the way of handling your problem. At the end of the day whenever you need a opinion on something, make sure to reach out to multiple people.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
9DBCBFD45366,"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because they can get different perspective from other people, more option to choose from, and other ways to solve problem. Things can go really bad sometimes if someone doesn't ask for more than one option to choose from.

First of all, getting different perspective from other people is anther reason for someone to ask for multiple opinions. Let's say Generic_Name was going to the mall, but when she got there she didn't know where this on store that she really wanted to go was. She asked a dude where it was and the dude said "" In the second floor"". She went to the second floor and did not find the store so she asked another person and other person said ""It's on the first floor next to the ice cream shop"". She went down to the first floor and went next to the ice cream shop got an ice cream and found the store. Generic_Name was so happy she found that store because if she had it asked the other person she would never had found the store.

Second of all, having more than one opinion is better right?. For example lets say Generic_Name moved to New York and it was her first day of high school, she had know clue where her school was nether her parents. Generic_Name parents told her to just walk to school and see where other students where going. She saw this girl with blue eyes and brown hair, "" ""She looks like a high school"" Generic_Name said, so she ran up to the girl and asked ""Hey what's your name"" Generic_Name she said I'm in high school what about you"" ""Oh same"" Generic_Name said. When they got in the school Generic_Name had to go in a complete different way and Generic_Name was complete lost again. However, While Generic_Name was walking in the hallway she was asking a bunch of people to see where she had to go. She got multiple answers saying to go to the same place. See asking multiple opinion is better than one because what happen if she only had asked one person they could had been room and she could had gone to the wrong room.

Lastly,

Another reason why seeking multiple opinion is good, is because it can solve problems. For example, Generic_Name was having a sleepover with two friends. They were making food in the kitchen when her mom told her not to. While they were having fun cooking the oven caught on fire. Generic_Name was finking out she didnt know what to do ""AHHHHHH WHAT SHOULD I DO"" she said freaking out. One of her friends said call 911 while on the other hand her other find told her just trow water it will be fine your so dramatic. Generic_Name decide that calling 911 was the smartest or lets say better idea. 911 came and solved the problem.

Overall, seeking multiple options can help someone make better choice by getting different perspective from other people, more options to chose from and can solve problems. Generic_Name found the mall she had to find, she found the place had to go and her house didnt burn down. Let's just say somethings really bad could had happen if Generic_Name didnt ask for more than one opinion.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
1C13CBFCF87F,"""Advice leads to experience, experience leads to success."" When seeking advice, have you ever received bad advice?

Bad advice can put yourself in unsavory situations which is why you should always have advice from multiple people. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by providing different perspectives of that decision as well as including insight on experiences that they have gone through that are either the same of similar.

Different perspectives from people can lead to better decisions made.

Everyone has a different background which can include their ethnicity, economic standing, political viewpoints, religion, social structure, profession and so forth.

For example, my mother is a full Korean, democratic person who is a teacher that believes in free health care.

However, my father is a Caucasian, republican person that works at a government job that believes in the complete opposite.

This in turn makes everyone especially unique and different when it comes to viewpoints and perspectives.

When facing a choice, seek different people to get a variety of answers as this can help you discover different possibilities and consequences of your actions.

Furthermore, different perspectives can also leave you with different choices than before.

To summarize, Different perspectives can change someone's decision for the better and lead to less negative effects.

Everyone has faced experiences and problems before in their life.

The more diverse people around you, the more different experiences they have faced and overcame throughout their lives.

Everyone can provide you with insight on the experiences they faced that could be similar or the same as yours.

For example, my father got caught cheating on a test he was taking, but he lied about the cheating to the teacher.

When the truth came out that he lied, the consequences were severe.

This in turn helped my father realize that its better to be honest than to lie at all, which is what he told me when I was caught with little integrity.

In short, experiences that everyone face can lead to more variety in choices.

In summary, the culmination of ideas leads to a more detailed and effective response or choice that can have less negative effects and more positive changes.

Looking for multiple opinions can lead someone to make a better decision by providing different perspectives of that choice as well as including much needed insight on experiences that someone has gone through that are either the same or similar to yours.

Always ask advice from multiple sources to get variety in your decisions and see potential perspectives.                           ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
688629E5EF45,"It is better to get advice from multiple people about something because everyone is different which means they could have experienced it differently. You will get different responses when you ask for advice and it can help you open your eyes more about the situation. It is a lot better to get advice from more than one person because of those reasons. Hearing about multiple opinions from different people can help you think about the situation more clearly.

Getting advice from others is better when they have gone through the same thing already so they understand what it's like and what to do about it, while the ones who don't understand could give you the wrong advice. And it's okay to get advice sometimes because a certain situation can stress you out and you would not know what to do. You should not get stressed about a situation because it can be bad for you so it is easier to get help from others because no one should have to deal with stress and no one should feel alone either.

Everyone always needs a little bit of help sometimes and that is okay because it can be really hard to have to do things alone all the time. Getting advice from others who have been through the same thing can prevent you from making mistakes and regretting it later and it can make your life a whole lot easier as well. Asking for advice can help ease your stress, fix the issue, and continue to focus on what you need to do.

It is also good to ask for advice about things and it helps you open up to people. Open up to close friends or family members because they care about you a lot and they would really love to help you out. There are lots of people who really care about you and would do anything for you in a heart beat. So it's really good for you to open up to others and tell them about what you are dealing with and how you feel about it and it creates a bond between you and the other person which is good too.

No one should be or feel alone because it can make them feel like they can not ask for help. It is good to open up to people a lot because it makes them feel like they can open up to you as well. Always get advice from those who are very very close to you because if they are not, they could probably give you bad advice and then you would end up making mistakes because of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
A369CA765144,"Have you ever mad a bad choice and needed advice to help you make a better choice ? Sometimes we all make make bad choices and dont think before we do. However its important think it out clearly or talk to somebody you feel secured with. I once made a bad choice in class but i talked to my school consular and was all better for the rest of that day.

However, theres different people you could go to for advice. Also theres different places or things you could use to get your mind off of something so you could make that better choice and dont get mixed up in trouble. One person you could go to for advice is a home counselor or school counselor. Counselors, are very helpful if your parent is working and you feel angry or sad and feel like you about to make and bad descions your counselor could help. They could take you out for something to eat and talk to you about the problem you having. They could even put you in a program too keep you focused.

Also, a second thing that could help you out is talking to your love ones. Me personally i think talking to your mom and dad. And most of the time people act different ways because they lost a loved one or somebody not in there life that they need to be there for them. And good things your loved ones could do to help you out they could take you shopping and buy you something you like to make you feel loved and know that someone is here for you. sometime theirs very hard trying to talk to someone so its very important that you go to somebody thats easy to talk to and understands you for good advice.

Next, i think something that could help you out and could take your mind off certain things is a vacation with your whole family. You could have quality time and know that your love you and tell your family about what been going on and they maybe could have a solution to help you out.

Also why your on your vacation you could explore different things and get enjoy different great activities. you may even get closer to one of your family members and you start to come come to them more for advice.

In conclusion, sometimes it may be hard not to make bad choice but its always great to to talk to someone you trust for advice. however sometimes it may not be a bad thing it may just be for and ordinary thing like needing helping pick out a pair of shoes or a shirt and you need advice so you can have a better choice.

04AAE2E8EFB4,"Have you ever asked only one person for advise? If your only getting advice from one perspective how do you know that your making the right decision. Getting input from more than one source is always a better idea than just asking one person.

Asking multiple people for advice is almost always a good idea. When you ask more than one person for advice you have different peoples perspectives of how they would have handled the problem. For example if you lost track of your watch and ask someone what you should do, they might say""Just buy a new one"". But if you keep looking for advise and you decide to ask someone else, they might tell you to retrace your steps. In that situation if you had stopped and listened to what the first person told you; you might of never found your watch.

It makes no sense to not ask multiple people for advice when you have the option to. Once I decided to only use one persons for advice. It happened when I was deciding on weather or not I was going to fix my roof so I called my friend and he said ""No you should'nt fix your roof it's super expensive you will be fine"". So I decided to listen to him and the next day the rest of my roof was stripped away by a powerful storm that had passed my house the other night. I thought about and realized if I had asked for advice from a roofing company they would have fixed my roof and might of even warned me that a storm was coming.

In conclusion the more people you ask for advise the better chance you have on making the right decision. Sometimes you can figure out the problem yourself but when you want someone else input ask multiple people to see what they think. So next time that your ever looking for advice on a problem you have always make sure to ask as many people as you can.                                                                                                                      ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EA7DF5E3AE3D,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. These are just 3 reasons why talking to more than one person can help you make better choices. You can get more of peoples opinions, you can get a better idea of what to pick, and it helps you get rid of the other choices.

Say you have to make a decision on what restaurant to go to and you have 4 choices. Theres Olive Garden, Taco bell, Sonic and Chick`Fla. Its easy to chose from but you still van decide so u call your friends. now you ask them because its easier to get other peoples opinion so Sonic gets 1 vote, Olive Garden gets 1 vote, Taco bell gets 2 votes, and Chick`Fla gets 2 votes. So, now you can take out Sonic and Olive Garden because they got 1 and the others got 2. Thats just one way to get a easier way to get a choice.

So, now you have a better idea of what to pick because you got other peoples opinions. Next, you have to decide from the 2 choices that yall left, because now u have a better idea of where to eat. So, getting peoples opinions helps you get better idea. Say, you voted again and Taco bell got 1 this time and Chick`Fla got 5 this time so now you can take out Taco bell and go eat some Chick`Fla.

Now, that you asked all of your friends for help it got rid of your other options. So, now you can go to the restaurant that you all have decided on. Because, you asked for opinions so now you get what you needed to get done faster, and now all of your options are gone because you asked your friends. So, they help you get rid of unwanted options so now you can go enjoy your meal.

55CE4FDD7C6C,"People ask for advice for any reason, especially when they can't decide. So why ask for multiple opinions? If I were to ask for advice I would go to multiple people and ask for their opinions. The reason why people ask for advice is to help come up with better inspiration or better ideas. Why they ask multiple people is to get better advice and different opinions on what they should do so they don't have to pick one certain idea.

Why should asking multiple people help with your decision? When you ask yourself for advice your brain may not be as open as other people. When I say that it means that all people think differently, for example many people have different beliefs and different ideas. Sometimes when asking different people you can come up with better advice or sometimes it can lead you to better advice. When you have multiple opinions it all could connect and you have your then you have really powerful and really good advice or it could just lead you to different places. But when you ask different people you realize the differences and different opinions that could help with your decision or take away from your decision. Certain people make good decisions and bad decisions but it's all up to that person to make one whether it is good or bad. If multiple people have enough evidence to support their advice, then that person would most likely choose their advice or add on to it.

What could help someone make a better choice? When someone makes a choice it could be good or bad depending on what they tell themselves or what other people tell them. When people ask for advice it would be really good to have evidence to support you advice. Asking multiple people would also make an impact because they all have different ideas and opinions on different things. But, when you ask certain people there could be a difference. For example, you could ask a really good friend for advice and then ask enemies that's what would make the difference because a friend would try to help you with good advice but when you ask enemies they wouldn't most likely do that. Another reason why asking certain people, is that you could be hanging around people who don't make good decisions and ask them for advice that wouldn't help you in a good way but, asking people that make good decisions would most likely give you good advice.

What is good advice? A lot of people ask for advice whether it's a friend, a relative, or a celebrity. When asking someone you know for advice doesn't mean it's good advice even though you have seen them on TV, you see them everyday,or you have seen them all your life. Good advice is when it benefits you in some way emotionally or physically. When someone gives you good advice it should be meaningful to you but, that doesn't always happen. When asking multiple people it sometimes builds up to make this really good piece of advice that could help you and other people in the world. People ask for advice for any reason and when they ask multiple people it helps them get different opinions of what to do and what not to do. When people do get good advice they seem to be a better person and understand how to give others really good advice.

Having good advice is really helpful from multiple people even though they aren't all the same. That's why people ask for advice is to help come up with better inspiration or better ideas. Also because they ask multiple people is to get better advice and different opinions on what they should do so they don't have to pick one certain idea that doesn't help them as much as getting other good advice ad using them all. So what's the purpose of asking multiple people? It's just to help support and give better advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
42BBC5BB7D71,"Is it better to talk to multiple people then just one person, or is it better just to talk to that one person? I think it's better to talk to multiple people because you might have some really good answers/responses, hearing what other people think is good and motivating you in life, and at least one of five people will have a good answer on a specific subject.

First, let's start off with you might having some really good responses/answers. One of them is the wide variety of responses you get. Half the time I ask people a question, they either give a good answer, or multiple people have the same answer. There is also some creative answers that you can get. One of my teachers taught me a little shortcut for a math problem and that shortcut made it so much more easier. Another way is it helps you understand the problem. I ask my friends/teammates what type of drill we are doing for hockey and they will respond. Asking a lot of people might give you some really good answers/responses

Second, is hearing what other people think is good and motivating you in life. One of the people that helps become better as both a man, and an athlete are coaches. Coaches tell me how to improve my game on both offense and defense. Another person that helps me to become a good person are teachers. They motivate me to become a more successful person in life, and also educate me all these facts I never knew about, they also help me get a good solid job for my future self. Last but definitely not least, are my parents. They motivate me to become a respectful man, an intelligent man, & always tell me to become a better person every day. Asking people questions to become a better man helps you become a successful man.

Lastly, the last topic is at least one of 5 people will have a good answer on a specific subject. One of the subjects is civics. I have a lot of smart kids in civics and they know what they're doing so, I ask them a question sometimes, on how to do a specific problem. Then there is science. A lot of my friends are in that class, so I can ask them a question, but if they're not there, there is still a lot of nice, good, smart kids in science. Lastly, there's Spanish. A couple of kids that I know kinda well are in that class like Eddie, he's a really nice kid and we sometimes work together on projects, so I can ask him questions a lot. When ask at least 5 people, you will definitely get a good response back.

I think it's better to talk to multiple people because you might have some really good answers/ responses, hearing what other people think is good and motivate me in life, and at least 1 of 5 people will have a good answer on a specific subject.

By asking more people, you get more opinions. If you are stuck on a decision and don't know what to do, ask people to help you make the decision. With more opinions you can look at all the different views of the decision and decide what is best. Sometimes people make decisions on just their opinion, but other times it is in your best interest to ask other people because they could have a better opinion or judgment on the topic or issue. One time I was doing my homework and I did not understand how to do it. I asked my parents for some advice on how to do my homework and with their advice, I was able to understand the homework.

Receiving feedback is important when it comes to advice and opinions. When asking lots of people for feedback, they can give you some suggestions and tips about what to improve on for whatever you are doing. It helps you build on what you already have and make it better. Once I was doing a really important project for a class and went in during resource to ask the teacher for feedback about what I could improve on in the project. I got some feedback on what to improve and did it. I got a better grade on the project after I changed it then what I would of gotten before. Feedback on something can also help for future opportunities. Those are the reasons why I think receiving feedback is important and helpful.

When doing something, having the best idea is always good, but you can't always come up with that on your own. If you have multiple people trying to come up with a solution, you can combine their ideas to come up with the best idea/opinion. There is also more creativity and brainpower put together when you have lots of people working to try and come up with the best idea. In school, one of the reasons why teachers do group projects is to try and get multiple people working together to come up with a really good idea or solution. Multiple people working together is how you get the best idea or solution for whatever it is you are doing.

I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. I think that because you can gather more opinions, receive feedback, and come up with a better idea. You should ask other people for help before you make a decision on your own.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
A5573D9DBBC9,"Everyone has different opinions. These opinions are important when it comes to seeking advice. People tend to ask multiple people on what they should do in a certain situation. Seeking different advice and opinions can help a lot because, first of all, the more opinions you have the more open-minded you could be on the situation. Secondly, it helps make a better and safer decision. Lastly, sometimes the advice teaches you a life lesson. When people seek for advice they usually ask more than one person, and its great because different opinions influence your view on the situation, help keep and open mind about the situation, and learn a lesson .

Having a clear view of a siutation is very helpful, thats why people usualy ask for more than one opinion. A clear view of a situation helps influence your point of view and descision. For example, a girl and her best friend got into a fight, and she went to go and seek advice from her other friends on what to do, some said to ignore him, but the others said that she should consider giving some space because he could be stressed about something and that maybe she could bring him a gift. She listened to her friends, and decided to make him a gift and give him some space unless he needs help. A few days later, he got her a gift and apologized and they both made up. See if she didnt ask for advice from others, she could have lost her best friend, or make up a few months later.

Being open minded doesnt only make you a better person, but it also helps make better descisions. Seeking advice from diffrent people, does help keep and open mind. For example, a girl's boyfriend has been acting distance lately, so she went and seeked advice from her and his friends. The girl's friends assumed he was cheating, but the guy's friends told her to be patient, and that hes perfectly fine. She decided to listen her boyfriend's friends. About a week later, he proposed to her, turns out he was surprising her and staying distance because he was scared he might tell her by accident. The girl's friends jumped to assumptions, and so if she hadnt asked the boyfriend's friends, things could have been diffuclt.

Believe it or not, advices from multiple people, could help you learn a lesson. Just like the last two stories, they all learned something. One of the girls learned to not jump to assumption and be patient, and the other learned to be more open minded about what people might be going through. There is also this story Im sure you heard of it, its called Slow and Steady wins the race by Aseop. It was a story about a rabbit and a turtle, the rabbit was fast and always sure that he would win, he was also selfish. One day the rabbit challenged the turtle onto a race, and the turtle agreed. It was the day of the race, the rabbit was already half way while the turtle was all the way behind because he is slow. So then the rabbit decided to take a nap, which gave the turtle time to win. At the end the turtle won, while the rabbit was alsepp, the rabbit was mad. That day the rabbit learned that slow and steady wins the race.

When people seek advice, they usualy go to multiple people, and that is probably because it helps influence your point of view on the situation, keep an open mind, and learn something.                        ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B343F5E7C7BA,"When making an important decision, it's inparative to pick the better choice. How can one do this? By asking for advise, of course! Asking for advise, whether it be on something small or something very crucial, has not yet failed to deliver better and more detailed results. By asking for help, you can examine different mindsets, gain more knowledge on a topic, and possibly even learn about somebody's past experiences. Most of the time, all you have to do is to ask for assistance.

Everyone is different. Their choices are their own. More importantly, why they do what they do is different for each person. They might even share what they'd have done if they were in the same boat. Getting a different perspective can help you make the proper choice for you. No matter the form that it comes in, getting different points of view can help bring clarity into your thought process.

You wouldn't ask a barber to do a butcher's job, so don't ask the same of yourself. If there is somebody with more knowledge about the topic or has been in a similar situation before, you shouldn't hesitate to ask. Most likely, it's a question they've been asked timeless times before. Getting an expert's opinion on the situation may seem scary but the majority of people would love to share their thoughts and knowledge to every person they can.

Ever told somebody that they shouldn't do something that you just did? Well then, by giving advise to an unexpecting person, you might've just saved them. Asking people about their past experiences can mean the difference between succeeding and being another failure. Whether it be about calling somebody or eating terrible food, giving and receiving advisecan save somebody's bacon, especially if it was taught from personal experience.

Rulers have advisors for a reason.

Seeking multiple opinions on certain subjects can help a person determine the correct path for them and those affected by that decision. Getting different points of views, more information, and reviews about others' past experiences can greatly affect somebody's decision making process. Making an important decision can be stressful, but there are always going to be people willing to give free advise. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Two of them say Mcdonald's and ten of them say Chicfila. Eating at Chickfila is probally the better decision because a majority of your friends said it. If you ask a large amount of peoplee what to do and most of thier opinions state the same thing then that is probally what you should do.

Ka-ching

! 3 near jackpots, but none getting the big prize. Leather wallets wore nothing except worn-down receipts and old gum wrappers, the green cash flying away ages ago. At a table, a man named Generic_Name sat down. He only had 100 dollars left in his wallet. Earlier, in a fit of rage, he ran to the casino, thinking of all the money he would earn. Only thinking of the jackpot, he started playing blackjack. Generic_Name pushed in half of his earnings. The dealer passed him his 2 cards. A 7 of clubs and an 8 of diamonds. 15. ""Hit,"" he said. The dealer passed him one more card. A king of hearts. Generic_Name groaned in frustration, slamming his hand against the table. He yelled, ""Again! Again!"" He pushed in the rest of his money, eyes burning with rage. The dealer passed him 2 new cards, a 5 of hearts and a 9 of hearts. 14. ""Hit!"" the man yelled angrily. The dealer passed him a king of diamonds. ""Tough luck,"" the dealer said. Generic_Name dropped his cards on the table and stormed off. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows them to see multiple views, lets them know the benefits and downsides, and allows them to see the different outcomes.

First, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows them to see multiple views. Imagine a couple fighting about money spending. The husband yells, ""You always spend hundreds of dollars every week for no reason!"" The wife, too scared to say anything, runs upstairs. In reality, the wife used the money for a local food bank, but she was too scared that the husband would be mad at her. These fights happen everyday, and if someone knew their opponent's view in a fight, then tons of fights could've been prevented. When you are struggling with a decision, you can usually only see your side. If you ask another person, they can tell you what is really happening and not just your perspective.

Next, seeking multiple opinions can also help someone make a better choice because it lets them see the benefits and downsides. Imagine a graduate fresh out of high school, trying to make a decision about where they will go to college and what they will do in life. He knows that surgeons make a crazy amount of money, so he decides to go into surgery without knowing anything about it. He doesn't know that college is crazy expensive, or that he has to go to school for 12 years, or that surgery is not an easy job. All he can think about is the money he thinks he will earn. Odds are, he will give up before he reaches the end. When you come across a decision, you usually only see the benefits of a choice. If you ask other people, then they can let you see the downsides of the choice you were going to make and the benefits of other choices.

Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows them to see all of the outcomes. Imagine a high school football player that can't decide whether or not he should play another season of football. If he plays another season, then he will get to do something he loves and he will get good grades. If he doesn't play then he won't be able to do what he loves but he would still get good grades. In reality, he would only get good grades if he stopped playing. When faced with a choice on your own, your own opinions cloud your judgment. It makes you think that if you choose a specific choice, then something else will happen. It doesn't always work that way, and other people can help you see that.

Generic_Name sat down at the table in his dining room, a grin resting on his face. On the table laid plates and bowls of different sizes and colors. On each different bowl lay a different soup or salad. On one there was a salad that looked like it had captured the rainbow, and on another there was a salad with lettuce that was the deepest green he had ever seen. Sandwiches stood on every plate, all changing in variety. On a blue plate there was a sandwich with the ripest cheese and on another there was brown ham that was charred just enough at the edges. It all looked like a food commercial with rows and rows of food. ""Kids, get down here! Dinner is ready!"" Generic_Name shouted. Upstairs you could hear bubbly laughter coming from Generic_Name's two children. His kids rushed downstairs, and Generic_Name's wife came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. ""I'm so proud of you,"" she said. The kids got to the dining room and their mouths were wide in shock. ""You made us a feast, Dad!"" one of them said. Generic_Name nodded in response. ""Yes, yes I did."" It had been over 3 years since Generic_Name had last gambled. He had gotten care from his family and he had realized that gambling rarely had benefits, its outcome was usually negative, and that everyone around him was hurting because of it.

447812A6FB58,"Tap ! Tap ! Tap ! is the sound of me texting in the group chat. My friend wanted to know what we think about him instead of just asking me. Maybe the more opinions the more he knows about himself.

Opinions are sometimes things we hear in life. Sometimes good sometimes bad but people still hear them. More people telling their options about you the more you know about yourself.

I know this guy from YouTube who dose a lot of videos but he gets a lot of hate. The things he post is hated by his viewers. He never knew why they had a problem with the videos but he did not. A fan texted him saying that his videos are horrible but it was only one fan so he did not pay it no mind. One day he went live for a Q and A video but all everyone was telling him there opinions instead of questions. So he finally realized that the first person to text him was not the only one with opinions. So here on out he started to make contents his fans liked.

Opinions are better asked to a group then one person. One person could tell you have their opinions about you but you might just brush it off thinking only he thinks about me this way. If you had more than one person to tell you that same thing then you will think I didn't know they all felt this way about me. So a group is better then one when telling opinions.

In conclusion it's okay to ask one person for there opinions about you but your better of asking more people their opinions about you to. Always ask how people feel about your ways to better yourself. A group is better then one.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
7770B90F2FEF,"Imagine a lost, confused version of yourself. Perhaps it's an essay, a project, or a personal situation that has you conflicted. You have no idea what to do or what to think of. You are stuck. The first thing that pops into your head is to consult your peers, but not just one. Asking for advice from more than one person has many upsides. You can see what others think of your situation, there can be many different thoughts. Someone may suggest a better idea to you than others, and most importantly, it is always beneficial for you to consider a different perspective.

Seeing what others think of your situation is extremely important, it's a no-brainer. There could be multiple ideas that you didn't even think of before. For example, if you had a ton of homework, there are many different things that people could suggest. Do the hardest things first, do the easiest things first, or just wait until the next day to complete it all. They all have different opinions, but you can get it all from just asking multiple people for advice.

However, some people may have better ideas than others. Not all advice given is automatically good. Let's say, for example, you are planning to redecorate your bedroom. Someone offers a neon-yellow pillow for your chair. You think to yourself, no way . Someone else tells you to hang up squares cut out from cardboard around the border of the entrance. You think, huh, that's not such a bad idea , until you ask one more person. They suggest that you declutter your shelf and invest in new curtains for a clean and bright look. Brilliant! The third suggestion is far better than the rest.

Lastly, it is crucial that you consider a different perspective other than your own. Consulting others for advice can help you do that. Perhaps your situation isn't as horrible as you thought, maybe it could be easily fixed and dealt with. People other than yourself can help you see the good things in bad situations. You could have this sense of relief from just consulting someone for their opinion. Simple as that!

Asking more than one person for advice is critical. You can see what others think, receive many different opinions that are better than the others, and view your dilemma in a new perspective. After all of that, your situation could seem easier to understand and not so terrible as you thought. Asking just one person for their thoughts is a mistake, do not forget to ask another!",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
AE7DE878CED5,"Imagine having a problem that no matter how hard you try, you can't figure out a way to solve it. Many of this have this issue often that it recalls to getting advice. Advice can help us in situations that we can't find an answer to our problems. Whether its asking a friend, a family member, coworker, neighbor, or anyone else that you can trust to give you a reasonably good answer to your problem. Many people ask more than just one person for advice, seeking different ways to solve their problem, and that results to making good choices. Seeking advice from multiple opinions can help people make better choices because they can view different viewpoints from others, have a different understanding of the problem, and can find various way to solve the problem.

When asking for advice, its smart to view different viewpoints. Having advice from different viewpoints can conclude to various amount of opinions that the person giving you advice has. Talking to one person over and over again doesn't help with solving your problem, even many people do that today. Many people that I have known have gone through a similar problem, asking one person over and over again, and then once they told someone else the problem that they had, they found a different viewpoint of what the first person was giving them. Since then when they have a problem, they go to different people and asking for advice because it helps them in a way to understand the problem in different ways. This can be effective in problems people have that they can view viewpoints from other, and get different opinions from each one, finding a way to solve the problem more quicker and more easier and less stressful. Instead of making a bad choice, the person can make a good choice that could help solve the problem and make a benefit in their lives.

While different viewpoints help the person gain opinions from other people, it also has an effect on different understanding of the problem or situation. By seeking multiple opinions from other people, it can help the person get a better understanding of the problem, and help them find a solution that can hopefully can resolve the problem. When a different understanding is taken place, the person who has the problem can visualize the ending result, as one of my friend said to me over a discussion. When he a found a different understanding of the problem, he concluded that it helped him find a shortcut to a solution, and it helped him visualize the problem in a way that helped him find a way to solve the problem. Different understandings can make a person feel that there are easier and less stressful ways to solve a problem, they can understand how the problem was caused, and how to find a way to solve it. This briefly ties in with the person making a better choice about the problem linking to a different understanding because it helps the person really figure out how it can be solved, which could be finding one solution, or multiple solutions that can help the person understand what there dealing with and how they can solve the problem without having to panic that one solution could lead to bad things that could negatively impact there life, but with a different understanding of the problem, it can help the person make a better choice to the problem, and find an easy solution that doesn't do any harm to the persons life.

Lastly, when seeking multiple opinions from other, it can help the person find multiple ways to solve their problem than just talking to one person. This can benefit the person because it can help them find more easier ways to solve their situation. When people have problems and ask more than one person for advice, it can result into find more ways to solve the situation because the person can find solutions that can either cause more harm to the persons life by making a bad choice, or just finding more than one choices that could the persons lives in many different ways. Having more than one solution to the problem is a good thing because when you try to solve the problem and it doesn't work out, you can always find more ways to try to solve the problem until you find a way that it works out for you. Finding multiple choices to solve a problem also ties in with different viewpoints and a different understanding of the problem. When these are applied, they can both help the person find multiple solutions because with different viewpoints, they can get others opinions and figure out an answer there, and with a different understanding of the problem, the person can find a deeper meaning of the problem, and find a easier solution there. Finding multiple ways to solve a problem can help lead people to better choices because when receiving advice from other people, it can lead to having multiple ways to solve the problem.

People asking for advice almost all the time when they have a problem to deal with. They can get answers from various amount of people, no matter who it is. Seeking advice from multiple opinions can help people make better choices because they can view different viewpoints from others, have a different understanding of the problem, and can find multiple ways to solve the problem. No matter in any situation, people can always find advice that can always lead them to find a solution.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
4E07EED92E2E,"Hey, most people ask for advise from others, do you?

Advise from others can be helpful because you can make your own opinion base off others. Dont have to do much research. Also it can be easier on your self. From that do you think advise from others is helpful.

Have you ever thought about how much easier it will be on your self getting advice from others is? You can easily just ask others instead of going with your own advise. Going with your own advise all the time is not gonna get you very far.

You could look it up and, thats a lot work. Well do you think thats easier.

I think making your own opinion base on others would help you majorly. Say your asking people how many times a week should you walk your dog. your gonna get a lot of different answers. then as you record your info you can make your own thing about that reason. Making your own opinion base in others would work you see.

Researching things maybe your go to am i right? Your probably like yeah i'm gonna go an look this up, but some things you can trust the internet. Also you need to be social in your life so go out there and ask questions. I dont think you should research but so people do . see all opinion mater. Do you like researching stuff?

When people ask for advise the will sometimes ask others. do you think you would ask or just research or no be a social butterfly. i think you should make your own opinions base off others.

3CC68E5F3802,"When your looking for advice go to multiple people that you trust when seeking their advice. Asking more than one person can lead you to the right answers or choices you have to decided to make. Asking more people can give you more choices and ideas to choose about something. Hearing multiple people and their opinions can make you feel good about your choice and not make you regret the choice you chosen. Some people might have bad ideas and some might have good ideas,put those together and the right choice is there for you.

Asking more than one person can lead you to making the right choice or answers because some people might have bad ideas and some may have good ideas. Hearing people bad ideas will shorten your choices of making a bad choice about something that can't be undo. Hearing other people good ideas can give you even more good choices to add on to your choose you chosen. Getting advice from other people is a good thing also because some people are going to tell you what you want to here,but most people is going to tell you what you don't want to here. The right answers is always what you don't want to here because the people that tells you what you want to here is just trying to make you feel better than telling you the right answer.

Another reason for asking multiple people you can get more ideas about something. Everybody is not the same, people like different things so when asking multiple people rather than one person you can get different ideas from everybody to come up with your own idea. Some people are creative and good thinkers when it comes to giving advice or ideas so when you asking one person something you only hearing one person idea and advice instead you can be listening to multiple people. If you only asking one person you can get either a bad choice or a good answers but when asking multiple people you can most likely get a good choice. You just have to trust the people your seeking for advice and ideas from to make your choice a good choice.

Finally when your Hearing more than one person advice or idea you can feel like you made the right choice because you heard all these bad and good advice or ideas from other people. Other people who are different form each other,who have different personality and ideas. This makes you not regret the choice you chosen because all the people you trust gave you advice ad ideas so all you got to do is put everybody opinion together and come up with your choice. If you only took advice and ideas form one person you would second guess yourself because you heard one advice that might be bad or good. Everybody is creative in their own way and at different things not just one person.

Conclusion is that people should go to multiple people instead of one person. They want to make a good choice so going to multiple people you can hear different advice or ideas than hearing one person. Going to multiple people that you trust and won't tell you what you want to hear is going to lead you to the right choice. Ask people who are creative and hard thinkers they will give great advice or ideas. when coming up with your choice take everybody advice and yours and you will get the right choice or idea about something.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

Whether it be as small as what to eat for lunch or as big as what job you want to have for the rest of your life, but some people try to get others opinions to help make these decisions. Getting opinions from other people to help make decisions can help with getting a different point of view , having more experience in a topic, and having more knowledge about a topic .

Something someone might have that you dont is a different point of view(POV). Someone else might view someone differently,whether it be a better or a worse POV. You might have seen this person as a good person all your life but your friend might think otherwise. Someone else also might think of somewhere differently because where the live or have been. For example, you might think Orlando, FL is great place to visit and have a good time at but someone who lives there might think its annoying with fireworks going off all the time. Someone else might think of times or events differently too. For example you might think December is the best time of the year with all the holidays and family but someone else might think its stressful to try and please everyone. If your trying to make an important decision, try to get someone else point of view, it might help you.

Another reason you might want to get advice from someone else is is they might have more experience in a topic than you . Someone might have been around different people more than you. This means they might have social skills than you or can talk in front of a crowd better than you. Someone might have been different or more places than you. This might make them better navigators or know more things about place than you. Someone else might know more than you by what they do or have done for living. For example, if you want to race cars when you grow up dont ask a plumber how to race cars, ask someone who has experience in that industry. If you need advice always to try to get it from someone who has more experience in the topic than you.

In my opinion the most important reason you should get advice from others is if they have more knowledge than you about the topic. Someone else might have know more about people and how that act more than you. getting advice from them might help decide who to associate yourself with. Someone else might also have gone to school for learning about a specific topic. If you are also interested in the same topic they went to school for it will definitely help getting advice from them than it will be from anyone else. Someone else might have more information about a place than you. They can help you decide where to take a vacation to, what to do or where to stay on vacation. Getting advice from someone who has more knowledge on the topic will definitely help you make the right decision.

I think getting advice from other people is great. it can help you get a different Point of view on someone or something, they might have more experience or exposure to a topic than you, and they might just have more knowledge than you on the topic. So the next time you need advice make sure to consider what the people you are getting advice from have been through before in there life, it will effect the advice they give you. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
BBDA39C84AF7,"Having different opinions for advice is a good thing. If someone asks multiple people advice on a problem then the outcome would be their is different answers for different people. When they get different answers from different people then they can narrow the most logical answer from the different people. Finding multiple opinions is the best way to correct or enforce your idea or create an idea. That is why having multiple opinions on a subject is a good thing.

If you go up to one of your friends and ask for some advice. Then, you ask someone else about that same advice. After you will probably get a difference in opinions. Although it is good to have multiple opinions your not always going to get a straight answer. like if you ask someone something that they are well knowledge in, and someone who is least knowledge in. Who do you think the best person to ask about that subject is would be. the well knowledge right well not entirely just because they are well knowledge about it does not mean that they are experts in that subject. The less knowledge person could know something that the well knowledge person does not know so that is why having multiple opinions is not entirely good.

When someone gets different opinions on a subject then they will try and narrow the opinions down in a logical manner. Like if someone has 5 candidacies and they ask each person separately a majority of the candidates will have different answers. So, if someone has both of the same answers then the person who is asking will probably lean more to the similar answers. Just because the people go towards that answer doesn't mean that it is logical.

If a person has an idea or needs an idea about something they are going to want to get advice about something. If they have an idea then they can either change the idea or enforce there idea from the different opinions. If they don't have an idea then they can get ideas from the peoples advice. That is why having multiple perspective of an opinion is good.

Giving advice to people can work because of a difference in opinion. If someone has a difference in opinion or a friend has a difference in opinion then giving advice and explaining it thoroughly can really help someone. like if someone asks a friend to give some advice to them. Then talking about precisely what they are looking for can help to expand a brooder view on how that person can help there friend.

Having a difference in opinion, to find a way to decide on different opinions, giving advice, and deciding on changing or enforcing ideas. It all has to do with how having multiple people giving advice is a good thing. though sometimes having a difference in opinion it is not perfect it is not all that bad to have different opinions. who ever asks can narrow the idea which can enforce or maybe change the outcome of the idea. They can give advice because of having a difference in opinion. All of the ways of having advice of multiple people can all help each other.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

you might just want some more advice on what your doing. Some people give more advice then others. Also more know more about it the others and anyone can know about but not know much about. You can go to anyone and ask what their opinion is on something they will give there opinion does not mean it is going to be the same as everyone else. Just by asking one person what they think is not going to help you,but by asking multiply people opinion can Hall more.

You might think when one person give advice on something it was not that good and you want to get more about it then you would go to another person and ask then. Advice is good to get before you just go out there and do it on your own. You also want to know more then about the thing your doing just by asking one person is not going to help you.

50446FC1E14D,"Have you ever went to multiple people for advice? Because if so, you are a genius. Asking advice from multiple people, may seem like a bad idea, but I assure you, it's not. Asking for advice from multiple people is a great idea because of these reasons.

When you ask for multiple peoples advice, you will get rid of biases. If you only ask one person, they may have pre-received notions about your situation, and if you try to deal with it yourself, you will have one of the biggest biases, as you're the one who is in the situation. When you ask multiple people, it gets rid of that bias, so that the decision made is not clouded by any personal experiences.

Along with getting rid of biases, it can give a new perspective. Sometimes there are things that you wouldn't think about, and other people can provide that type of view. When you are inside of a situation, it is hard to think outside of the box, especially if it is stressful situation. Without that stress, people can make level headed decisions, and bring a new perspective, which may help.

In addition, asking multiple people may take the weight off your shoulders. If other people can make a good choice, then it will take the weight off your shoulder as you wouldn't have to come up with a solution yourself.

This would help a lot of people, as they would not have to worry about the stress of picking an option.

That is why I think that asking advice from multiple people is a good idea. It gets rid of biases, gives a new perspective, and takes some of the weight off your soldiers. So the next time you are in a dilemma, just ask people for advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Seeking multiple opinion can benefit you make new friends, have good relationship with your friends and make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion.

Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you. When someone trust in you, he or she can tell you their secret about everything they have in secret. If someone trust in you he or she will know that you are a good friend. For example, if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you.

Seeking multiple opinion can make you have good relationship with someone.

Having a good relationship with someone is a good thing to do in life.

Having a good relationship with someone can make him or her get close to you . Helping your friend for example, helping him or her with his homework or something he or she needs help with , advising him or her to do the right if he or her did something wrong, being nice and respectful to everyone can also make someone have a good relationship with you.

Seeking multiple opinion allow you to make new friends. Sometime when you are making new friends you dont just have to make friends, you have to think about it .

Make a friend who respect everyone, correct you when you do something wrong and someone who is there for you because, when something happen to and you have a bad friend, he or she will not help you but, If you have a good friend, he or she will help you when you are in a bad situation. Good friends are all way there for you when you have a problem with something or someone.

A88BEC03617C,"If you were making one of the most important choices of your life wouldnt you want to make the right one?

That is why it is good to hear lots of people advice because some people could give great advice but others could give awful advice.

People's opinions could make a tremendous impact on the advice that they give you.

If someone has a very strong opinion it could be bias but if someone has a very weak opinion they likely dont care about that subject.

Someone could have a bad history with the topic of advice or just not care so they could have a very bad opinion because they dont like talking about the topic or just dont like the topic.

Lastly people could just flat out lie to you in theyre opinion and that could end up causing you to potentially make the wrong choice.

A another thing that could have a huge impact on the advice that people give you is whether or not they have experience in the topic.

If someone is very experienced in the topic that person would likely give you great advice but if someone isnt experienced and is just giving you random advice that could cause you to make the wrong decision.

People could have had a great experience with the topic which could cause them to give you a biased answer of whether or not they likes the experience they had with the topic.

The same thing goes for if someone were to have a very poor experience it could cause bias.

Finally people could just flat out lie to you about theyre experience with the topic, they could call themselves and expert but in reality they could be completely clueless and giving you horrible advice.

Lastly people could just be bad advice givers, they could have good things to tell you but not know how to explain it or tell you about it.

You need lots of advice from lots of different people in order for you to just get some good advice from people.

If someone does not like you they could purposely give you bad advice which could potentially ruin your life.

All in all I think that it is very important to get advice from different kinds of people and get it from lots of people because, one wrong decision could ruin your life and that would not be good.

When I get advice I always make sure to ask lots of people that I am friends with or my family and they always try theyre best to give me good advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
097BDC9D09D2,"Do you ever get stuck in a problem that you don't know how to fix? Many people get into situations that they cannot solve on their own. A lot of those times they would go to other people asking them for advice. They often go to more than just one person, so they know which solution will work best. After each person that they talk to, they know a little more on what to do. Asking multiple people for advice can help a person by getting more perspectives, and understandings of what to do.

When looking for advice, getting more perspectives is a good idea. If there are more views of the situation, there will be more options when deciding on a solution. People might not agree with one way of doing something, but they might agree with another. Hearing the ideas of others could change the way that the problem is thought about. Each opinion of a person has a different effect on the person in need of advice. Some opinions could be more helpful than others.

If advice is needed, a better understanding of the solutions could help when it's time to make a choice. More knowledge over the problem can be useful when finding a solution. Truly knowing what is wrong will give the person in need of advice more confidence when they are deciding what to do. They will become more open to the possibilities. For example, Generic_Name got into some trouble with her friend, and they are no longer speaking. Generic_Name doesn't know what to do, so she goes to another friend in need of advice. After she went to her friend, she realized that she know a little bit more, but the information that she had was still not enough. She went to three other friends before she understood what the problem was. Then, Generic_Name knew that she just had to talk to her friend and apologize. When the problem is understood, the solution will reveal its self.

Going to more than one person for advice can help them by getting more perspectives and understandings of what to do. If you are in a problem, seek the advice of others. Open up to possibilities, and ask for help. When there are multiple perspectives to a problem, the solution will seem more simple. If advice is needed, a better understanding of what is wrong will help find a resolution. Advice from Multiple people is the better way to solving a problem.                                                                                               ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

191D76BCC101,"Do you ever just want to do something but have no clue how to do it? Well you may look it up or you may ask other people for advice. When you ask another person for advice it is probably better than looking it up because they have the experience of it, and what happened. But, when you get advice, do you get it from just one person, or multiple? Even though it takes up more time it is better to get advice from multiple people. I believe it is better to get advice from a few different people is because one person may have done it wrong, you can compare the different options, and you can see if there way of doing things is more valid.

It is better to get multiple opinions because the one person you ask may have done it wrong. If they did it wrong and things didn't turn out well, the may try to give you advice on it but probably won't give you the exact way of doing it correctly. If you got one opinion and put it on front of you you would think it is correct because it is all you have. But then, you get three opinions and put them in front of you, and two of them are the same and one is different, it would be obvious with way is better. So, having a few choices will give you a better chance doing it correct. Afterwards, you would probably be happy that you got multiple opinions.

The second reason that it is good to get a few opinions is because you can compare the different options. Like I said you are more incline to pick one way if there was more people doing it that way. Rather than just asking one person and having no other knowledge, asking three or more people will give you a better option at it and also what not to do. Also, while comparing them and thinking of what they did right and wrong, you may realize that you may have a better way to do it. Another reason to compare is that everyone you asked may be wrong and if you compare, and ask more people, you will eventually find the correct way of doing it.

The last reason I have for this is that the more people you ask, the more valid. If you ask one person it is a fifty-fifty chance of being right or wrong. So if you ask ten people it will be more clear what the right way of doing it is. Think of a science experiment, the more times you do it, the more valid your turn out is. Just like that the more people the more valid. One you determine the one that has the most validity will probably be your way of doing it.

After the process of going through all of your options, you will most likely find the most valid way of doing whatever you are trying to do. It depends on the amount of people that you ask and how you compare different ways, maybe even making up your own way to do it. The amount of different ways to do something is almost endless. That is why I think that you should get more opinions, to see if any are wrong so you will not repeat them, compare them, and choose the most valid.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Opinions

When you need advice do you ask other for there opinions? I know I do all the time. Sometimes getting someone elses opinions helps me make a better choice. Here are reasons why seeking others opinions can help.

My first reasons is when your'e trying to make a choice or a decision you want others opinions. When you give yourself advice and it isn't enough. Going to a parent, teacher or even a friend can help you. People can give others really good advice. They can also see something from a different point of view. Which can sometimes change your mind about something or someone.

My second reason is others probably had to make choices that are similar to yours,so getting there opinion can help a ton. Also, getting one person opinion or getting none at all or just taking your own advice can't help you make a choice. Seeking multiple opinions helps me good choices that can help me now and later on. Also, some people may give you different opinions. Getting different opinions helps you think about your choices.

My last reason is you could also give someone else your honest opinion. They might need your help, because you may give really good advice. Also, if you have gone through the same problem or had to make a tough choice or decision you can give your opinion and help them through there problem.

In conclusion, I thnk getting others opinions or there piont of view can help you make better choices. Not getting any advice doesn't really help make decisions. Asking people who are close to you like your family, getting there opinion makes a difference than not getting any at all.         ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

It's my opinion

Generic_Name asks her friend, Generic_Name how to spell something for her farewell card.

He spells it incorrectly, so her friend didn't understand what the card says.

Generic_Name could have avoided this if she just asked another kid or two. The answers people give can possible be wrong.

Multiply opinion help to have a better understanding, prevent false information, and avoid lies.

It's very Important that a person has a good understanding of others opinions.

Other people might have experienced the same situation that the other person is experiencing.

It can help them come to a better conclusion and how to fix the problem.

If there's a fight between to people its better to hear both side of the story.

Theses are good ways to handle problems a person is facing.

Sometimes people can't trust just one opinion cause its not always reliable.

Some people make up answers just for the sake of answering.

Its important that the questions given aren't confusing for the person whose answering the question.

People can always say different stuff that can change a person's mind right or wrong.

So before going with one answer get one more just in case.

Its not as easy tell if someone lied without witnesses.

For instance, Generic_Name has done something bad and he blames it on his sister. But Generic_Name's brother saw what happened and tells the truth.

Another example would be a murder trial when they get witnesses to explain what they saw.

The defendants in some circumstances will lie to get themselves out of trouble.

Everyone should be careful of the information we take from others cause it could be a lie.

Understand that getting other's opinions can help greatly whether its a problem or just a question.

People don't always have the information right though like with the Generic_Name example.

But there's also the people who will lie to get there way like in a criminal case.

We still need to trust others just enough to get information.

Greater thing can happen in the future if people keep this in mind.                 ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
2DE95E7D6776,"The feeling of indecisiveness where your brain is waging war on itself, Google is giving out useless information, time is ticking, and you just wish someone was there to tell you what they think. Asking multiple people for their advice and opinion is better when making decisions. Other people offer contrasting solutions, different opinions from life experiences, and give confidence and ease of mind.

When talking to different people about your problem, each of them will conjure very different solutions. Listening to different ideas may inspire you to tweak you decision. When I had just moved into a different house, I was presented with an age old teenage dilemma: how to decorate my room? Consulting with my parents, sister, friends, and my wise pet dog, I settled on a blue comforter and yellow walls. However, when sometimes you've strained your brain but no solution has been thought up, the presented advice may end up being the one you pick. In the book

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,

Harry Potter has no idea how to contact Sirius Black. Luckily for him, his friends do. With their help, a plan was hatched with the involvement of invisible gas and breaking into the headmaster's office, all things he wouldn't have thought of himself. My grandmother's saying, ""Our brains are crazy in different ways,"" in this case, is an extremely accurate expression.

Consulting with many people gives you a broader perspective and more knowledge towards making your decision. When more people from different walks of life-whether it be age, ethnicity, or financial situation-give you advice, it allows you to realize which of their advice fits you the best. When my older brother was presented with the life deciding question of the future career path, the whole family weighed in. My grandfather, who survived the famine in China and grew up in poverty, suggested she strive for a stable and well paying office job. My aunt, a freelancer who grew up in the U.S, simply said, ""Follow your heart."" Compiling information from people who all lead very different lives allows you to see the bigger picture.

Listening to other people explain what they think allows you to have confidence in your own decision and ease self doubt, which some people experience. Whenever I have to make an important decision, I often become agitated and start doubting myself, listing reasons why I wasn't correct. Versus when advice is given from a unbiased outsider's point of view, it is often more rational and factual, rather than emotional. Yesterday, when my homework folder mysteriously disappeared, hearing my friends explain what they would do made me realize my problem wasn't as extreme as I made it out to be. The advice given to you can strengthen your decision by explaining why your choice is stronger, while adding points to why other options are weaker. A quote, this time from my little sister: ""A little confidence never hurt nobody.""

Hearing others' advice and solutions allows better decision-making. It gives room for wildly different ideas, wider perspectives, and more confidence in your own choice. So, are you going to take my word for it? Or have other people already convinced you?",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
47F7E409D879,"Did you know 4/5 people when asking for advice they ask more than 1 person to get different opinions? When we ask people for advice we tend to seek for more opinions to help us make a better choice. I will talk about why this could benefit your overall decision. For example, seeking for more opinions from a diverse selection of people could benefit you because it would give you a advantage to see pros and cons more and really do research on you major or simplistic decision, Also asking for more than one opinion would help because it would guide you to see who will support you through changes and who will not agree with them, Finally you would also have a better idea who to ask advice for for upcoming or later on major or tiny life decisions. In conclusion those reasons listed are beneficial when asking multiple people for advice.

One way that asking for more diverse opinions is beneficial is because it will show you a vast majority in pros and cons things that may be reasons for the decision but also showing the not so great differences. For example, when someone comes up to you and ask what they should do today you think of everyday activities but you think in depth of why they should do that activity for it may be exciting but draining in energy mapping in your head pros and cons. Another example on why asking more opinions from a large group is important in seeing pros and cons is because, you can envision the similarities in different situations like seeing pros and cons you also see similarities. Lastly, A reason why asking for more than one opinion is important is because you can compare unalike decisions and compare them to one another helping you to get a wider verity in decisions helping you to make the right one.

Secondly, Another reason on why it is very beneficial asking multiple people for advice is important is because it will indicate you the people who will support you through changes in appearance, attitude, etc. Initially going through changes can be hard even if they don't change a lot about you can still leave you venerable to a lot of self damage like insecurities. By asking people you will start to notice a lot or a little majority of people who asked my think of you differently as a person. Secondly, you start to see the people who would not support leaving you will the people who will stick by you through and decisions in life. Also you notice a lot of backlash from people and it may be harsh or may build you stronger but always your are left with the people who are unconditionally supportive of you. In conclusion, by asking a larger verity of people it would benefit you by making decisions is useful because it would guide you where your supportive resources are.

Lastly, A reason on why you should use the method of asking asking a large verity of people when it comes to advice is you would understand more who to turn to on decision making. An example of this all around the world written in books, religious books, themes in stories, and you may have been told this. But when you ask for an opinion on something a wise person would have told you the right thing because wise people have been through the same thing at a different point in life. By getting results by different people on opinions on what you should do may open your eyes and show you people that are open minded that have came across a struggle like you may be trying to overcome. For example, people seem to turn to god by preying. A lot of people may turn to nature to seek a opinion on a path to become happy or any emotion you want to feel. But also I have seen people turn to loved ones and old traditions. In conclusion, by seeking more then one opinion and basing your results on more opinion are helpful because they help you see who you can turn to for more advice in different period point struggles.

In conclusion, when we ask for advice we seek more than one opinion from different people. It may benefit in time because it would give you a advantage to see pros and cons more and really do research on you major or simplistic decision, Also asking for more than one opinion would help because it would guide you to see who will support you through changes and who will not agree with them, Finally you would also have a better idea who to ask advice for for upcoming or later on major or tiny life decisions.

Learning advice from school is good because everyone learns and get good grades. Do something good for school is good because when they gave you advice to do the right thing is class. For example the gym teacher gave you advice to do the right not the bad advice because if you do the bad thing you will get a bad grade and get in trouble. When we get in trouble is bad and you always have to listen when they gave us advice for you do well at your test. When we do well in our test is because the teacher was having us advice and we were paying attecion.

Friends gave us advice out side of school and inside school. When friends gave us advice inside school is because they want a better life for us. When friends gave us advice for our life is because they want us to be happy and be a better person. Also when they gave us advice like when we play sports. When we play sports the coach always have advice do win the game. When coaches gave us advice to play good and win games that teams will be come so good if the players get the advice of the coach.

7E558B4E7009,"Seeking multiple opinions is always better than only getting one. Having different people look at your problem offers new solutions others might not have thought of before. Only getting one opinion isn't reliable because that one person could be biased in one direction or might not be as experienced as others. While only asking one inexperienced person may lead to bias, multiple opinions could lead to new solutions to your problem.

Asking multiple people is better than only asking one because the one person you're asking could be inexperienced with the topic. Some people are more experienced with some topics then others. For example, some students are better at math and science then they are at English and civics. If you needed help with civics class then you shouldn't ask those students because they aren't great at civics. Asking multiple people for their advice is less risky than only asking one person who could be inexperienced with the topic.

Another reason you should ask multiple people instead of one is because they might be biased. Bias is when a person is leaning towards one side of an argument because of something personal. If you ask someone who is biased in one direction then you won't be able to hear the other side of the argument. For example, when people are called for jury duty, the government chooses people that are unbiased toward the topic. By asking multiple people for their advice and opinions, you would be able avoid bias and hear both sides of the argument.

Not only is getting multiple opinions more secure than only getting one, but getting multiple opinions could also lead to more advice and new solutions for your problem. Not everyone thinks the same, some people are sure to come up with solutions that others haven't thought of. You only get one solution by asking only one person while the more people you ask, the more solutions you have to your problem. The more solutions you have, the easier it is to solve your problem.

Seeking only one opinion is not as good as seeking multiple opinions. While the one person you're asking could be inexperienced with the topic or be biased, asking multiple people for their advice is more secure and should get you more solutions. The more solutions and advice you have, the easier it will be to solve your problem.

If the person has gotten into a lot of trouble for his dicisions,it's not really a great idea asking him/her.

Make sure the person is serious and not a joker.

D1F17C0DED14,"When you need advice, who do you go to?

If you only ask one person, then I i think that you should consider asking more people. After all, two is better than one! What harm can be done by asking more people? There is not one person that knows everything! When you ask more than one person, you can here more than one point of view, your information will be more likely to be accurate, and you will feel better about you decision.

when you need advice about something, mainly when it is something serious, you will want to hear more than one point of view. One piece of advice I hear a lot is to get a second opinion. Why do you think that is? Well, it is because it is a good piece of advice! As I said before, not one person is all knowing. even if we took all of the knowledge humans have, we would not even come close to knowing everything. with that being said, you are more likely to make a good decision if you ask more than one person. even if those people dont know everything, their combined knowledge still greater than the knowledge ether one of them posses on there own.

If need factual information, you should always consult more than one source. No one knows everything, as i have stated before, So to get more reliable information, you need to ask more than one person. say you are doing an experiment. you know that if you mess up a single thing, it could release a toxic gas. you know how to do everything except one thing. you ask one person about it. after they give you an answer, you thank them and go off to do the experiment.. you get to the part that your friend told you about and you do exactly what he said but it turns out that he was incorrect and you release the toxic gas and die. you could have potently prevented this if you had just asked a few more people.

Lastly, you will feel more confident in your decisions. If you have multiple people that agree on the decision you are planing to make, then it is more likely to be a good decision. Or say you are relatively sure about something. you ask someone if they think what you believe is true and they say yes the you feel more confident in what you know.

All in all, it is good to get a second opinion. it will help you make the right decision. after all it docent hurt to ask. So tell me, next time you need advice, will you get a second opinion?",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
2EAE515F6F39,"Multiple opinions can help people decide on what to do. When asking for an opinion you might want to ask more than one person because the person you ask might have better advice than the other person. Another reason is that people could have different personal opinions and points of view than others and their advice could help you out a lot in the future.

When you ask for someones opinion you should listen carefully to what they have to say. Some people have better advise than others. I think people should ask more than juts one or two people for advice because people may have different points of view from others and you could agree with one or more people on something. If you only listen to one persons advice them you would have not known what other people had to say. The person you did not ask could have had really good advice but you would never know because you only asked one person. When ever I need advice I ask at least three people to see what they would say and what kind of advice they would give me. I listen closely to what they say and their advice could help me later. I listen to what everyone says and I think about what could benefit me either now or in the future.

Like I said before people have their own opinions so if someone gives you advice that you do not agree with and you get upset just remember that everyone does not think exactly like you. People have their own personal opinions and they will sometimes tell you something that you do not like or want to hear . Now if someone gave you advice that you do not like do not ignore it take it as constructive criticism and listen to what they say and have a open mind about it. For example: Lets say you made some food and you add a little to much salt and your friend tells you that it is was to salty and that maybe you should have added less salt but you find the food to taste just right. Next time maybe dont add as much salt. This way you listen to your friends advice even though you disagree and if you find it alright and if they find the food better then you both dont lose nothing. And theres other ways to deal with this situation like not cooking that meal, but you decided to listen to your friends advice and in the end it all worked out. Its ok if people have different opinions then you and their advice isnt what you would like to hear but its good that you learn from them.

In conclusion when seeking advice its good to ask more than one person because everyone is different and they will tell you different things. Some of those things could be bad advice but as long as you find the good in what everyone says and not just what one person says youll find the advice your looking for.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B78A191477C9,"When I want to get advice, I don't just talk to one person. I seek multiple people's advice because they can have different viewpoints on the same topic. You can seek multiple opinions on anything from buying something to making big and important life decisions. For example, I would need multiple opinions on how to make a beautiful, delicious cake because there are so many ways and flavors to make the cake. Having no multiple opinions is like a short answer question on a test where you can type anything you want to, but possessing more than one opinion makes the decision easier similar to how a multiple choice question helps you answer a question easier.

If I wanted to buy a bike, I would seek multiple opinions from different people to find out which brand is the best and which bike is the least expensive, but with the best quality. If the majority of people that I ask says that a specific brand is the best, then I will probably buy a bike from that brand. You can use other people's viewpoints for things other than buying a bike too. Things such as choosing a college to apply to are very important. I would ask a lot of experienced people to recommend a college to go to because it is a very important decision of my life.

You can also use multiple opinions in courts with complete strangers. If there is a mystery and a detective has a suspect, the court would get witnesses. Not just one witness, but multiple witnesses if you want to make sure the witness wasn't mistaken. If most of the witnesses says that the suspect is the one who committed the crime, then the suspect is most likely the person that broke the law. Multiple opinions can be used in a lot of ways, and it isn't only used in your everyday life.

In conclusion, Seeking multiple opinions is good and important because it helps you make better decisions. Multiple opinions can help people save money on buying something or even change their lives by deciding which college to go to. People that give you their opinions don't have to be people you know or friends, they can also be witnesses in a court that you don't even know. If I were to make a big decision, I would ask lots of people for advice, and I would advise you to do it too. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
41A3FC274B69,"""Hey Generic_Name are you going to the movies today?"" asked Generic_Name. ""Hmm I don't think so I have to go talk to my sister about something"" replied Generic_Name. It was the end of the school day, and Generic_Name's sister Generic_Name was going to pick her up from school. ""Hey kiddo how was your day?"" asked Generic_Name. It was okay I guess"" answered Generic_Name. Generic_Name asked Generic_Name, ""What's wrong?"" ""Look I was wondering if I can ask you something"" said Generic_Name. ""Sure what's going on?"" replied Generic_Name. ""So I wanted to go to the movies today but, I didn't want to go because Generic_Name was going to bring her new friends and, her friends are really mean to me and I don't want to tell her"" said Generic_Name. ""Look you have to tell her friends to back off and to leave you alone"" said Generic_Name in anger. For some people it's hard to make the right choice. Sometimes they don't know what to do so they ask for advice. When asking for advice to more than one person is helpful because you can see what people have to say to you advice, you can agree to some of the advice they have to give you, and some people might know the answer to your problem because they went through this situation.

To begin with most people have different opinions to people's problems, but that's a good thing because you can ask multiple people to your own problem. You can go and ask so many people and hear what they have to say. Everyone has different opinions which is good but you know a great thing about asking for advice is that you can choice which one you would take. An example to this is a kid named Generic_Name who as dealing with a big problem so his girlfriend was cheating on him, but he really didn't know what to do about it ,because he loved her so much. So he went off to ask so many people for their opinion about this. Generic_Name heard a lot of different things, he heard that he should stay with her and forget about what she did, to leave her and never talk to her, and just to talk to her and confront her. At the end of the day he knew what choice to pick because he heard many people's opinions, and he knew the right choice. This was just by hearing them, that's why you should listen to what people have to say.

Another problem that can help you when asking for advice is you can agree and disagree to what everyone has to say. That's the best thing if you don't agree with them you can say why you don't agree with them. Also its just not going to be disagreeing and agreeing with one person but multiple people. An example to this is Generic_Name who hate's helping her bullies with her homework. She always has to help her bullies with homework and she still hasn't told anyone about this problem. One day she wanted to tell someone so she told her mom, and she said that she should tell them to leave her alone, but if she did that they wouldn't stop. So she didnt like her mom's answer so she she asked her friend, Generic_Name and she said to not do anything and leave it alone. Generic_Name didn't like that answer too. She asked her grandma and she said to tell a teacher, this was the answer she knew she needed and she took her advice a went for it. Generic_Name told on them and they left her alone, she knew she made the right choice but she was disagreeing to some of the things that didn't sound right. This a great way to get you choice by agreeing and disagreeing tell you know which one is the right choice.

The last thing is asking multiple people for advice is good because if you ask people for help they might of had this problem too. It's good to see people had the same problem as you and they can help you. A reason to this is Generic_Name who had a problem to when she had a friend talking behind her back and still hanging out with her was a issue she had. She knew she had to tell someone, she told her mom, her aunt, her grandma, and her sister. Generic_Name asked all of them and none of them had this problem expect her sister. She was taking to her what happen and how it ended. Generic_Name was happy that she knew what to do because someone went through this. So what she had to do was tell her that she doesn't wasnt a friend who lies to her and talks behind her back. She said this and never talked to her again which was said but she knew what to do because someone went thought this, it helped her a lot.

""Hey Generic_Name can I talk to you for a little bit about something"" asked Generic_Name. Generic_Name replied ""Sure what's up."" ""So your friends have been taking bad about me and I don't like that, your friends are so mean to I dont know how you like them."" said Generic_Name. ""Oh I didn't know that I thought that they like you it"" replied Generic_Name. ""Um they don't but I don't want hang out with them just you like we use to"" said Generic_Name. ""Me too I don't even like them too, thank you for telling me"" said Generic_Name. ""Yeah me too"" said Generic_Name. ""Um why did it take you so long to tell me"" asked Generic_Name. ""I needed to know how to tell you so I asked helped for many people"" answered Generic_Name. When asking for advice from multiple people is helpful that's why we should ask for help when we need it. It's okay to ask more than one person it helps a lot, just how it helped Generic_Name.       ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C8EF7048C03F,"When you're looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decision into one person's own opinion.

One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause. Your always gonna have a opportunity cost. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. including the rest of your life, your mood for the rest of the day, the improvement, or the impact. There are multiple options that can occur.

Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others people's opinion's about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if it's gonna be a bad time or a good time. After you have learned you can help out the one's in your same position or a little more different. But still can be able to help others in need. You can learn from it and help other's or you can learn from it and help yourself in the future if you ever come upon the same situation. Or even teach the one's need in teaching

One dislike I don't like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. Different people can give you different responses about your situation. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. Even picking which choice your gonna make can put more stress and pressure on you. Maybe even after picking your choice it could turn out the worst day of your life or the best. It's really hard to make the selection of which advice your gonna pick.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EA04020F5ECD,"when people ask you for advice they sometimes talk to more people than one they ask they ask for a good advice becuase if they will not have good advice they can't think about a good decision somtimes a person who have trouble in her or his life or any depression our any happiness in thier life they can't make control thier a control on them . so they get pannic sometimes they can't think what to do they don't know how to do things so that's why they from many people but when they seeks multiple opinions so they get confiused they can't select one opinion that is good for them they want to think about that but they can't do that so they ask many people for different opinions so that's good but also not good tho but so they need to figure that what they should do or what not what i think is it's ok to ask people thier opinions but we should also need to think use our mind whithout our mind we can not do any thing the opinions that are given by other people we should think about them like what are they saying what's the point is it good for us or not or if i will follow this opinion it will make trouble for me or not then u will ask your friend or a person that is so close to you if that person will say yes you will be like ok than . lets do it

!

so you do a whole long procisior for getting a one good opinion what you need to do is that ask opinions from two or three people and then if u think it's not a good opinion than think your own and then take a good decission. everyone takes thier own decission i think if you wanna ask for a opinion find a good trustful adult who really really wants to help you who will give you a better choice and then think about it if you think that she or he is right then just follow the directions for example i have a birthday party and i need to select the dresses for everyone and arrange the birthday party and i don't have enough time i am so worried and confiused i don't known what to do .

i need a help from people i asked from my friends , cousins ,family ,teachers and then i think that i have a lot of opinions so i can't choose 1 so what i did was i asked my older cousine and then we discused about that she told me in details what to do and then i managed my time and i choosed the dresses i arranged the birthday party in one week everything was so good that's how we make better chioce for our self if u can't do that at least think on your own or ask for help and ask from a good person not anyone you don't know well becuase people can play with you so we have to be carefull so i think asking an adult is more better than asking a lot of people becuase asking an adult will help you more becuase the first time i need help and i asked a lot of people and i was so confiused and i was like what is going on with me because it was my first excperience i didn't use my mind it was so bad waste of time every thing was ruined and that's why i learned something is never do anything that your parents or adult don't like here is another way to make a better choice and that is always listen to your parents and your adult because sometimes the decisions that you are making it seems like they are good but after some time you realize that it's not good for you u get in trouble and all you have face somethings so thats why do what your parents are telling you to do not what you wants to do it's ok to listen to your heart but sometimes it's not so the best way to make a better choice is listen your parents and adult 2nd is use your mind to think that it's good or bad the 3rd way is to ask someone who is an adult and such a nice and truthfull person believe in your self and your god these are the best ways to make a better choice we should always believe in your self and your parents because they will always tell you a thing that is good for you no matter what it is just think that yuor parents tell you to do that and again believe in yourself if you will everything will be good if you be feel good believe in your god becuase he will help you everywhere he is with you so these are the best way to make a good choices are these..",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
05D84C1F29D4,"How is seeking different opinions from multiple people help you make the better choice? First, asking more than one person for advice can help you choose the more benefical outcome for your future, weither it's that important or not. Second, asking your friends and family for advice could help you choose something they know you would be interested in, or like. Next, if you aren't good at choosing between multiple choices, you can ask some one after they gave you there opinion, ""why"" or ""how"", they came up with that idea. All together, these could be some of the few benefical ways to making your choice,

First off, asking more than one different person, could maybe help you decide whatever you are asking there opinion for. By stating that, everyone has different opinions, so when you're asking more than one person for help, you aren't just getting the same opinions over and over again, you are getting a variety of choices to choose from. But, while making your decisions, you can see which choices you gave everyone were choosen the most, and decide weither you want to pick that decision or not. All in all, asking others for there personal advice, can help you decide weither you like the idea of that being what you pick or not.

Nextly, another good way to determine what you want to choose is to ask your friends, and family. Personally, when I need good advice I go to my friends, and family for help. That's because, they know me the best, and they only want what's best for me. This also helps because, it's easy to talk to some one you know and trust, rather than asking some one you barley know for advice. To conclude this paragraph, one of the best ways to ask for advice is through friends, and family. You can always count on them to be there, they know you the best, and they only want what's best for you. So, when talking to some one you trust, can also help you trust there opinion.

The next thing that you can do and will help you, is ask them ""why"" they chose that answer or, ""how"" they did. This helps so that you can better understand, and get a little back ground information on why they made that decision. It makes it so that you aren't questioning why did they choose that anwser, how did they come down to that becoming something they would choose for themselves or you, and so you're not questioning if you should've picked that answer or not. All in all, since you're asking some one why they choose that, you can better understand how, or understand how they think and process answers for there outcome, so that in the future you can understand more about making decisions on your own instead of asking others.

In conclusion, from asking others such as family memebers to friends, how they have decided on that answer. Can help you make a more benefical outcome for your future. By knowing, that they only want what's best for you, that can help make you more confidence in what they chose, so that you can understand how they might process and why that's the best choice for you. All together, all this information will help you better understand how to choose what's best for you, so that in the future when you have to make harder chooses on your own you know how to do so.     ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
0E8CB55193E3,"When it comes to advice it's always good to have more than one persons opinion. Everyone thinks differently and have different perspectives with different things. Some people may agree with you and others may not which it's always good to see who agrees with you and who doesn't. It can always help you out with what you want to do and what you don't want or shouldn't do.

Many people look at things differently so you're obviously not going to agree on everything with the person. But when it comes to advice it can get difficult on who you should agree with. For example lets say you want to set a goal for yourself like wanting to lose weight. You may think just by not eating any junk food and start eating healthier would solve the problem don't get me wrong it may help, but lets say you're not too sure so you ask a friend for advice. In that case it's good to ask more than one person to see what you want to do which should always be something you think is best for you.

Don't stress about other peoples opinions if they disagree with you and you know that it's something you want to do and look forward on doing go ahead and go for it. You shouldn't do something that doesn't make you happy do something you enjoy, something that make you feel good about yourself because at the end of the day it's not always about what people think if not what you enjoy doing and feel good about.

You basically get the point on what I am trying to say is yes it's good asking for advice but don't be that type of person who ask for advice and never ends up doing it. Yeah I understand if it's something you're not interstead in doing but if it's more than one person who you asked advice for and never end up doing anything. Then what was the whole point on asking for advice if you weren't going to do anything.

Just do something you enjoy and like I said everyone may have agreements and disagreements but do something which you know is the best for you and not something you feel obligated to do if not what makes you feel good about yourself doing.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
C23535D7A352,"Did you know that eight out of ten people make the wrong decision because they only asked one person for their opinion. I think it is better to ask more than one person so you can get a different opinion from everyone, make sure the decision is right for you, and to here there reason why they agree with me.

My first reason to why I agree that you should get more than one opinion on a decision is that you can get a different opinion from everyone. If you just ask one person then that will only give you one opinion to make a decision the decision could be life changing and you dont want to make a big decision off of one opinion. For example you're deciding whether you should have a bay before you get married or after you get married and settled in. You ask one person and that person says before and you have the baby because you are a good listener and boom the guy you got pregnant with leaves if you would have had the baby after you got married it would have so much more harder for him to leave then when you're not married. If you wanna make the right decisions in life you should ask more than one person for there opinion.

Secondly you want to make sure the decision is right for you. If you ask a person there opinion they will tell you what they think but just because that particular person says yes i would get a pet tiger but in reality me and you both know what the right decision is like tell me and be honest would you really go and by a pet tiger? OK let me get back on track like I said before you dont want to just ask one person. another reason you wont to make sure it's right is to think about your self in the moment to you don't want to just decide something and later on in life regret it. Lets say you go and get a sleeve witch is a tattoo that covers your whole arm and then you want to be receptionist they won't accept your application because your tattoo is in an open spot where everyone can see it there are certain standards you have to be held up to and that is not one of them.

Last but not least to hear why or why not they agree with me. I would like to hear why or why not they agree with me because they have to have a good reason to why or why not they agree with me. I would like to know why they agree or disagree with me to se whether i could change it a little to make it make more sense. Another reason I would like to know why they agree or disagree is to know why it doesn't make sense or makes sense to them to see what we agree on and what we disagree on. For example you say ""Do you think it should be illegal to dump oil into the sea?"" and the other person says no you would want to know what they said no.

In conclusion these where my three reasons/opinions to why you should ask other people for there opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
D935E6EB5427,"Screaming and the sounds of objects shattering is what Generic_Name hears on a daily basis in her house. Usually its because of a small disagreement between her parents and gradually gets more intense but recently its been because of her. Generic_Name and Generic_Name are getting a divorce and have recently been arguing about who was going to keep Generic_Name because nobody wanted the responsibility. Since Generic_Name is 13 years old, she has the option of either staying with one of her parents or being put up for adoption. She wakes up one morning for school, trying not to make a sound because she doesnt want her parents waking up and starting her day of with screaming. When she manages to get out the house she puts a fake smile on and carries on her day. Throughout it, she asks her best friend, who was the only one who new about the situation, for her opinion on it. Generic_Name gives her thoughts but doesnt seem to care much about it. Generic_Name doesnt bother asking anybody else. Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice can make a better choice because someone might have asked for the same advice before, there might be someone with more knowledge about it, and there is less stress on yourself on making a decision all on your own.

One reason you should ask for for multiple advice is because someone might have asked for the same advice before. For instance, Generic_Name is going through a breakup and she doesnt know what to do. She asks multiple people for their advice and a couple of them tell her they have been through the same thing then they give her their opinion on what they have done in the past. Since she asked more than one person for advice, she got results. Another example, when I was getting a pet for my birthday I had the choice of either getting a dog or a cat. I asked all my friends for their opinion about it and they all gave me the pro's and con's about each one since most of them had the same situation happen to them before. I ended up getting a cat because I was told it would be less expensive, less work to care for it, but be more fun to have. Since I got many opinions on my advice, I made the best decision and got better results.

Secondly, you should ask for multiple opinions for advice because there might be someone with more knowledge about it. For instance, Generic_Name is in an abusive relationship and her boyfriend cannot handle his anger so he takes it out on her and whenever she goes to work she always has to wear pants and a long sleeved shirt to hide her scars and bruises. She finally tells her co-workers about her situation, asks for their opinions and all of them tell her it isn't healthy to be in that relationship. She broke up with him and things started getting better from then on. Because she asked so many people about it and they seemed to know much more than she did, her life was much better and safer. Another example, when Generic_Name was asking a question on a math problem she asked one person for help and they gave her an answer but when she asked the teacher about it, she got the question wrong. She then on started asking multiple people for answers on her math homework and most of them would give her the right answers. Since other people had better knowledge than her, she got her math homework answers correct.

Lastly, you should ask multiple people for their advice because it would be less stress on yourself for making a choice on your own. For instance, Generic_Name has been very depressed lately and is deciding if she should run away. She tells her friends at school and they give all their attention on her and tell her that it isnt right so she should stay. It helps Generic_Name a lot since she is not the only with the weight of that decision and she decides to stay because she trusts her friends. Eventually things turn around for her and she is back to her normal, happy self. Since she didnt have all that weight of her decision all to herself, she didnt feel as stressed. Another example, when Generic_Name's parents were getting a divorce she had to decide whether to live with her mom or dad. Its stressful enough that she has to choose between two people she loves. She asks multiple friends and some of her counselors about what she should do and each one of them help her out. Since she is getting help from so many people she feels less stressed about her decision making. Getting multiple opinions on something could make decision making less stressful.

Generic_Name comes home one one day after school and as soon as she walks in she sees books being thrown at her dad from her mom. Generic_Name quickly shuts the door, grabs her bike and heads to the mall. She sees her friend group at the mall and joins in. They're exited to see her and they hang out. Generic_Name is debating whether to tell her friends about whats happening at her house. She finally gathers up the courage and asks her friends about it. They seem shocked at first because they didnt know about it, other than Generic_Name, but they start telling her about their opinions on it. One of her friends went through something similar and tell Generic_Name what she did and how it will have a better outcome. all her friends say that she should choose to be with another family because it will have a better outcome. Generic_Name feels less stressed about the situation since shes not the only one having to choose a choice all by herself and she trusts them about it because they have more knowledge about it. After spending her whole afternoon at the mall, she rides her bike home. She enters her house and still sees her parents arguing. She takes a deep breath and interrupts them. She tells them about her decision. 3 years later Generic_Name is living in a house that never has anybody arguing and has two new parents that love her.

E85D576C9EA2,"When faced with a difficult task or decision its beneficial to ask for advice,but sometimes asking for help does more harm than good or leaves you with more questions than you had before. This is why when seeking advice you should always be careful,because you can't always know if the person your asking really knows what they are talking about. It isn't always lack of knowledge though it can be that that person has a bias towards one particular subject or that they want to purposefully spread misinformation. To protect yourself against this you need ask as many people as possibly in order to widen your perspective and ultimately make the best chose possible.

Firstly,asking multiple people for help on a subject is the best and only way to about seeking advice. If the first pereson you asked is off on their information you will quickly figure that out if the next people's advice is wildly different from that of the first,but this isn't always the case. For example if you were to ask all your friends if you should stay up all night playing video games with them chances are that they would say yes. Now if you ask a doctor or your parents the same question chances are that they would say no and they'd probably be correct. The point is that the majority is not always in the right a lot of the time the minority is correct so it is crucial to try to hear the perspective of different kinds of people such as different ages or ethnicity. So you do not make a mistake in your decision.

An example of a time when i made a mistake in asking advice was when i asked my friend if i should preorder a video game or not. Due to the fact that he was a huge fan of the company who made the game he couldn't say enough about how good it was going to be and all the new and innovative features. Not realizing that i should have done my research and ask around a little bit more I pulled the trigger and preordered the game. Days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months when it finally gets released. I excitedly unpacked the game when I realize that its nothing like my friend hyped it up to be as. It was a 70$ mistake but it taught me an important lesson to always be on the look out for bias.

Bias is when are person has a predisposed opinion on a subject for example my dad is in the Navy so if you were to ask whether or not navy

(The college Football team)

would beat Army he would definitely tell you Navy would win. So when asking for advice it is important that you try to get information from people with the least amount bias.

The worst kind of advice you can get and sometimes not the most obviously wrong is that from people that want to purposefully lead you down the wrong path. This kind of advice is the worst due to the fact that a lot of the time it can get you in the worst trouble. It is most commonly seen online in the form of tabloids or fake news articles. It's also one of the most easily taken care of by simply not looking online for advice or making sure you know who exactly your seeking advice from.

In conclusion seeking advice is a great way to widen your point of view but it's important to be knowledgeable of who your asking so you don't end up making a costly mistake.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
AEFDD857A5D9,"People, now in days ask more than one person for advice, they like to hear more than one opinion on that one situation. People can sometimes find more outcomes than they anticipated. Finding more than one solution can be helpful for them to make the right decision. Other people can give them an advice that could be good for them but the person who asked may not like their response. People can often ask their friends and family for advice so that they can find a solution that best fits their interest, also seem to like when they express their thoughts to them and explain why they think that opinion comes to the best for that person. These opinions can help people because, it gives them a different way at looking at things, helps them make better choices, and gives them a better thought of what they are being told to that one person to see what is best for he/she.

Therefore, people may be comfortable with seeing different types of perspectives to see if a good outcome could come out from that one option. People can often express their thoughts differently and help that one person understand the information and make a good deed with it. It is a good thing when you seek different types of perspectives because they could often help you with more than one problem. Although, different perspectives could lead to making bad choices it is still good to think about them and process them correctly to see what is best. Being influenced in different types of ways could be good to tell what kind of perspective other people are seeking.

However, asking more than one person for advice is a good thing. Why? You may ask. Well because, it could lead to a great outcome and it can help they person have a great benefit on fixing that issue. Good choices can only be controlled by one person and that one person is yourself no one can control you to do things you are not sure of. This is why when you ask more than one person for advice is good and u are the only who can control how you use that certain type of information. More than one opinion is good so that they can make the best decision on the problem they are going through.

For example, when you are receiving the information you try to use it at your best interest. In order to do that you have to understand exactly what they are telling you and use the information correctly because sometimes you may not understand the information and end up with a very bad outcome. When receiving information/ opinion from others is something that is great because they are helping you so that you can solve your problem he best way they think you can using their tectonics. When you do not understand the information then maybe they could explain it differently. Thinking thoroughly on their opinion is good because you are able to see if it truly benefits you.

In conclusion, having multiple opinions can help introduce better choices for them and provide a way better outcome for them. Plenty of choices could lead to something good or something bad, but it never hurts more to just hear a couple opinions and to tell if it is good for you or not. Hearing from plenty different perspectives is good as well could really help you on some future issues. Different thoughts on things is a great way to express your feelings on things and the way you look at them. More than one solution is a great way to see if it truly benefits you.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5E3C351AB579,"Have you ever asked for someones opinion and they give you a choice that's bad and good and what you chose turns out very well or very wrong? well it happens to everyone, and it doesnt stop you in the world. You seek opinions from multiple people because it gives you feed back on the right and the wrong.

When you ask for someones opinion it either gives you a right choice or a wrong one meaning you either chose the one that gets you nowhere, or you chose the one that gives you hope, happiness, and a future. We decide on what we want, and those opinions they are there to help us chose if we want the good things or the bad thing in life. We ask for opinions to help us not just for anything but for the important things in life, opinions helps us make a big or small decisions that could change a lot. When you ask for someone opinion you may get a bad answer, and that's okay it does not mean your gonna chose wrong we make mistakes and most arent life changing, but you have to make sure you know what you wanna do if something goes wrong, opinions help you grow and learn from everything thats why they are great for you when you really need it. We must make a decision for ourselves if we wanna change the world to the point where we learn from opinions and grow.

Opinions are feedback of a right and a wrong, you tell someone "" hey can I have your opinion on something"" and they tell you what you need, and that helps lots of people because it helps them hear what they need to hear. Another way it helps you make the right choice is it offers satisfaction, someone could not be satisfied with what they chose so they ask for help from someone else which calms them and gives them time to think about the decisions that they could make. Big opinions form someone could impact your life and your future leaving you happy or devastated which is why you get the opinion and make it a choice for yourself you don't have to rush into anything and agree with everything they say take your time and understand everything and think things through. When someone is trying to get you to make the choice they want you to make then it could go wrong. Opinion is when you get feedback and make the choice for yourself and make it a good one because opinions are going to help you make good choices in life.

When asking for someones opinion it can make you respect them or them respect you it could be either way, but when someone respects what your doing there feedback could be something to can make you accomplished, strong, and even happy because people want there opinions to matter in your life and that could make you do the right thing when coming down to making a decision on anything. They help you grow more than you would think, it makes you tolerate what someone thinks over what you think, being someone who want to accomplish something you have to grow into something you might not like meaning you have to deal with what someone thinks when it comes to something you want or need, you cant go in somewhere and tell someone '' no '', without even trying their idea. The way you respond to someone tying to give you their opinion on something impacts you a lot they might be telling you something that could change your perspective on everything.

So what I am trying to say is when you seek for multiple opinions from different people you get a right or a wrong, which is giving you a choice to do the right thing instead of the opposite. Opinions give you a chance to grow, even overcome your fears of not doing the right thing in the world, you get a chance to do the right thing and you should take that chance its your choice no one else which is why you take time, and think things through. This is why seeking opinions from multiple people make you do right things because it is you who take their opinion to heart and does good with it.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
62B435DCB587,"Even in the age of modern technology, where we are more informed than ever before, people feel the need to talk to more than one person for advice. We are faced with important choices daily, choices that we can't decide by ourselves. As previously stated, more opinions produce a better solution. Seeking more people's advice is much more helpful as opposed to just one's, because those who still feel uninformed can get a better opinion, receive criticism, and avoid bias.

Often times, you and your friend don't know the answer to something. Whether it be a math problem, or what to cook for dinner. Asking more people for their advice gives you new suggestions, and makes you consider choices that you haven't thought of before. For example, I wanted to get into sports, but my friend and I didn't think there was anything that would suit me. We were certain that we had thought of everything. Fortunately, a classmate recommended ice skating for me, and I have been doing it for several months now. I never thought that I would get into ice skating, yet now I frequently visit the local ice arena with my friends. It's hard to think of every possibility, so a third, fourth, fifth, or even a hundredth opinion, can give you a better solution that you never considered before.

Going back to the chance that two people could still be unsure of their solutions, the two opinions could either clash or agree on the same thing. More opinions will either reassure or criticize an idea, providing important feedback that is crucial to making the best choice possible. In my experience, I have disagreed with my friend on what I should dress up as for Halloween. As non-important as it sounds, I still wanted to make the most beneficial choice. So, I went to more people for advice, and they agreed with my friend's idea. I knew that if many people agreed on something, it was most likely a better choice for me. Overall, criticism is necessary in making a decision, and multiple opinions will surely deliver that to you.

Absolutely no one is completely free of bias, and a single opinion from someone might not always be the most honest one. Bias matters; if your friend said your haircut was nice just to be polite, you have the potential to be walking around with a really bad hairstyle. Or, if a friend told you to vote for a candidate just because they like them, you could end up voting for someone who doesn't fit your criteria. You always want to get advice from someone else, to steer clear of dishonest opinions. In conclusion, multiple opinions give you a higher possibility of eliminating bias, because there's always a chance that the next person will be more honest than the first.

In order to make a better choice, you should always ask for more than one person's opinion. That way, you can get a solution you didn't think of yet. You could receive thoughtful feedback for a solution you're unsure of.

And, you could get very honest advice, which might hurt, but would also be very important in your decision-making. To sum it all up, seeking advice from more than one person helps you make a better choice, by giving solutions you haven't thought of, getting feedback on ideas, and avoiding bias.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
B5AFFE1A4431,"Say you have a altercation with someone and you need advise, wouldnt you want to go to multiple people? I feel like most people go to many different people for advise because you may ask one person for advise but dont feel like what they said is true so you ask other people. Many people in this world have different opinions on everything. But thats okay because its good to hear opinions from other people because there opinion matters just like yours. I personally go to many people for advise because I like to hear more than just one persons point of view. If I only was to get advise from one person and I do it and then something goes wrong ima feel hurt because I didnt ask many people.

Make sure when you ask people for advise that its someone you can trust and not just someone you know is gonna give you bad advise because you had the audacity to come to them and ask them for there prospective just because you trusted them. I would prefer going to a close family member, close friend , teacher, etc. that you know would give there best advise possible. So for example one day I was in New Jersey and my cousin before he passed away he wanted to see me before I had left to go home back to Virginia but then I also found out that my best friend who I went to school with wanted to meet up with me that exact same day and I didnt know what to do. I really wanted to see my cousin but I wanted to see my best friend too. So I had talked to my dad, Grandma and grandpa three people I really trust and they gave me good advise on what to do. They told me that I should go with my cousin because he hasnt seen me in years ever since I was a baby. So I got in contact with my best friend and asked if we could do it another day and he agreed. So then I ended up going with my cousin and it was amazing spending quality time with him.

Asking for advise from variety of people really goes a long way and it could possibly have an outcome with you choosing the best decision for yourself. Its a 50% change of you choosing the right decision you wont always choose the best choice but at least you know for next time. I remember what my cousin always told me that you should always ask for advise even if you think you dont need it because you might regret it if you dont. Even if you dont like to hear others people opinions, which some people dont at least give it a try you might just change your mind.

It also helps you have less stress because your getting help from multiple people.

Many people get stressed out or angry when they dont know what to do. Which is a bad thing because you shouldnt stress out so much over it when you have people out there that you could talk to. There are many other ways that getting advise from other people can be helpful but these are just a few. Always make sure that you take someones advise if you trust them because it could possibly lead to a positive outcome. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
30F141B991EC,"In life, we all have to make decisions. Everyday choices, like deciding what shirt to wear or what to eat for lunch, generally do not have a huge impact or require much consideration. However, a time will come when you have to make a difficult decision that could affect many things in your life. In these situations, people tend to turn to their friends and family for advice. Before making the final decision, it is best to collect the opinions of multiple people. Seeking advice from more than one person will benefit you as everyone has different experiences and opinions, and you will learn the pros and cons of different views.

The first reason you should talk to different people before making an important decision is everybody has a different experiences an opinions. For example, if you are deciding where you want to go to collage and you ask your uncle, a James Madison University graduate, where he thinks you should go, he will most likely try to convince you that JMU is the best option. However, if you ask your aunt, a University of Virginia graduate, she will probably give reasons why you should attended UVA and not JMU.

It is important to talk to multiple people so you can better understand different perspectives and experiences.

The second reason getting advice from multiple people is helpful is you can understand both the pros and cons of your options. People are biased because of their experiences, and this can lead them to tell you the wonderful things about their opinions and the horrible things about otherÃÂ´s ideas. If you only ask one person for advice, you will only get half an opinion. This will leave you as misinformed as an inexperienced child. Collecting advice from many people allows you to hear positive and negative points about your choices.

All in all, seeking advice from multiple people can help you when making a challenging decision because you will receive opinions that allow you to view different experiences and you can see the pros and cons of your options. It will give you more knowledge about your decision and help you feel more comfortable with your final decision. If you are facing a challenging choice and turn to your loved ones for advice, be sure to ask a few of them!",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
29DD86A89693,"when asking multiple people for advice I think of cooking, you ask people to try it if you think it needs something or if it needs to be cooked longer. Asking multiple people for advice is good because you have options an outsider opinion or perspective. some examples of this are.

Asking multiple people for advice is good because you can get perspective, an example of this is shown in the office TV show , ""Michael"" (Steve Carell) is always asking everyone for advice. then he asks is friend and finally gets some good advice and looks at the perspective and then realizes what to do.

Asking multiple people for advice is good because you can get a outsider opinion , an example of this is shown in parks and rec TV show , ""Leslie Knope"" (Amy Polar) wants to build a park but doesnt want to wait. so she ask her friends first and they say just to wait. so she goes to ask and outsider ""Mark Brandaiwits""

in city planing what to do and she take his advice. for witch is just cut the tape and build a park. so it goes to show that an outsider can be good.

Asking multiple people for advice is good because you have options, an example of this is can be shown in school while writing an essay. you ask your friends if you should add more or take less off , you ask the teacher if the editing is good or if you should add commas or periods. then you can decide from those options because you asked multiple people for advice. and you most likely end up with two to three good options to pick from.

so in the end asking more than one person for advice is good because you learn all these different stragaties to solve problems. and it can even help you develop an open mindset to options and just in general. so next time your stuck or need advice ask at least three people a friend, a teacher an a outsider becasue those three will give you some pretty good advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
6A9E327A5D72,"Most times when people are put in a difficult situation they go to others for help and advice. Others opinions and comments can effect the way a person deals or handles a situation dirasticly. When people are put in tight situations and they dont know what to do they'd piggy back of of anyone who has any idea of whats going on. Sometimes the person giving the advice will have the chance to voice their opinion that said person might not like yet, they're put in a corner from not having another s opinion which could've been better in the situation and would've probably have a better outcome.

For example, when it comes to break ups theres a lot to be said about it. How to fix it, how to ignore him or her, and even how to bounce back from it. There are just times when people just want to know that they'll be okay so they go to others for help and advice. Most times having the validation from someone else helps but, people cant just take one persons word and swear by it. They have to gather more information about a subject before they can really grasp what people are trying to say. Just like school you cant just take information of the internet or from a friend and believe that and only that, you have to take steps and ask multiple questions and multiple people in order to gather the information you're looking for to see if its factual or not.

Also, seeking advice from multiply people is like having a pro's and con's list read to you with information to back it up. Where one person might think its good to do one thing but, someone else thinks its a terrible thing to do. Then the person deciding could have a clear understanding of both sides of the argument and that could make the decision a lot easier. By getting all information good and bad together they can focus on whichever decision that was most talked about good or bad and see if they agree with it. Sometimes its good to know both sides of the argument to get a better understanding of the situation. So if in the future they'll know what to do and what not to do.

Next, giving someone information that could help them differ from right to wrong is great because, some people dont know right from wrong even at an older age. Yet, most people just dont care about right and wrong they do what they wish to. By giving someone the right advice it could help them stay on the right tacks in life. Giving advice can be a good thing because by giving advice you give someone wisdom and by giving them wisdom its helping them make the right choice. Making the right choice in life is important especially when it comes to children because if they make a wrong choice it could jeopardize their future. When they're an adult and they make a mistake they can face jail time.

In conclusion, getting advice from others can help a person out a lot and have them not go through the struggle and hassle of trying to figure out whats right or wrong. By just understanding both sides of the argument someone can better grasp the real meaning behind of whats going on and, could make a better decision then what they were going to make. Just by having multiple people share their opinions it could make someones life a bit easier. When a person ask for help its always good to express the good and the bad to help them figure which road to take. As you get older it will be more important to make good choices so people should start now. Thats why it is always good to have not one but a variety of choices to choose from when asking for advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
71EF8337424C,"Asking others for their opinion can be very helpfull and give a new insight as to what is going on. When doing a task you are given you normally have a pretty good idea of what is going on and the direction you want to go. But, it never hurts to hear the opinions of others because they may have a great idea you never would have thought of. This will only benefit you and can help you improve what you are working on in the future.

This is why companies hire many workers because having more people brings in new ideas and more thought process on things they are working on and trying to acomplish. For example the president doesnt just work by himself, he has many people to give him ideas and ask what needs to be done. These people are the Vice President and his cabinet and without them the president would have to do everything by him self. Another reason it may be good to get opinions from others is so that things may be less sided. For example in our country the legeslative branch is a bipolar form of congress meaning that there are two houses. The House of Representatives and the Senate. No law can be passed if it doesnt get a majority in both of them. This sets things up so that many people want that law to be passed so it benefits mny people. The same thing goes for a project or a paper. Asking others what they think will give more ideas and other views or opinions that may be better than the current ones you have so that you can get more thing acomplished, and lead to other great ideas in the future.

Have you ever thought of how the telephone, the lightbulb, tha car and many other revolutionary inventions have been created? Do you think somebody just woke up one morning, had some bacon and made those? The answer is no. It takes a long time with many opinions and ideas to create great inventions such as those. For example the creator of the lightbulb Thomas Eddison saw that many were working on the lightbulb but could not find much success. But Thomas Eddison did because even though he himslef was a genius he looked at what others were doing, and what others had done in the past, used some of there ideas that had some success and along with some help from one of his Co-workers he created the lightbulb which completley changed the world forever. After that others looked at his succes and kept improving it to the lightbulb we all use today. The same thing then happened with the creator of the telephone. He and his co-worker worked with eachother and gave there best ideas as to what they thought would work best and tested it many times. After working hard for a long time of working together and improving it it finally worked. After many revisions from others of the original one we have the phone that many Americans have in there pockets today that you no longer need to have hooked into a wall in order to call someone. You can be wherever you want, whenever you want to call somebody and tht is truly amazing. This would not be possible though without the opions and ideas of many others. So why not just ask someone for help?

It doesnt take very long to go ask a parent or call a freind up and ask for them to read and revise a paper or assignment you have. For example there have been many times were I am done with a paper but without the help from somebody else I have summited it and later found out that there were many errors or things I could have done better on in the paper. This impacted my grade and could have been resolved if I had just gone downstairs to ask my dad to take 10 minutes to read over it. My father is also a more expirenced writer than I am so it helped to have him revise my paper. I also learned what and what not to do in my writing in the future which has helped me greatly. Now I continue to have someone look over my work because it doesnt hurt me to have another person looking over it and can ony benefit me and give me new ideas. I then use those ideas and keeep building on them like the greatest inventors and leaders have to keep improving my writing and other assignments that I need to do.

Even the smartest of us like the President and Thomas Eddison have someone that helps and gives them a second opinion so why shouldnt you? So next time you go to turn in a paper for English class just take a second and ask somebody to help you out. It has benefited me in school and outside of school and I know it will help you aswell. It cant hurt and it will help you learn from your mistakes to gain more knowledge at whatever you are doing and will help you become a better writer in the future. ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
CC68BA9DCB2F,"Asking alot of people for advice is always a great idea. Since you don't know whether the advice is good or not, its better to listen to different opinions from different people, in order to make better decisions.

For example, in four year i'll be going to college.When i'm choosing which college to go to, I will ask several people for advice. I'll ask my mom and dad to see how much money we have. Asking them can help me choose college that are not so expensive. Then i'll ask my siblings what they did after high school. One of them is planning to attend SCHOOL_NAME soon, and he told me that is a really good college for studying law. From hearing that, I might add SCHOOL_NAME to my list. Finally I'll ask my counselor where I should go, since she knows what my strength are and what my weakness are. She can suggest which college suits me the best. Hearing those advice from different people can help me choose the best college to attend.

After I enrolled in college, I will ask my parents for advice. They told me in college, studying is way more important than socializing. They also warned me to be careful and surround myself with people that will bring positive change in my life. After hearing from them, I asked my friends what they would do. They told me they would party all night and drink alcohol. Comparing my parents advice with my friends, obviously, my parent's advice are much better. It's always better to ask more people than one so you don't make a mistake.

2CFF8146A4BC,"Why multiple viewpoints are better than one

Do you want to know the best way to get help and make the best choice for yourself? All you need to do is get viewpoints from multiple people, and ask for their differing opinions. Why is this the best thing for you to do? Today I will explain why and hopefully sway you so you can do this in the future, and make the best out of the people around you.

Getting multiple opinion is a good thing. Why? First of all, it lets you get the ideas of others. All people will most certainly not have the same ideas, so you can see what other people have to say about things. You might be sided with one persons idea, then after being able to view other peoples idea, you might shift your viewpoints. This can be a good thing because you might not always have the best, or even the right idea for yourself. Viewing other peoples ideas and thinking about them can cause you to think about more than just one idea, so you can make the best out of others ideas. This can help you make good choices because it allows you to see multiple angles, not just one.

It can be beneficial to you when you ask for different peoples advice. It can strengthen your ability to view all parts of the situation, which leads the ability to make the best possible choice you can make, in any given situation. Also, some people might have more experience with the sort of situation you are in. For example, a person that is 15 might not have that good of advice for, let's say, parenting. Their advice is not valid because they have no experience. However, going to someone else, like a person in their thirties to forties, would have a much better advice that would help you in the situation, because they have had at least five to ten years of experience behind them.

I know that getting advice from more than one person is one of the best things you can do, is because it have done it in my life, and i have had some rewarding benefits. I had to do a project for school, where I had to make a model that displayed what I had learned in that unit. I did not really know what I was going to do, so I asked my parents. They helped me come up with an idea, but the rest was up to me. I then came to ask my older friend, who had done this project before. He helped me come up with how I was going to make it, and display it with confidence to the class. When all was said and done, I got an A on the project. Afterward, I pondered what I did in order to get the good grade. I remembered that I had sought the opinion and ideas of 3 different people, and I had done the very best I could have done. In the future, I would remember that project, and how rewarding it was to get help from multiple people.

Why is getting help from multiple people the best thing you can do? I helps you make the best possible choice, you can see different peoples views and ideas, and it strengthens your ability to see all sides of the situation, whatever it may be. I hope that in the future, you will think to seek others ideas and opinions. I hope that you will be able to make the best choice, and that you can get rewarded for doing so. Remember, multiple viewpoints are better than one.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

I think that asking more then one person for help is a good thing, because if lets say for example one person says that blue is the best color, another person might say red is the best color.

I had a friend who came to me and asked me for advice about dating, one person said let them do all the talking, but I said you need to talk to them too it cant just be them, their not going to find you interesting and their going to think you are boring. She went with my idea, if she had listened to her then the date wouldn't have gone so well. That is some of the reasons why to talk to other people.

Did you know that people told Ariana to stop singing, but she listened to her friends and sang. It is up to you who you listen to, but just remember that their not always correct. If your parents friends told you Mom to dump your Dad, and she listened then you wouldn't be born. The choices you make now will affect you in the future, whether a not it's what you eat or who you breakup with. You need to hear other people out, I know you don't want to hear this but your best friend is not always right. Your Mom or your Dad isn't always right ether, their just not. We all are humans, we all make mistakes some times, its just how we are. You need to hear other people out, because not everyone is correct.

Did you know that the choices you make now will affect you in the future. If one of your friends told you to jump off a bridge, would you? What if your other friend is saying not to jump off the bridge, who would you listen to? I think you would choose the friend who is saying not to jump off. We all are humans, not all of us are good at telling people good advice. We all have done stupid things in are life, like do things that are friends told us to do, and we know its a stupid idea, yet we do it anyways. Even the smartest people in the world make mistakes. Even the person that says good advice is still wrong sometimes. Choose wisely who you listen to, because they are human to.

Did you know that your teachers have made mistakes? They have trust me, you need to choose who to take advice from. When you are thinking who to listen to, think of what friends they hang around, or what they do in class or how they act at work. If you know that a person has bad friends and usually get in trouble at work, then would you take their advice? I don't think you would, or would you listen to a person who acts nice in work always does what their supposed to. I'm almost 90% positive you would choose the second person. It is nothing personal when someone chooses to listen to another person they just thought that there idea was better in that thing their going through. Just remember who to listen to.

Did you know that every single person has done something stupid, like Einstein. If your still having trouble with choosing who to listen to then see how they act. If your still having trouble then see what there grades are like in school. You could also see how they treat other people, because if your trying to make a choice of what to say to a person, and the person you ask for hep, and the person's mean well see how thats going to go. If the persons mean then don't you think that there answer would be mean to? I think it would be mean, if you are mad at someone and you still want to be friends with them, and you go to a mean person to help you, don't you think their going to say something like oh forget them, or say "" Tell them their stupid!"" or something. It all depends who you ask. I think you should ask for more then one persons advice because you don't know if they'er right, people have different thoughts of the thing that is going on, and we all make mistakes, we're all human. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B185CAA596E4,"Have you ever asked anyone for help or advice? Most likely you have. How many people did you ask? Think back, and how many people did you really ask? When asking around for advice, it is sometimes helpful to ask multiple people. Asking only a few people for advice on a topic, sometimes it isn't very beneficial to your cause. There are many reasons why asking more than just one or two people for their advice is beneficial for you such as getting more opinions, stringing ideas together, and reflecting ideas. I think that asking many people for advice is very helpful.

One reason that asking multiple people for advice is helpful is that it is easy is for getting more opinions. This is a reason that can help because you can compare multiple ideas. If you have multiple opinions and statements, you can compare them, making the the original question or problems solution become more solid, and set in stone. Getting more opinions is also better because a thought that you have originally, could be one hundred percent different, or more unique than what ten other people think. This reflects back to comparing ideas because people have different minds. Just because you think one thing, doesn't mean that other people that you ask are going to think the same way, and one person you ask isn't going to think the exact same thing as three other people that you ask. This is one reason why asking multiple people for advice is more beneficial than just asking one.

The next reason why asking many people for advice instead of just one, is that you can string ideas together. In a way, this reason kind of relates to the first, with the fact that it is using multiple ideas to form one really solid one. However, when receiving many ideas to help your predicament, people can leave out some crucial points. For this reason, the other pupils that you ask could help fill in the key points that anybody else missed. The opposite way works as well. People that you ask could fix, or improve your initial point, or opinion. The point of this, is stringing the points together. You can bounce the ideas off of each other, and make one very strong, and crucial solution for your situation. This is another reason why asking multiple people for their opinion can help you out more.

As stated earlier, not every mind thinks the same. Old minds think different than young ones, women tend to think different than men. People think differently based on how they grew up, where they are from, and much more. For this reason, it is also beneficial, and important to ask a variety of people. Asking multiple people for their advice is important, however, when you ask a variety of people from young to old, you can get an even better solution. This reason can also reflect back on the last reason which is stringing ideas together. Getting multiple points from a different variety of people makes the opinions you get more diverse. This can help your final thought or decision become agreed on by many people since you have a little bit of everything, and everyone in the final ""product"". This is yet another reason why asking multiple people for their advice is better for you.

In all, there are many reasons why asking more than just one or two people for their opinion or advice is much more beneficial, and these are just a mere few of them. Multiple opinions, a variation of people, and putting heads together are just a few very valid points that can be made. I strongly believe that asking multiple people for their advice is beneficially better for whoever is asking.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
893B6A0CDB2D,"When you have to make a choice in a situation you don't feel confident in the situation you will ask for advice; logically speaking, the more advice you get, the better your decision will be. This can apply in scenarios of where the decision maker is in a place of discomfort, bias, or lacking the confidence.

But nonetheless, this topic can't be resolved in just a paragraph, so we will continue onward.

This can apply in scenarios of where the decision maker is in a place of discomfort.

Being selected by yourself alone can be stressful enough, but when you must make a decision about a topic you may be uncomfortable with the end results can be deafening. The amount of pressure that would be placed on that person's shoulders alone could be extremely hurtful, and if they aren't even comfortable with the topic in the beginning than they just couldn't make a clear choice

But when they are gifted compassion and advice, they will be able to make a choice that was not created through a state of panic but a state of calm.

Another way might be when the decision maker has thoughts of bias.

A biased opinion would be one that was created out of personal thoughts alone without further research, and to have those sources in order to make a decision that will effect others who disagree with it.

When two different opinions are met, they will most likely either fight for their opinion, or accept that other people are allowed to have separate opinions about certain things. A biased person will not be able to do that without help. As long as there is bias, there will be a strong lining of stubbornness that will need to be broken down by facts and reasoning. The advice given by others will eventually do so, and then the decision maker will be able to present a fair, just, and unbiased choice.

The third and final would be lacking confidence in themselves to making the possibly life-effecting choice.

The kind of things that may be racing though a their heads would make it unbearable to decade what to do, you must have full confidence in order to make a choice that is set in stone.

When you ask advice, you ask from different point of view, one that has full confidence in themselves in order to give you an honest answer. The only to learn is through experience, therefore, the decision maker figure out on their own how to gain confidence by listening to someone who has confidence and is giving them advice.

In conclusion, the best way to make a fair decision is seeking multiple opinions from others in order to make the better choice.

Through advice, people who do not feel comfortable in the situation they are in will be able to give an answer that will be worth it; people of bias will be able to see past their personal views and give an equal answer; People who are not confident enough in themselves to make an exact answer will be able to learn and use those moments of submissiveness into teaching moments. Everyone deserves to make a choice, but there are always some people who need some help discovering it. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
6872BC56971B,"Everybody wants and needs advice sometimes, whether its once a day or a once a year. People who want advice, tend to talk to more than one person. There are lots of reasons why people ask for more than one persons advice whether its for more options and opinions, to feel stronger about what you are choosing, or to have more input and better view on the choice you are making.

When asking for advice, and you ask just one person, it is limited to just what that person said. If you ask more than one person, you can get more opinions and talk to more people and see what they think is right or wrong. Hearing other peoples opinions can change what you where going to choose and have a better take on what you are asking for. If you ask one person however, you do not get as much input and may choose the wrong thing. Asking more people can help you learn what the rights and wrongs are.

If you ask someone for advice and you do not feel so sure about what they told you, ask more and more people. If most of them say the same way than you will most likely feel stronger about what they are telling you to do. You also will have more reason to believe you are right. Even if you do, get different answers from other people, you should tell them what you think about it and it may change their mind.

You can get a better view on what you are asking for if you ask multiple people. More people, more opinions. That is good, getting more opinions can make you more sure about what you are choosing. If you don't fully understand what you are asking for asking more people can give you a better grasp on just what you are asking. On the other hand, it may make you more confused too.

Although, it may be hard to make a choice, asking more than one person can help. You can understand what you are asking a lot better, feel more confident about what you are choosing and, have more opinions and options. All these things can narrow down your choice and make it easier to make. Next time you need help with making a big choice, ask a few people. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
661426A2C8DE,"Have you ever wondered why seeking multiple opinions can help you make better choices? Seeking multiple opinions can aid someone into making a better decision. Having a repeating answer of advice and having safe answers can help.

When asking multiple people for advice, you might see a pattern of people saying similar things. Personally when I have a problem and need advice I would ask a friend or multiple friends for advice. Asking for your friends opinions and seeing what the majority of your friends say can aid in your decision making. Usually when you get the same advice repeated to you a number of times you will believe that the advice is what's best for you. If you keep getting told the same advice over and over again you should take it like I said. In real life situations getting a majority vote is how some people make hard decisions. Anyone could do the same, when your asking for advice and you are indecisive try to see how many people said the same thing and narrow it down to what you think would be the best for you. Getting advice repeated to you is the best way to tell if it's what you needed to hear.

When you are getting advice always try to see if the advice is going to persuading you into danger. If you think you might be doing something wrong or you might be in danger and you ask a friend or multiple friends and they say its fine, they might be a bad influence on you. Always ask a trusted adult or multiple adults for advice when you might be in danger to make a better and smarter decision, and also to not risk your safety. If you get the wrong or bad advice you might put yourself in danger if you take that advice. Always try to think what's best for you, and to not put yourself in any type of danger because of what someone advised you to say or do. When getting advice its best to see your safety as the top priority.

Seeking multiple opinions can aid someone into making a better and smarter decision. When you get advice repeated to you multiple times might be what's best for you. When seeking advice have your safety your number one priority. Getting multiple opinions does help you a lot when make a better decision. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
0EA59AC549C4,"ADVICE!! People talk to more than one person for advice because they could have better options. The more options a person has a better way they could do something. People from experience should have better advice then people that has not had the experience. The more advice you get the better off you are more advice becomes into better ideas. Advice also can give you more ideas and bigger and better ideas.

The first reason I think that seeking to multiple people trying to find advice is that people with the experience of the task can help you. People from experience should have better advice then people that has not had the experience. The more experience someone has normally can give you good advice about the task.

When I need help with something I personally like to go talk to older people because they are the most likely to know how to do it and make it easier for you. That is why I go to older people for advice 95% of the time.

The final reason I think asking multiple people for advice is to give the person better options for the task and possible better ideas for another project or task. I have asked people for advice for fixing a flat tire and I have asked multiple people for advice. Nobody seemed to know how to fix a flat without just buying a new tire. Then I asked my Grand-Pa for some advice and he said I have a perfect substance for this. He came out of the shed with some of this green stuff and he told me to squirt this in youre tire. I went home and squirted in my tire and it fixed my flat. Now this green stuff helps me with a lot of flat tires. If I havent of asked a lot of people then I would of had to get a new tire for all of my ATV's, UTV's, when they got a flat this green stuff has saved me a lot of money.

This is why I think you should ask more than one person for advice.

People from experience should have better advice then people that has not had the experience. The more advice you get the better off you are more advice becomes into better ideas. I hope this essay inspired you to ask people for more advice.                 ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
95AF348EDA56,"What was the hardest decision you ever had to make? Do you ever regret that decision now? Reflecting back, do you wish you could go back in time, and ask someone for advice? When people ask for advice, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. First, you get more of a variety of answers, and more opinions. Second, other people will see the situation differently, and they could see it more clearly then you do. Finally, once you talk about this situation that you need advice for, it usually becomes much easier to handle. Would you rather fight a war with soldiers on your side, or face it alone?

When you ask more than one person for advice, you get more of a variety of answers, and opinions. Just yesterday, I was asking my mom if I should buy a off-white water bottle, or a pale-blue one, for lacrosse. She said pale-blue, but after I asked her, I asked my friend Generic_Name, and she said off-white, so thats the one I got. We as a world full off homo-sapions are all different, my mom for example is 44, but my friend Generic_Name is the same age as me (13). What I am trying to emphasize here is that, the more different the person is, the more likely you are going to get more of a variety of answers. Asking different kinds of people is important because even though my mom may not be up to date with the current style, she is more mature, and has much more experience. On the other hand, I almost value Generic_Name's opinion more because we are very similar, the same age, and extremely close. Each persons perspective is different, and asking more than one person for advice, could really help you make the right decision.

Other people do not think the same way you do, so other people will see the situation differently. Our thoughts are as different, as dogs are to cats. Hypothetically, if you were to ask your friends and family for advice, they would all have different answers for you, and some may see the situation more clearly than you do. You are 75% more likely to choose the right way to handle a situation if you ask people for advice, and talk about it! Even asking someone that is not part of the situation (they are not biased) can help you because they will just say what they think without knowing anyone they are talking about. Always be careful to ask people for advice that you like and trust. Overall, just asking someone for advice can help you a lot because everyone is different, and this could really help you.

Once you talk about the situation that you need advice for, it usually becomes much easier to handle. Discussing things can help you make the right decision, and once you talk about it, some of its weight gets taken off of you. That is why you should never keep your feelings bottled inside you. Over the summer last year, my cousin was trying to decide which college to go to, because she had been accepted to many of her top choices. She asked her mom, dad, friends, and myself. She was still very undecided when I talked to her, but we discussed it, and I made a pro and cons chart to help her. After we discussed it, she felt much more relaxed, and made her decision easily. Trust me, I have made too many bad decisions, just because I never talked about it with anyone.

In conclusion, when people ask for advice, seeking multiple opinions can really help someone make a better choice. Here are the reasons why you should seek multiple opinions: you get more of a variety of answers, and more opinions, other people will see the situation differently, and once you talk about this situation that you need advice for, it usually becomes much easier to handle. Now you've herd me talk for awhile about this, but my question to you is as follows. After hearing all this about asking more than one person and so on, when you think about the hardest decision you had to make, would you go back in time and change it?",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
E8DD372E679E,"The prompt says ""When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Explain why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices."" I think the prompt is asking to explain how seeing others point of view can help you in a tough situation or just seeing others opinions can help you make better choices. The three reasons I think someone would ask for advice are if they didn't know what to do in a tough situation,seeing if someone is right on something,and helping someone make good decisions.

First, if someone doesnt know what to do in a tough situation. Sometimes we get ourselves in really bad situations. We don't always know what to do to get ourselves out of it, so we ask someone else. We ask them for help and they try to help us, so we can get out of the situation. Some people are afraid of coming out of their shell, by that I mean they are afraid to tell someone what is going on in life or theyre afraid to tell someone something bad that happened, but someone cant help you if you dont tell them whats going on.

Second, Seeing if someone is right on something. When your in a rough situation ,you talk to people about it. You may not always agree with them. They may take the wrong thing and tell you something different. Asking for more than one person's opinion can be a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing is if you ask more people youll eventually figure out what to do. The bad thing is you cant trust everyone, the more people you tell about a bad situation the more its gonna go around, so stick to people you can trust.

Last but not least, helping someone make good decisions. You know how parents are very controlling and bossy, and how they get on kids nerves when they tell them what to do. Kids don't realize that parents are just trying to lead you down the right path. Its the same thing with friends when your in a rough situation, they want to pull you out of it because they just want the best for you. Sometimes its not always what you want or what you agree with, but your friends and parents are the people who know you the best and they're just trying to help you. In life your going to go through one friendship after the other. You're not always going to have great friends, but theres always going to be one great friend that will help you through everything. Listen to that one friend because its going to be worth it.

In conclusion these are all reasons I would do if I was in a tough situation i didnt know how to get out of or if someone was helping me make good decisions. Remember to never be afraid to open up to someone, in the end it'll be worth it.     ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
8E2246CF7F85,"Do you think asking multiply people for advice is better than asking one person? Well I think asking multiple people for advice when I need it just to help me get a better understanding,better idea on what to do,see what other peoples thoughts are or sometimes see who gives better advice for future references. during this essay we will be talking about all those things and how they can help.

Getting a better idea on what to do from other people such as school counselors,teacher,parent or guardian,siblings, your friends or anyone you can trust to help,makes decision making so much better and easier. It's better to see different view points from different people. Than trying to make a hard decision or trying to explain something to someone or even having zero clue on what to do. For example trying to write a essay without brain storming or having any thought on what to write or type about its gonna be really hard and stressful.

seeing what other people think when getting advice can sometimes be difficult or helpful. It can be difficult if people dont understand or just dont know what to do and how to explain it to you to think they know what there talking about. It can also be helpful if they understand were your coming from or might have been in the same situation or been down the same path. when looking for advice try finding someone who knows whats going on or has or had the same situation. Make it easier on yourself to find those people even tho it might be difficult just remember you have those people listed above.

If you are ever needing advice ask multiple people for there input or thoughts to see who gives the info you think fits what you need such as, whos you like better, is more detailed,on the subject you need and helps the most and etc. when it comes to the people you ask for advice from it is most important you can trust them and they give you good advice and those are the people who can help you with future references when you need advice down the road. never rely on someone who is going to lie to you and you dont trust because those people will not help you and they will make it more difficult and confusing.

In conclusion asking multiple people for advice is more likely more reasonable to help you find what your looking for and get the information you will need than just asking one person who might have zero clue on what to tell you that will help your situation.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
63AFEF7824B1,"When people look to others for advice, it is because they cannot think of what to do themselves or they don't trust themselves enough to make good decisions on their own. Some people find it good to have an outsider's perspective, so they can see the situation from a different viewpoint. They also like to ask others what they would do in that situation, because everyone handles things differently. Occasionally people have gone through a similar situation, which often makes them knowledgeable on what to do. There are many ways to handle situations, but when in need of help you should confide in others for the best advice on how to make a better decision.

If you are in an argument with someone or you just need some advice, asking others is good for you to do because they can give you a new perspective. In an argument people tend to be very blindsided and naive, because they always think they are in the right. However there are always two sides to every story, and other people can help you see both. Many times you don't understand what someone else might be going through and it is always good for someone to humble you every now and then to make you understand others. Whenever something is going wrong, it's necessary to understand it ask someone else what they think by viewing all sides or the problem.

Another thing to ask when you need advice is what would they do in that situation. Often people think a completely different way then you, and would handle it in other ways then you. Most people are either passive aggressive or just aggressive and this can change the way they do things. With my problems I tend to be more passive aggressive, because I don't like arguments or confrontation, but most of my friends are the opposite. In times where I would normally not do anything until it becomes a big mess, my friends would already haven confronted the situation a long time ago. That was some reasons why asking others what they would do can help you come up with what you should decide.

Occasionally people have already gone through the exact same thing that is happening to you. This can make them wise, because they can use their past experiences to tell you what to do and what not to do. For example, when you need that push to do something you're scared of they can help you with that. When they tell you it went well for them, it helps you to follow in their footsteps. If there was a problem in their past experience they can warn you not to do that. One example might be that a girl dated this horrible guy who cheated on her, and she sees him with another girl so she talks to the the girl and warns the girl about what happened to her. Asking a person about their past experiences is one of the best ways to figure out what is right for you to decide.

The saying that other people show the best in you can be used when talking about giving advice, because people can show you new ways to see something or tell you something that you didnt know. Friends can show you the situation you are in from all different angles and not just the one you are stuck in. They can also tell you what they would do in your shoes, or how they would handle your position. Past experiences can change a persons perspective of their life so they don't make the same mistake twice, but they can also help others to not make the mistake at all. In conclusion, there are many ways others can help you for advice like sharing their past, saying what they would do, and showing you all perspectives. Everything talked about in this essay can help you come to your conclusion on what is best for you.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
64077B385B48,"Taking in multiple people's advice can benefit you in a variety of ways. As an example, most people take in more than one persons advice to see which would be the best advice for them,

Because some people give better advice than others. Another reason why people go to multiple people for advice is because, people thrive off of others opinion, you may not see it but when you give or take in others advice it can really benefit you or the significant other you gave advice to .Taking in multiple others advice is a plus because it helps you when you don't know what you want to do and it gives you options to choose from.

Roman philosopher Cicero said ""no one can give you wiser advice than yourself"",

But thats not necessarily true. Most people strive off of others ideas. Students at school have guidance counselors and teachers that they take advice from all of the time, and mostly it benefits them in numerous ways. Another benefit for asking more than one person for advice is one person may give you bad advice on purpose, but if you have a second option to go to hopefully you can figure out the best one.

When I was about seven or eight me and my sister had psychologists, We would both talk to one of the psychologists at a time kind of in a rotation. They would both give different advice and one was not always better than the the others. Taking in advice from both of them really benefited me, they both had different ideas of what I should do. Yes I was only eight years old but I could understand where both of them were coming from. And I had multiple ideas to choose from, But sometimes I didnt really like the advice that they me so I went to mom for some I ideas.

Advice does not always have to be about your personal life though, Say your at the store with your friends. And you say ""do you think i should buy this shirt"" theres always gonna be that one friend that says ""yeah

''you have the money"". But theres gonna be your other friend that says ""can you picture yourself wearing it because i know that if i dont love it in the store it's gonna just sit in my closet"" that actually happened to me once. I went with friends idea and saved a little bit of money doing so.

All and all taking advice from multiple people at once benefits citizens in numerous ways even me.

when you take in in multiple others advice it is a plus, because it helps you when you do not know what you want to do and it gives you options to choose from. If you talk to more than one person for advice it may mean that you were unsure of the advice you were given the first time.

D1400AFDC972,"People think getting advice from more than one person is to confusing to get. Some people think it's the best option. Other people that they're both right. So people think others ask more than one person is because they want, more advice, wiser advice, and you can get the best answer through others advice.

People get more advice from more than one person because they need more advice on the situation they're in. The reason this happens is because they want more advice so they can have more knowledge on their situation. Another reason this happens is because they're more experienced than you. This is just one of possible thousands of reasons.

Another reason is because they have wise advice for you and can help more. The reason this happens is because they need wiser advice from wiser people for some situations. Some people have good advice, but sometimes it's not the wisest. This is another reason people ask more than one person for advice.

My third reason is that you need answers. Sometimes the answers you want aren't the ones you need for a situation. So you can ask more than one person if they have the answers that you need. This is another reason people ask more than one person for advice.

So, these three reasons are because you either need answers, wise, or more advice. Every reason this stuff happens is because people just simply need advice.

My first reason is that it helps you think what choices are best for you when you need them. second, people that know you well like for an example your family, knows what's right or wrong for you. so you dont have to worry of what they're going to say. Because they know that they wont make you think more. finally, you will hear multiple opinions to hear from. Until you feel that you agree with any opinion. and knowing that it could help you prevent anything that could happen in the future when you need it.

My second reason is that it could help you get rid of the negative thoughts and thinking less when you know you have multiple advice and opinions. second, the more people you have by your side are the best choices you make. because they support you and will give you great advice. And also giving small talks (advice). because they know how you feel and know what you like to hear from others. finally, it could help to improve ideas and thoughts you might ve had in your head. because you think how you plan out your ideas without making a mistake.

My third reason is you have a chance to make better choices when you get advice from others. And it could also help not to make mistakes.

And usually thinks if it's worth it or not. finally you dont have to be alone when you need advice because their always that one person that is there for you to talk to even if you dont seem them familiar.

We all ask for opinions right? and its normal that we do because it could help us during life. Not everybody gets that chance like we do because some people been doing by their own and thats totally fine you could also do that but having others help you and giving you multiple options is a way easier to get a better future i know not all of might not agree with that and its fine because all people have different ideas!.

In conclusion, advice could take people anywhere even if you dont believe me. But it does. having a good variety of choices is better than having none. Because the good choices could take you to a better future, better education and good career. but having none could take no where. Unless you ask for some advice trust me you wont regret it. we only live once, try to make good life deiscions by letting others give you advice.             ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
DAAC37C0B251,"When you give someone advice you want to give them the best advice you can, right? In my opinion you should give them the best advice you can and if you don't then they can go see someone different. I think that you should try to see multiple people for advice. You should get multiple people's advice because if you only get one person's advice then the information might be bias, what they are telling you might not be correct, and it might be bad advice.

The first reason you should get advice from more than one person is the information might be bias. It might be bias because if are only hearing it from one person and only being told what they want you to know. If you only get advice from one person then you will only know one side of the story and then you wont know if they are right or wrong.

If you get bias information then you might never know the truth or you might not know what actually happened. You shouldn't get bias information because you might not be correct and you might also not know the truth.

The second reason you should get more than one persons advice is that they might not be correct. It might not be correct because you didn't hear from more than one person so then you only know what they think is correct and that might be incorrect. It also might not be correct because you only know what they want you to know so then you cant be sure of what the truth actually is. Your information might be incorrect because you only heard from one person, you only know what they know, and they might not be telling the truth.

Finally, what one person is telling you might just be bad advice. Some time people don't give good advice because they want you to get in trouble or they don't like you. Their advice could be bad because they might not know any better. Their information might be wrong because they might not know better, they may not like you, or they might have been thought that it is the right way when it is actually the wrong thing to do.

In conclusion, if you don't get multiple people's opinions then the information might be bias, it could not be correct, and it may just be bad advice. I believe that getting multiple peoples advice is very important in making an important decision. I think that you should get different peoples information because one persons idea could be different than others might be  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

From the minute we are born we are taught to always talk to a parent or guardian if we have an issue. But there are so many other people you could go to that would save you so much time and effort and they would give the exact same response as your parents. I believe you should always go to a separate opinion from that of your parental guardian and what you will find when you do so, is these other sources can teach you a lot more than your family and they have different experiences from those of your parents. your parents will always want the best and nothing more from you but think to yourself, ""do my parents really care about my issue or are they just trying to make me feel better about the problem at hand. So when you are done talking to your parents your decision is not made any easier, truthfully it's become a lot more challenging. Because you have been told what you expected them to say it's not helpful and you are disappointed.

I believe a great reason for going to another opinion for help is the fact that they won't sugarcoat the truth from you. They may not know you as well as your parents do and it could ultimately benefit you to hear the hard truth about the matter at hand. When you get constructive criticism from a peer it allows you to do a self evaluation on your problems and the different solutions you could use to solve your problems. That peer will always want the best out of you because it may be a close friend and they will understand you a bit better and they will always tell you your problem and try to help you understand what is wrong and what you should do. When you go to a second opinion you have to look back and think if you held back anything when you were talking to them, and if you didnt than you should expect them not to hold any of their emotions or feelings about the problem to you.

Another good reason for you to go seek a second opinion is that, they will always want to listen and seek understanding about your problems. If you are talking to family member they may not care about your problems or say something along the lines of ""oh honey it's ok you will be fine"" and them saying that is not fine and you should never be satisfied with that answer from anyone. Your friend or close peer, like a teacher or coach will want to understand your issue and they want to help you at all costs because they know that your a good kid and they never want to see you down,moody or upset ever. Your coaches put you through struggle and so do you teachers so they know you can handle the hard moments in life and want to always help you, so you can make the right decision. whenever you hear a question in class you want to seek understanding about the question so you can answer it the next time someone asks. The issue hear is very similar to that and when you have a problem or issue that you believe needs a second opinion they will always be willing to listen. That way they can ultimately impact your decision for the better and you will be so relieved and you will ask yourself why you didn't go to them earlier

I believe that when you go to an alternative opinion about a concern they can show you a different perspective of the situation at hand. Which then helps you become a better problem solver in general and having that skill can make some of the tough decision seem very easy. The moment your eyes become fully opened to the different outcomes of what you could say or do based on a simple decision. You start to almost think more logically when you are given the task of answering the hard questions about yourself and you realize that all the decisions you make, impacts you and only you so don't worry about someone else when making a decision about your livelihood. This will ultimately always end up as a better decision because you took the time to hear another way of solving the issue and you can factor that into your decision making and how you will handle the problem you needed to get advice about.

I personally have always believed in the idea of going to a second opinion about an issue and I always want to help people with their problems just like they help me with mine. You should never discredit your parent or guardians opinion because they could ultimately be correct when it's all said and done. However the minute you start only listening to your parents is the minute when your friends lose trust in you, and you lose trust in them. Remember that whenever a conflict is resolved or your problem is fixed you always have to credit someone for helping you with your problem and if that person is someone other than your parents than you have learned that your peers may be less experienced but they could be just as wise and just as intelligent as your parent or guardian. Finally when you make your ultimate decision based on the advice you were given you are very well informed and you can learn the different perspectives and different lessons that can be taught by different people and you come out of the experience so much wiser and smarter than you ever were before. That is why I believe going to a second opinion is beneficial towards your decision making and ultimately will help you in the long run with whatever issues arise.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
0611BEFA3685,"School classes, friends, colleges. What do all these things have in common? They all will need to be chosen by you and all of them will change you and your life. When most people are faced with a tough decision they might ask one trusted adult or friend for advice but I think that for better advice on tough decisions you should ask much more than just on person for advice.

One key reason for why it is good to seek out more than one persons advice is because you can get opinions and ideas from both sides of the argument. One of my best friends brother needed advice from all the people he could get on whether he should go to Penn State or Virginia Tech for college, and after asking all the adults and friends in our neighborhood about their opinion he decided to go to Virginia Tech. After making the decision he told us that ""I was originally going to choose Penn State but after hearing opinions on why I should go to Virginia Tech I instantly changed my mind"". This shows that when making big life changing decisions it is good to seek help from a lot of people that way you can get opinions about the other side that can change your mind into making the right choice.

On the same coin for why it is better to ask more people for there advice than just one person is because they might give you new reasons and ideas you may not have thought of or considered. In a survey recorded by the Generic_Name organization of counseling taken by college graduates it proved that 96% asked for advice from more than one trusted adult and of that group 79% said that more than half the people they asked gave them new Ideas or opinions that they had not thought of and played an influence on their overall decision. Even the people say that getting advice from more than one person is better and they also very clearly say that it can help by giving you new Ideas, motives, and even rewards.

Likewise for why you should get advice from as many people as you can is because you could get advice and help from people who have went through what your going through. Former MLB all star shortstop Raquan Oswald states ""I dont think I would be where I am today if it wasnt for my dad who knew exactly what I was going through and helped me get through it better than he did"". Everybody has been and will be faced with tough decisions and a lot of advice helps but nothing is better than somebody who know what your going through and is there to help.

All in all getting one persons advice is not nearly as useful as getting a lot of peoples advice. This is clearly visible by how you can get opinions from both sides, new diverse ideas, and more people who can relate. If you are ever going through a tough decision all you have to do is ask as many people as you can that are trustworthy, will give you good advice that is doable, and make sure that they want to help you and that it is not for their own selfish reasons.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
1F2351768406,"It is good to ask multiple people for advice. There are times where you cannot figure out the solution to your problem and your friends can help. Although getting advice from one person is good, having two or more opinions will help. There are a couple reasons why it is better to get two or more advices. Firstly, if you ask two people and they have the same opinion or advice then you should consider doing what they say. Secondly,one advice might not benefit you. Lastly, if you ask multiple people you have a better idea of what you could do.

Doctors have different opinions when treating sicknesses. For example, if you have a cold, one doctor could recommend you take certain pills and if another doctor agrees, then you could take them. Also if you had a gap in your teeth and your tooth hasn't come out, one orthodontist could say to get surgery and another orthodontist could confirm it, then you should make your decision.

If you are going through depression it is wise to tell your parents not your friends. Sometimes friends can tell you to do wrong things which will end up hurting you. Also if you have bad grades, your friends, who have dropped out, might tell you to drop out of school, but your parents tell you to try harder. You should always choose the wiser choice. One advice could be fatal but multiple give you more opportunities.

Finally, when you get multiple opinions, you can get a better idea of what you can do.

For example, if you have a project and you don't know what to do. You can ask your friends what they are doing or they can give you tips. If multiple friends tell you ideas, then out of those you can create your own.

In conclusion, getting multiple opinions or advice can help you decide which is best for you.

Sometimes one might not be the best but another could. Also multiple opinions can confirm something you've heard. Always ask for multiple advice on health issues if you have any. If you have multiple opinions, it could potentially be a lifesaver.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
79745179D7CE,"It is good to get advice from more than one person. Why, well first of all someone could give you bad advice or the wrong advice that is going to get you in trouble. Then someone could give you okay advice but it could always be better. You could use there advice and it could help but it could also still cause you to get in trouble or it could solve the problem but still not be great. Lastly you would have more options to make the right choice if you only have one opinion on what to do again it might not be the right choice and having more is way better. You also have more understanding of what you could do or what you could do but it would get you in more trouble.

For example i got bad advice one time and i lost some of my really good friends because i thought it would be smart to listen to him. So now i know to have more options because i made a mistake on one having one opinion on what to do.

Another example i was invited to a really cool place, but didnt know if i should go so asked for advice. i got bad advice okay advice and really good advice. I knew not to pick the bad but not sure if the okay was good enough so i picked it and never went it was crazy but it thought me to usually go with the good advice.

Having options can help you or the people around you so you dont make the mistake of having bad advice. thats why you ask for more opinons on things and you could even give good advice and tell them to also ask more people.

So, you should always have more than one option or advice to make it more helpful to you or the people around you and have better choices for things in life.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
505A24640C8D,"When people ask for advice, there is a possibility that they will go to more than one person for advice. We all have given and gotten advice. Opinions have a big impact on people, with the advice given to us we can make the right choice. I think that people seek advice from multiple people because the person being asked could have experienced it already or the person asking doesn't know what to do in their situation so they ask multiple people so they can make the right choice.

One reason I think people go seek advice from multiple people because the person being asked could have experienced it already. There are some people in this world that have done much experiencing in their lives. For example I like to have fun, be adventurous, and try new things but my sister is not like that. My sister likes to stay indoors and not do anything fun, so she hasn't really experienced much. Therefore, when it comes to asking for advice she goes to people that she knows has experienced things around that topic so she can make the best choice. I think people go seek advice from multiple people because the person being asked could have experienced it already.

My last reason I think people go seek advice from multiple people because they might be stuck in a sticky situation and not know what's the best choice. Someone could have their own personal problem and need advice to make the best choice. If I was stuck in a situation like that I would've asked my friends, family, and acquaintances to give me advice and help me figure out the best choice. Depending on a persons problem or situation I would give them advice on how to make the best choice or how I made my choice if I went through the same thing.

I think people go seek advice from multiple people because they might be stuck in a sticky situation and not know what's the best choice.

In conclusion, I think that people seek advice from multiple people because the person being asked could have experienced it already or the person asking doesn't know what to do in their situation so they ask people so they can make the right choice. I think getting advice from people is pretty important. If I never asked for advice, I would be so lost in the world because I would be making both bad and good decisions.

DF8A499373F4,"Here we are. Going through a difficult time. And you don't know who to go to. So you ask multiple people for advice or there opinion. To be honest that is better. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice. I think it is better to seek multiple opinions because you get multiple point of views, you can choose one out of the many opinions you have, and if you only go to one person you don't have any other choice.

First of all, it is extremely hard if your going through a problem and you dont know who to go to. So you tell a variety of people you trust. Let's say it's your mom, your best friend, your cousin, and your mentor. They will all give you different ideas on how to solve out your problem or will give you multiple opinions. If you ask me, it is better that way. I believe it is better like that because you get multiple point of views on how they would solve a problem. Also, if you don't like the opinions that 2 of the people gave you, you dont have to worry. You have the other 2 people's opinion to focus on. At the end of the day, you choose the one you like better or the one you think it is easier to follow.

Then, let's just say you got all the people you trust opinions. You have 4 in total. You can choose one out of the many opinions you have. If you dont like one, you can go to the other. You don't have to stress about it because you told the people you trust. They would not want the worst for you. They would want you to move on from this difficult situation that you are going through. Also, you could combine the advises. You have multiple of them and if they are all really good, you could use all of them.

Lastly, if you only go to one person, you dont really have any other choice. Let's say that you decided to go to one person, your mom. She gives you advice on how to deal with the situation and you don't really like it that much. But what other opinions would you be going too? You would already have to much on your mind to think of another idea. So, if you seek for multiple opinions, there you can choose which one you enjoy better and you dont have to stress out about what other things you should do.

In conclusion, I think it's better to seek multiple opinions because you get multiple point of views, you can choose one out of the many opinions, and if you only go to one person, you dont have an other choice. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

ou can ask many different people for advice. Perhaps a teacher or a consular, maybe even a parent.

Asking a teacher for advice can be very helpful and effective. You could be asking for advice on something in their class like math,science or history, but you could surely ask them for advice on anything. like how to make a friend or how to help a friend with something going on. Maybe ask a designer teacher or a workshop teacher for advice on how to decorate a room or house. You can pretty much ask your teachers for advice on anything school related or not.

When asking a consular for advice you can literately get advice on anything,same thing goes with a therapist. They both give good advice for things going on at home, school, work and just everyday life. They'll give you advice on everything. All you have to do is ask for it, and tell them what its about. I generally think that consular are good people to ask for advice from.

Last but certainly not least parents. Asking parents for advice can be helpful, but sometimes its can be awkward and stressful and you dont get the help that you needed. Parents can give advice on everything, but it may not be the best to follow, sometimes parents or just people in general dont believe what you believe in, so you might not get the answer your looking for.

But over all asking multiple people for advice is good because you can get many different opinions to find the best one you like. Because going with one opinion and one option could turn out wrong. But if your gut says go for it, then go for it. Those are the reasons i think you should get advice from multiple different people, because then you will find your true answer.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
C02A65E91884,"It is good to ask for advice from multiple people instead of one person because if you are in a such a horrible situation that could end up with you and a loved one saying nasty things at each other that you dont really mean. You would need advice from multiple people to prevent that happening because if you go to you one of your closest friends asking for their advice, but they might accidentally give you the wrong advice with out meaning too. Asking for multiple different people's advice can give you different opinions, and backup advice.

If you receive several different opinions it could help you make a good decision based on your situation. For example if you only ask one person for advice on how to study for a big test, but instead of giving you good advice on how to study that person accidentally gave you bad advice and you end up failing that test. But if you asked 3 different people for advice and two people recommend one similar way to study, and the other person recommended a completely different way to study then chose the most recommended way to study for the test because most likely those to people used the same strategies and did really well.

Having backup advice will help if the advice you took in the first place doesnt work. Then you have other advice to fall back on. Here is an example: If you are starting a new business for the first time and you go to a two different people who have already started a business and person number one said ""Work on getting a facility to work in"", and person number two said ""make as much money as possible first"". You go with person number one's advice which is to get a facility to work in. The advice that you went with didn't work very well, so you go to advice number two which is to make as much money as possible and that advice worked wonderfully. Its always good to have backup advice that you can use if the original fails.

Seeking diferenent people's advice can help you in multiple ways like having different opinions, and backup advice to use if the original advice fails.

Therefore, I believe that getting multiple opinions when you're asking for advice can help you make a better choice because you will get different points of view, you could get tons of ideas from asking multiple people, and different people can help you with different questions.

Firstly, I think that if you ask multiple people for advice, then you will get different points of view. In addition, people tend to make the best choices from talking to multiple people and getting lots of advice from them. Also, people think very differently so you can get fantastic advice from one person and terrible advice from another person. The people in your life want to see you succeed so they will give you advice to make the best choice possible.

Additionally, I believe that you can get tons of great ideas from asking multiple people for advice. The people in my life have given me amazing ideas when I asked for advice. Those ideas have led me to make the best choice possible for the situation. For example, I asked everybody in my family how to get better at sports and each one of them gave me a great idea and I improved significantly. Also, if you have lots of ideas then you can make a smarter choice than if you only had one idea.

Lastly, different people can help you with different questions. For example, I asked my mom and dad how to be less stressed in school. My mom told me exactly what to do and my dad didn't know what to say, so if I only asked my dad then it wouldn't have helped me much. Therefore, multiple people can give you different advice.

When a difficult decision comes about, most laborious people may not have the time to research the topic, but they may want to seek others perspectives about the situation. The benefits of asking multiple sources for opinions on a decision or a situation are much greater than just asking for one idea or opinion. The typical person might begin to seek the situation or decision in a unique way after hearing the opinions of multiple groups. When advice is necessary, asking multiple quality resources may be beneficial towards your cause because citizens can here the backgrounds and beliefs of many diverse groups of people, listen to different sides of the story, and come up with a conclusion that involves all of the ideas that you have comprehended.

To begin with, if you ask multiple people about a certain situation, different groups of people may respond in unique ways. The ideas being stated may not go along with the beliefs of the person, but citizens may be inspired by a certain part of their belief on the situation and incorporate it into their decision. The shared ideas of each group may help you realize which way or the other is the popular and more beneficiary way to go. If someone does not endorse a certain opinion, you can just move on to the next person and see what perspective they have to offer. Generally, the people that someone trusts on consulting them for a life time or short time decision thinks the same way about a certain topic as the others, and the citizen can detect the patterns and choose the most respectable decision.

The pros and cons of each school need to be considered in order to make the decision with the most evidence behind it. When considering multiple things, hearing from multiple people can help you come up with the positives and negatives of each situation.

After that process, a conclusion needs to be conducted. After hearing multiple reasons about the situation, the person can combine the ideas of each person or group and resolve the conflict with a combination of the thoughts of many sources. If you are in a situation that requires creativity, the thoughts of many may be incorporated into your decision. Although, a situation such as my high school one needs to be considered so you can come down to the right school by evaluating the ideas and thoughts of others. The beauty in asking multiple sources is being able to find a conclusion that fits the citizen and the people that have been consulted.

To conclude, asking multiple people for advice can result in the most logically correct decision being made. Hearing from different backgrounds with different beliefs can influence a decision because you can hear a situation in a unique way. Also, hearing the negatives and positives of a situation from different sources can help the citizen narrow their selection down. Finally, the person can come up with a conclusion that supports their ideas and the thoughts of others. Asking multiple people can be more influential than asking just one person for advice because the beliefs of different groups can be convincing, the positives and negatives people have to offer about the situation can make it a whole lot easier, and a conclusion can be made that considers all of the advice that you have received.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
EF8D535C76AE,It would help to ask other people for advice but it helps when there's more than 1 person giving you advice. Each opinion can help you simplify your question. For example if you ask one person what they think you should do but you dont like their answer someone else could help cut down what you think feels right and wrong that could help you decide. When you ask other people for advice some times you can feel relieved and for some reason you dont feel like you are alone anymore and you don't have to worry as much as you used to. For example if someone were to be suicidal asking someone for help can make you feel relieved that there is a way to help that person. If you have more than one choice but you don't seem to like some of them you can ask a friend or a parent/guardian for some help on what to do. For example if I could choose to get a pet or not maybe someone has a pet and they could tell me the responsibility and cost of taking care of a pet. Maybe someone has experience that you don't so maybe it would be best asking for advice from someone who is more experienced. For example if I wanted to start getting more muscle I would ask someone I know that has been doing it for a long time to help me get more muscle by teaching me what to eat and what to not eat and what to do and how. One of the most important thing before you ask advice from the person is do you believe that he/her will not lie because if he/she gives you bad advice then you can make a very wrong decision thats why you need to be able to trust the person giving you advice. ,2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
5678FED807E0,"Have you ever been in a situation where you couldn't decide what to do? Maybe you asked a friend or family member for help. Asking for advice is one of the best things a person can do when faced with a difficult decision. When asking for advice, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it helps them see all sides of the situation, it makes them aware of all the possible options, and it helps them not make a decision based on bias.

When making a choice, it is always good to think about things from all sides of the situation. Different people have different points of view, and will see the situation differently depending on their background or personal experiences. Asking multiple people for their opinion helps to give one a wide range of viewpoints to help them make a good decision. For example, suppose a student was deciding if they wanted to take all honors classes in high school. Instead of asking just one person for their opinion, they could gather more information about the honors program from all points of view and then make their choice. They could ask an older sibling who is in honors and loves it, and also their friend who is taking the same classes and struggling in order to see all of the pros and cons and decide if it is right for them. Seeking multiple opinions will show you all points of view and help you make a more educated decision.

Asking for multiple opinions makes one aware of the different possible options. When someone asks a person for their opinion, that person they ask will have in their head one option that to them is the right option. However, the right option for them may not be the right option for someone else. Asking for multiple opinions ensures that a person learns about all of the possible options and their outcomes and effects. There is one very common real world example of this. When people go to the doctor and are diagnosed with a condition, they often ask for a second or even third opinion. They want to be absolutely certain that the diagnosis is correct, and that they receive the medical care and medication that is right for them. Different doctors will have different treatment plans, and going to multiple doctors makes one aware of all the possible actions they can take, and helps them decide which is best for them.

When giving advice, people are often biased. Asking for multiple opinions can help prevent one's decision from being affected by bias. In the same way that getting your news from only one channel will give you only that channel's biased spin on events, asking only one person for advice gives you only one opinion, which may be affected by bias. Asking multiple people gives you multiple opinions to decide from, and you will avoid making a decision based on one person's biased point of view. For example, let's say your family was deciding what type of pet to get, By asking just your dog owning neighbor for advice, you'll get his biased opinion on why dogs make the best pets. By asking a variety of people who own a variety of animals, you will ensure that the choice you are making is not entirely based on the bias of one person. Or suppose someone is deciding who to vote for in an election. Asking a friend that supports one candidate will give them that one biased point of view, but by asking multiple friends with different viewpoints they can decide for themselves which candidate they prefer.

In conclusion, looking for more than one opinion can help a person make a better decision. One example of this in my experience was when my family was deciding on which orthodontic practice to take me and my siblings to to get braces. Instead of going to one orthodontist office and then stopping there, we went to multiple places to hear what their plan and prices were before making a final decision. Because we went to multiple practices and got multiple opinions, my family was able to make the decision that is right for us. When making a decision, seeking multiple opinions will always help someone make a better choice.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0

Do you need help when it comes too challenging sitituions and problems? Things aren't that easy in the world when sititutions you just don't know what to do, seeking or asking for someone advice is very help in a way. For example picking an new outfit for school you like two choices but don't know which one to pick because the two outfits are both cute so you ask one of your family members or ask a friends for their opinions on which outfit is the best looking.

There are problems in life where you just don't know what direction to go in. Asking a good amount of people for their advice or their options are good so you can see an other person point of view or perspective of what they seem is good or bad for the sitituions. Like looking for a car isn't that easy there are so many brands,colors and other feature on a car you might like and it might be more than one you like but just don't know what to choice.

Advice can be and good, helpful thing or bad, hurting thing some people are gonna give you good advice that can help you in a way and some people are gonna give you horrible advice that can hurt you in a way, say you are dealing with a sitituion with your boyfriend or girlfriend some people advice is gonna be that y'all should talk and work the problems out well on the other hand someone is gonna tell you that you don't need him or her or that person should apologize first when you were wrong and you might listen. It depends are what kind of sititution a person is in on what type of advice too give that person.

EE3BABC4649F,"Whenever I seek advice I would rather go to multiple opinions then one.

I need help in a xbox game or if i'm talking to a girl, I talk to Generic_Name. If I need help in school or i'm in trouble anywhere else I talk to my mom. Or if I need spiritual advice I used to talk to Generic_Name. I do that because my mom is not a boy and she wouldn't know what to say and Generic_Name isn't spiritual so he couldn't help me.

My mom once went to school once, and she admits she gotten in a lot of trouble also. So whenever I get in trouble, she tells me what I did wrong and right and how to fix it. Generic_Name is in my school with me so I really cant ask him because we go through the same thing. I dont talk to my Generic_Name anymore so he couldnt really give me his opinion on my behavior. Thats why mom is perfect to go for school advice.

Generic_Name is my best friend so we play a lot of games together. We also play a lot of games by our selves so we know a lot of things that the other doesnt know. So when I dont know something he can tell me how and why to do it. Also with girls because we both talk to girls and he knows so I dont know and I know some he doesnt know. Even though I know more we still talk about it.

I met Generic_Name on xbox over the summer. He was different then anybody I ever met. He was really into spirituality and he always told me to follow it. He always told he was truth about things that nobody ever wanted to speak on but he told me to me never believe him. He told me spirituality will teach me all the things he knows. So whenever I needed help meditating or anything he would teach me. He really changed my life with his opinion and advice.

In conclusion, they all helped me a lot. They all have different opinions and advice that make me who I am. Without different advice I would basiclly be a spitting imagine of them. Following all their advice and just believing it all. Thats why I thing people need to talk to more than one person for advice. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
3F0E512E243F,"Have you ever wondered why seeking more than one person for advise is better than asking from one person. More than one person is always good especially when you are looking for advise. Also you can get more answers than from one person. Seeking advise from more than one person is better than just one person because one you have more answers to listen to, also different people to get advise from.

First there are more answers to your problems when you have more people . First they can give you better advise than one person. One person can give you advise but with multiple people they have different perspectives than one person. Secondly it is more help full than one person like I just said more than one person can help you more because of how different they are and how they think. Also more people that you can ask the better advise you can take back from and you will probably make better choices .

There are a lot of people you can get advise from like your friends for example. Your friends are like family and they probably know you a lot maybe not better than you parents but they know how to help you when you need it. The second person you can ask for advise can be your mom she probably knows yo the best out of every one and she knows what is best for you and what is not best for you. Lastly the last person you should get advise from is your school counselor. Your counselor can give you advise maybe not as good as your parents but they can give you some great advise so you can make better choices. All of those different people can help you with your problems and will give you great advise.

in conclusion I think having more than one person to get advise from is better than just one person. More people in general is better than one person and mostly for advise. After reading this essay do you think that you will ask more than just one person for advise in the future ?                                 ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
69EE2FC28DD0,"Need some help? Ask a friend, matter a fact ask multiple friends. When you have a decision or choice to make, that you dont know about, you should always ask multiple friends. You should ask for advice because people have different opinions or they might just know what to do in your spot. They could of also been in that situation. So anytime you need help ask a friend.

A lot of People have different opinions and ideas to a decision needed to be made. If you ask multiple people on a choice you need to make and majority of the people say you shouldn't make that choice and barley any people say you should what would you do? You wouldnt make the choice right? Because majority of the people said its not a good idea or its not a good choice to be made. The small amount of people that said not to make the choice may be trying to get you to fail or the choice might have been easier or different to them because people opinions are different. It's always good to ask multiple people on a choice needed to be made because some people opinions and actions are easier or harder then others or its a good idea or a bead idea to others.

Another reason why you should ask multiple friends on advice on a decision is because some people might have been through that same situation. Some people may have been in that situation and know what to do in that situation because of the experience. They have been in your shoes at a time a they know what to do. You can ask them what they did in that situation, and how it can be better. You can also just ask what to know in that situation. So if you know a friend that been in a situation that your going through ask them because they most likely know what to do.

The most important reason for me on people opinions and asking for advice is that the more help, the more advice you get, the easier it is. If people tell you information about the choice or they help you through it, giving you advice it would be easier right? But if you dont ask a friend and you just do it on your own you wouldnt have as much information on the situations as you did if you asked a friend. The situation,decision,or choice needed to be made could be a lot easier if you just ask for help .So remember it is always important to ask a friend even if you feel like you know what to do.

This is why I think that seeking multiple opinions can help some one make a better choice because you never know what people know about that situation or the advice they can give you. If you communicate to your friends about the decision that choice would be easier to make. So anytime you are in a situation and you need advice, or you need help, don't be quiet or dont do it by your self and just ask a friend for some help. Its not just a friend you can ask for help. You can ask a trusted adult , a parent or guardian, or even your teacher, all of them have been in a situation like you. So it's important to ask for help.      ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
C68A69F99946,"At some place like NASA, when they are building these multi-million dollar space crafts, do you think they have one person who designs everything, checks his own work once and then they send these ships into space? The answer is no. They have a bunch of different people checking their numbers and working on these projects because it's the most effective way. Talking to more than one person before making a decision can help you when trying to solve a problem, research, or at your job just like they do at NASA.

The first way asking multiple people can help you is if you are trying to solve a problem. In school if we have a hard homework assignment I'll usually text two of my friends in that class. One time one of them was out of town, and my other friend and I both got a question wrong. We both then got points taken off. If we would have had a third person to check the problem we probably could have figured it out. If you are trying to solve a problem by your self, you can never guarantee you'll get it right.

The next way asking multiple people can help you is when you are researching something. If you have a topic you are really interested in you will usually read more than one article or book about it. I love to read, and I love sports, so when there if there is some big nationals trade I'll read a few articles about the new players or just about the trade. If there is a paper I have to do for school I'm also going to check more than one website so I can see more than one point of view.

The last way asking multiple people can help you is in your everyday job. My dad is a plumber. One time he came home from work and said that he was supposed to fix a fouset that day, but the pipe valves he bought were the wrong size. There was one size that almost every house in America has, but this house was different. They had bought $50 worth of pipes and didn't even use them. He then had to buy new ones and fix the fouset another day. He had checked with the mother but she said that she wasn't sure what size they needed. If he would have checked with the father of the family they wouldn't have wasted the pipes. Another job that you would check with more than one person would be coaching. When a coach picks his or her team they probably check with the second coach and decide together who they will pick.

It can never hurt to ask more than one person for advice. Seeking multiple opinions can always help making a better choice. Whenever you are trying to decide something ask two of your friends and they can only help. Talking to more than one person before making a decision can help you when trying to solve a problem, research, or even at your job.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F09ACEC4850C,"Have you heard the saying two heads are better than one? Because, having more opinions are better when making tough choices. Having multiple opinions might lead you to a more realistic choice like deciding how to spend your money, or the popular choice like deciding what color to paint the wall, or even the correct choice like on a test. For example, last week I asked a friend for his opinion on a question and got it right. Because, I had asked his opinion and, he pointed out the hidden ""not,"" I got the answer correct.

First off, having multiple opinions might lead you to a more realistic choice. Like if, you're planing to get a dog and, your friend shows you that it costs a lot to care for dogs so you don't end up buying it. Or maybe, you want to learn a foreign language and, your friend reminds you you can't spell anything, so you don't doing it. Or if you're like me, and you shoot for straight A's but, you miss a lot of school days, so your friend just tells you to try to just get mostly A's and some B's so that you still have a good grade. Because he gave me his opinion, I didn't stress my self over trying to get a higher grade.

Secondly, having multiple opinions might lead you to the popular choice. Like, if you are split between two types of flooring, you can ask for someone's opinion so that way you can decide. Or if, your deciding what to bring to the party just ask for everyone's opinion on what to bring. Okay, I've brought some cookies to a party before and someone was allergic, so let's just say you should probably get someone's opinion on the matter before you bring something to a party. Because, that child may or may not have been hospitalized cause of the cookies.

Finally, having multiple opinions might guide you towards the correct choice on the matter. For example, if you got lost driving somewhere and, you can ask one of the locals opinion's on where to go. Maybe you're on a game show, and you ask the audience for their opinion on what to chose and it ends up being right. Or once, I took a quiz once and asked for my friend's opinion on a question and it help me get the right answer. Because if didn't ask their opinion I would have got the question wrong.

Have you learned the benefits of asking opinions when making a choice yet? If you haven't, go ask a couple of people for their opinions in real life, the results might surprise. Because, your way of thinking may be a whole lot different from mine and somebody else's, it's good to get many people's opinion. Also, just because your opinion is not the same as somebody else's, doesn't always mean your wrong you just both look at it a different way. Having multiple opinions will probably lead you to a more realistic choice, or popular choice, or even the correct one.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

53F1450AF8DF,"How many opinions do you need before you can make a decision? Well, I know that for me personally I ask many people their opinions about my situation and about what actions I should take before my final decision is made. That's just how most people are, they ask many people, they get many opinions, and then they decide which they think is best. However, most people probably don't know why they seek multiple opinions instead of just asking one person. So today I'm going to tell you why you shouldn't just ask one person's opinion because it's so much better to get multiple opinions from multiple different people. Asking many people for opinions can help you make better decisions because it allows you to see the situation from many different viewpoints, it helps you find out what the majority of people think, and it gives you the opportunity to deliberate what option is your best course of action based off many more than your own reasons.

First, it allows you to see your situation from perspectives that aren't your own. When you just ask one person for their opinion on your situation, they might agree with you. But, you know what happens when you just ask one person and they agree with you; you go with your ""gut feeling"" and if you do that then there was no point in asking for an opinion in the first place. However, if you ask multiple people for their opinions then you get many different perspectives, so you can see the situation through the eyes of the person you're fighting with, or running a business with, or having a baby with, etc. That way you can make the better choice because you can now see from the other person's view and understand why they are arguing against you.

I often have trouble making decisions about anything, I could be asked what I want for lunch and an hour later I still wouldn't have decided what I want for lunch. For example, I didn't used to eat breakfast at McDonalds, but one day I was hungry and I couldn't decide on what I wanted for breakfast, so I called a few people and asked for a few opinions about Sausage Mcgriddles. Some people said they were terrible, so terrible in fact they would be comparable to eating dirt; however, many more people said that Sausage Mcgriddles were delicious, they said that biting into a Sausage Mcgriddle was like biting into a world of pancake, syrup, and sausage heaven; they said it was a whole breakfast in one sandwich. So, now that I had seen from both viewpoints of the situation I made the choice of eating a Sausage Mcgriddle; and in my opinion it was the best choice I could've made.

Secondly, it helps you find out what the majority of people think. To most people that sounds like a bad thing; most people hear throughout their lives the words ""quality over quantity"". Often times, this is true, especially when it comes to consumer goods. But, if the statement ""quality over quantity"" was always true, why is it not used on everything? Well, when it comes to opinions quality is only determined by your opinion of the opinion. That's why presidential elections use quantity not quality because opinions don't have an official quality. The same is applied to any survey or poll that exists, they all are based on the numbers. So, if the president, the leader of the country, is elected by numbers, why shouldn't you have your own little election when you are faced with a difficult decision and you can't decide what choice is better?

Thirdly, if you ask multiple people for their opinions, you're going to get many reasons as to why they think that way. When people face difficult decisions and they a few choices they often try to come up with their own reasons as to why they should choose any one choice. Unfortunately, people, like myself, aren't the greatest at coming up with their own reasons. So, when you ask multiple people their opinions, you can base your choice on more than just your own, most likely self-centered, reasons. But, if you only ask one person then you're only going to get a few reasons that are based on one opinion and when you can't come up with reasons yourself a few reasons and one opinion isn't helpful.

At last, you've, hopefully, learned and realized why you shouldn't bother thinking about just asking one person for their opinion. You should ask multiple because with just one opinion you can't do anything. If you just ask one person you only get one opinion, and with one opinion you certainly can't find the majority because it's only one opinion. When you ask multiple people their opinions you can find the majority, if you don't want to go with the majority you can use the opinions to look at the situation from a different perspective, and if you don't want to do that just list all the reasons the people had behind their opinions and then decide, in your opinion, which reasons are good, logical reasons and what course of action do they support.

Some people ask for multiple opinions when they need advice. I think this is a great idea because you can get multiple views on a topic,you won't have to worry about bias and it gives you different options on how to solve your problem.

To begin with, asking more than one person for advice means you will receive several different views on a topic. This is important when it comes to getting advice because you want to be able to make the best decision possible. For example, if you have a serious health issue arise in your life you might go to more than one doctor or specialist to make sure you're getting the right diagnosis and treatment. Even if you're not having health issues it never hurts to get different views to assist you in making the best choice. Always take these different views into consideration when making your final decision!

Additionally, getting multiple opinions means you won't have to worry about bias. When asking for advice or for someones opinion you don't want to ask just one person and end up getting a bias opinion. So, reaching out to more than one person almost eliminates the chances of that happening. When asking for advice I personally always ask people who are going to help me make the best decision and not someone who is going to give an opinion based on how they feel about the topic. Bias is hard to detect and sometimes it might even feel impossible,it can be confusing too. Just take your time and don't rush yourself when making decisions.

Lastly, you'll have many different options to choose from. This is so important, because then you won't have to feel stuck. For example, if you were to loose your job you would want another job or career to ""fall back on"" or in other words have a back up plan. Without another option you might feel confused or even lost. When making a decision the last thing anyone wants is to have all of those other emotions that's another reason have multiple options is important.

In conclusion, having multiple options,not receiving bias and, seeing different point of views are all reasons I believe it's a good idea to ask for multiple opinions when asking for advice and making a decision. Everyone will ask for advice at least one time so, when you do keep these tips in mind to help you make the best decision possible. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C53440E341ED,"Have people ever wanted to know if seeking out multiple opinions or getting more advice will help them get a better answer?

Well today is that day.

I will be doing research to see if asking for more advice and multiple opinions is better.

In my opinion I think it is.

These are a few resons I think asking people for more advice can help.

When asking for advice people get a more broad look at what there is, it might change peoples ideas for the better, and if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did.

Firstly, when asking for advice people get a more broad look at what there is.

If people want to see what other choices they can make they can ask others.

Most of the time the person people ask will likely have chosen a differnt path than another person.

Which means that there is a higher chance of people geting multiple opinions by everyone.

People will most likely have a better choice if they ask more people for help them.

When people ask for more advice it is always better for them.

Out of 10 people that ask for more advice 9 of them will have a better outcome than the people that didnt ask for more than 1 opinion.

When I get a broad look on something I normally have a few better choices that I will make.

Secondly, it might change people ideas for the better.

If people are ever questioning if the choice they are going to make is bad then they should ask for advice.

Because, when people hear advice from somebody else it could change their whole perspective about the choice they were going to make.

When people hear advice or multiple opinions there is a higher percentage of them being more succesfull than others that dont ask.

Asking for more advice is always helpful because it can help people choose a better job or a better car.

Lastly, if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did.

By seeing the outcomes of what they did people can see if the outcome is positive or negative.

If it is positive people should probably take this advice and learn form it to make better dicisions or make a good choice.

If the outcome is negative dont take this advice because it might lead people down the wrong path.

If someone find two people with two good opinions and they dont know what to choose they should choose the one that fits them the best.

If they dont find one that is good for them then they should go with what fits them the best.

When seeking multiple opinions and asking for advice to make better choices people should always make sure they find advice that fits them best.

People schould always do this just so they have a better outcome.

These are a few resons I think asking people for more advice can help.

When asking for advice people get a more broad look at what there is, it might change peoples ideas for the better, and if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did.

There are so many benefits of doing this including hearing different point of views, listening to people who have gone through similar situations, and seeing how the majority of people respond. If anything, asking multiple people for advice can only help you in the long run.

The first reason you should always ask multiple people for advice is hearing different point of views. You could ask 3 different people how they would handle your situation and they could all have completely opposite answers. Everyone has their own take and perspective on the problem. It's really important to listen to what everyone has to say so you can make the best choice based on all the advice you were given. Asking a group of people for advice, instead of just one, can really open your eyes on all the ways you can handle the conflict.

The next reason that you should ask more than one person for advice is being able to listen to people who have gone through similar situations. People in a group could have gone through similar problems and could tell you what they did and how the outcome turned out. It would be really great for you so that way you can avoid using strategies they used that didn't work out. You can also pick up on the good things they did to handle the problem and use them to your advantage. Overall listening to multiple people who have gone through the same thing can be extremely helpful.

Lastly, I think asking a group of people for advice would be great, so that way you can see how the majority of people respond. If most of the people in a group agree on one way of handling the issue, that probably means you should keep that in mind. A lot of the time, the majority of people can really impact your decision. Listening to what the majority of people say can be a really good tool for you to use when making a difficult choice. Overall listen to what others have to say, and it will really help you out!

It's really necessary to listen to other's opinions when making a tough decision. It's also really beneficial to hear multiple people's thoughts. The benefits of that are hearing different of point of views, listening to people who have gone through similar conflicts, and seeing how the majority of people respond to your issue. So the next time you need to make a difficult decision, don't forget to ask more than one person for advice. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5B14D0F18119,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, Thats because they want to choose the right decision and if they choose wrong, then something terrible could happen, or you will just regret it. Sometimes you question your self and ask ""should I do this or that?"" sometimes you go with your own advice, or you go to a friend or someone. But in my opinion, I think you should always ask a friend, or a family member, for advice even if you think your advice is wiser/better than theirs.

Seeking multiple advice from different people is good because it makes gets you thinking about what to do in that situation like, ""do I do this do I do that!"" so you gather all the advice that you got from the people, you asked and you talk about it see if thats what you want to do, and you do it like I said your advive isn't bad, you just think that the other advice is better, like say you got accepted to two different colleges take your own advice then go get more advice from a family member or a friend, So you got their advice you compare it to yours, and see which one you like more. Seeking advice from other people is good, like I said It helps you with your everyday life.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
23C6ED53A179,"Do you ever find yourself asking for advice or opinions from other people? I know I certainly do, and so do most others I know. Sometimes, gathering a group of opinions can really help someone make a good choice for themselves, which can also help benefit others around them. In this essay, I will be going over two reasons as to why talking to more than one person for advice can help you make a better choice, these reasons being a more majority choice type thing, and the fact that having other people explain other sides of arguments can help you come to a better conclusion of what to do.

The first reason I will be going over is how when you have more people giving you their opinions, the more you will notice one option has more people supporting it. Setting up a poll on an Instagram story or Twitter is a prime example of this. Sometimes, you will see people posting a poll for what they should wear to an event. When that poll is over, you get to see which option got the most votes, and that can help you make your final decision. I have set up polls on Twitter many times trying to figure out what to draw, what music I should listen to, and of course, what color I should dye my hair next. These majority polls have really helped me make decisions in the past, and I will continue to use these polls.

This next reason is more for real life situations, and that is how other's opinions can help you see another side of a story. Sometimes, when someone makes us upset, we tend to lash out and act in ways that we normally wouldn't if we were calmer. After getting in arguments with friends or family members, people will often seek out other people's opinions to figure out what to do. While doing so, those people can also help you realize the other person's side. Me and my grandmother tend to get in arguments a lot where we completely ignore the other person's side of things because of how angry we are. She normally then talks to several members of our family, and I talk to my group of friends, who all offer up advice to help us smooth out the argument. Once the situation has been explained, our little groups calm us down, and then help us realize the other person's side of the argument. Seeing the other side of things can really help choose what piece of advice to go through with.

These are the reasons I believe that asking multiple people for advice can really help you make decisions. Choices in general are very hard to make, especially if you're an indecisive person like I am, so asking other people for help is something I do often. I've received plenty of good advice from when I've had issues with my family or other friends, and with the advice I was given, I was able to make the best choice I could. Even if someone else's opinion is unwanted at the time, later on you can really think about what that person said, and you can choose what to do. I believe that a lot of the good choices I've made in my life are all thanks to my friends, who help me out. Through them and others, I will continue to take advice and make the best choices.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5DC052306F3F,"Making choices can be hard. Whether you don't know what decision to choose from, or you're stuck on a couple of options, asking other people their opinions can be vital to making that decision. Seeking multiple opinions from others can help someone make a better choice because it lets them see from a new perspective, they can learn more about their choices, and asking for multiple opinions can help give you more ideas than just asking one person.

To start off, asking others for their opinion can help someone see from a new perspective. If you're writing a paper, or making a play, asking others for advice and opinions can help appeal to the larger public, and make you seem less bias. Looking from a new perspective can let you see how you sound to your audience.

If you're making something like a big business decision, simply asking others for their view can help you imagine how you would impact others. It can also shine some light on downsides you never noticed, so you can learn to avoid those kinds of decisions in the future.

Furthermore, listening to other people's opinions can help someone learn more about their decision. What I mean by this is, for example, if you wanted to try skydiving for once, you could ask people who have already done it what they think about it. It can help you look at the bigger picture. Asking other people with background experience can help inform you about your decision. Asking people for sources is important too. These sources can help, in a paper, make someone's writing more credible. If someone's making a hard decision, they can check the source and list pros and cons about a decision they aren't exactly sure about yet.

Finally, asking multiple people for their opinions can help spark more ideas. For example, if a family was going on a trip, taking in other people's ideas could help decide where to go, and it can make other people happy with the final decision. Taking a moment to listen to someone's ideas can also narrow down your options. If a college student is having trouble finding a subject they want to major in, they can ask people for ideas, which can inspire them to pursue something they are interested in. Asking other people for insights is better than asking one person. If you're ever feeling lost, asking others can help you whittle down to a few options.

Today's society is one where you can't get anywhere without talking to other people. Humans are social animals, and they can't live without other humans. Making hard decisions is all part of life, and getting through them helps shape who you are. Asking other people to help make a decision is a healthy choice. It can help you see the bigger picture, look at more options-- asking others can help you learn more about certain options, or see how they affect other people. Asking other people for insight is important and it can help make the right choice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
1546CF3CFEEF,"Has anyone ever said to you to not put all of your eggs in one basket? This is similar to asking for one person's opinion and basing everything that you do around that one opinion. Or you could ask a few people their opinion and make an educated guess based on a combination of their opinions and your own opinion. I believe that getting an opinion from more than one person is a great idea because you can see it from everyone else's perspective, have a better understanding of the problem, and be able to look back on what you concluded to help you in the future.

People tend to have varying views on certain topics. For example, if you asked a few random people their opinion on who would be the better president out of all of the candidates running for election, they would have different opinions. But if you listen to why they think that candidate is the best, you may be able to come up with an opinion of your own on the matter. By asking why they think that candidate is the best, they will help you understand their view on the subject. A few people could say that one candidate is the best because that candidate cleaned up their neighborhood for them. On the other hand, someone could say that one candidate was being biased towards the richer neighborhoods and left the other neighborhoods to get worse. Therefore, hearing all sides of an argument is crucial to understanding the topic at hand.

By getting many opinions, you can understand things better. For instance, in Science class you may have been told to draw a conclusion based on a series of tests. This is similar to asking multiple people for their advice, each person's piece of advice is a trial and by running many ""tests"" you can come up with a good opinion. Some of the trials may yield different results compared to other trials, but all of the trials will eventually lead you to a conclusion. So by understanding how others perceive a problem, you can come up with a solid conclusion based on their opinions.

By seeking out multiple opinions from different people in the past, you can use those results to help you in the future. For example, if you had asked all of your past coaches for a school sport what they like to see most in an athlete, you could use their answers and train yourself to be like they said. If they all agree that they like to have players that are coachable, or someone who applies what the a coach says to a game situation, then you would be able to work with yourself to achieve that goal of becoming coachable. By asking for advice now, you can have an opportunity in the future to look back and work with yourself to understand the answers.

Getting an opinion or advice from multiple people helps you to see the problem from other people's perspectives, have a better understanding of the problem at hand, and be able to learn from their advice. Many people make the mistake of not asking for advice when they need it most. Sometimes people will not have the answer you are looking for, but sometimes they might. You will never know if anyone has the opinion you are looking for if you don't ask for advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
871CE2BE3370,"You have a big decision to make, the stress is starting to get to you, you ask your mom for advice but you still don't know what to do!

For years now lots of people have turned for advice but only asked one person. I'm here to tell you that asking more than one person can lead you too a better choice. I believe asking lots of people for help is good because there is no bias, more support, and a clearer mind.

My first reason is, is that theres no bias. This is amazing when getting advice because they don't know the back story. That is great because they don't know about any of the things that are swaying you decision so they can just tell you straight what they think and why. Another thing about bias is that there not in your situation. For example, lets say your asking for advice whether you should switch soccer teams or not. One team will make you more successful but the other you have your friends on, your bias is that you want your friends. If you ask someone else, they would tell you what they think is best for you. Also, if you ask one of your friends on the soccer team with your friends on it for advice, they will have a bias and say that you should come to there team. Thats another reason why you should ask multiple people for advice. My last reason why no bias is good is that bias means being swayed to one side or having clouded judgment. So it's good to ask more than just one person and not just in your family since your family has a close personal connection to you, then bias will be eliminated.

Secondly, there will be more support. This is true because you will have more people to open up to. Let's say that you told people that you were gonna stop smoking and needed advice how, just letting that out and telling people makes your feel like theres more people supporting you. Another reason why more support is good is because there is less stress. There is less stress because if you have more people supporting you, then it's proven to make your feel like you have people on your side. Therefore, that reduces your stress because you don't feel so alone anymore. That leads me to my last reason why more support is good, it's that you won't be as sad. This is great because when you ask people for advice, then you know that they are truly trying to help you. That can help you make a better choice because you feel like everything is more under control and that makes you happier. Just being happier can help you make a better choice because it gets rid of most negative thoughts and helps you think of the pros of the choice and not just cons.

Finally, my last reason why getting multiple opinions on your decision is, that you will have a clearer head. Having a clear head is critical to making a good decision. Asking other people can clear you head because they have a different point of view, so they can help you map out the pros and cons of making the right decision since they might have caught something you missed. That then clears your mind to be able to see all of the aspects of the decision. Having a clear mind also makes your more relaxed which great because it means you wont have any other thoughts clouding your judgment or causing you to be confused. That way when you ask other people for advice you will be able to take it all in and really hear what there trying to tell you. My last reason why having a clear head is good is that it calms you down. Some studies show that when your calm and confident, you will make better decisions. So with being calm, confident, and getting multiple point of views, your sure to make the right choice.

In conclusion, I think that asking more than one person for advice is good because theres no bias, more support, and a clearer head. I personally have made better decisions and choices when I ask lots of other people for advice, not just one. After reading this, are you going to ask more than one person the next time you need advice?",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
88C9F52F748F,"Have you ever wondered why you should get multiple opinions instead of one?

The main reason is to make a better choice, but there is more to it than that.

After asking multiple people for their opinion you can either combine their opinions to make an even better choice, make the choice that most of the people's opinions agreed with, or ask for more opinions so you can boost your chance of finding the opinion that you think is best.

If you do at least one of these after you ask for opinions, you will always make great choices.

The first reason why asking more people for their opinions is because you can combine their opinions to make a better choice.

If you ask four people for their opinions you might only like two of them.

If you can't decide which one is better, you should combine their opinions.

When you do that you don't have to use every single thing they said when making your choice.

For example you can take sixty percent of one and seventy percent of the other because you like some parts of their opinions but not all.

The next one is that when you are making you choice you should think about what the majority of the people said.

For example let's say that you are asking everybody what the best restaurant in town is because you do not know where you want to go for dinner.

About seventy percent of the people you asked say that Bojangles is the best restaurant in town.

Since they have probably eaten in most places in your town you should trust them and go to Bojangles.

No matter what the question is, the right choice to make will probably be what the majority of the people have to say.

The last reason is that the more opinions that you ask for, the better your chance is to find the best one.

My first reason was to combine opinions but that is only if you only like certain parts of different opinions.

When you ask a lot of people for their opinions you might hear one that is just perfect, so you do not need to combine it with another one.

If you want to find this perfect opinion you should ask the wisest people that you can talk to.

When looking for a wise person you should try to find somebody who is older and more experienced because they will know what is right most of the time.

As you may have realized, asking for multiple opinions is way better than asking for one.

When you are trying to make the best choice you should definitely use one of these.

After asking for opinions you should think about these three reasons and think which one would allow you to make the best choice possible.

When you do that there is no way you can go wrong when you are trying to make the best decision possible.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
A5CCD64F5F64,"When seeking for advice you ask more than one person! Some people may ask, their friends, parents or even strangers. Asking for advice you want the best choice for your decision, so you are going to ask more than one person. Why is is seeking multiple opinions better? Talking to more than one person is better because there are different opinions, it could change your decision, and one opinion might suit you decision more.

If someone is asking more than one person for advice, each person they ask is going to have different opinions. For example, if you ask for advice, your friend might say something totally different, to what a stranger might say. People have different view points on different situations. By asking more than one person for advice, will leave the benefit of having more than one view point to choose from. Having to ask more than one person for advice, leads to many benefits.

Asking multiple people for advice outputs the fact that your decision could change. You may ask one person something and then agree with them, but when you ask another person the same question and then agree with them more, or maybe not. Based on the advice a person may give you, could change your mind for a better decision. Asking more than one person for advice may change your decision, and lead to different things when asking for advice.

Just because you ask for advice doesn't mean you have to take their advice. Somebody doesn't have to take advice if they don't like the person's opinion. When asking many people for help, you may ,or may not like their opinion. Someone's advice may suite the situation more to where it suites you more.

883880ACBA01,"People ask other people for advice for many reasons, they are important but, in order to make the right decision, they need time, opinions of others, and they need to, at the end, think it over and see ho it can affect their future.

People ask other people for advice and opinions to make choices, but why? there are many answers, but many people ask because they want to make the right decision or decisions based on other opinions made by other people, or they want to see if the advice or opinions make sense and see if the opinions of others are related to each other. and most important of all, the person who is making the decision should see how the decision would make a difference in their future.

First, time is vital because, the more time you have, you would make the better choice at the end and this can also lead to having more decisions too. for example, lets say that you had a choice of where you would go for college. You would ask other people who have gone to the college, because you want to see what they had to say about it. If you take time to ask them, then you would make a better decision at the end.

another reason why time is important is that, if you do not rush through the decision making process, you would have a lower chance of making mistakes. Time can also help with the factor of not rushing because if you rush, usually you can not take it back even if make a good or bad decision. This leads to a couple of things that you can miss if you rush. lastly you would also have to think things over because once you see a better decision you usually can not take that back either because you have made the choice.

Next, logic is also important for asking advice and opinions from other people, since you can not just go off what you want, because that also would not help you most of the time. you can also tell why other people made their opinion(s), and many other people have logic in their opinions too. To state the obvious you can not make good decisions with a opinions that are outrageous, since they can not help you. logic also requires some common knowledge to make the decision, because you will need common knowledge to separate logical opinions from the ones that are not. Thinking is also tied in to logic too, because some logic does not come naturally to most people, because you have to take the time to think and see if the opinion is logical or not. If it is not, than do not choose it, but if it is, then you can keep that opinion in mind.

when you reach a point where you can not go any farther on gathering advice, it is important to look over the advice and opinions, because you could have missed something but, the most important hing is to predict what could happen in the future.

you should plan out what can happen in the future and you should ask you self ""why does this person have this opinion?"" after you ask you self that you should see how the advice of that person can affect you and see why it good to ask a lot of people. At the end it is good for you to ask other people, because they can also lead you to the best decision, if you ask many people. This can eventually also make you think if the advice from other people is helpful or not to making the best decision. looking over things is also good because, you can tie in all of the logical opinions and advice from others into whole summary, and this can help you conclude what most of the advice and opinions agreed on.

In conclusion, advice from many people is better than just having advice from just one person, because you can have more time to think about it and this can lead to more choices, secondly asking more people for advice and opinions can also help with seeing which opinions make sense and which ones do not and finally if you ask more people, you can look over which opinions are the best. this can also help with the final decision making process, this helps because you can now predict how the advice of others can affect you outcome.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
44B37CB91CF8,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person for different opinions. It is a good thing to ask different people on their advice about a certain topic, because one person might say one thing but it might not be the best advice for you. So if you ask several people you can see what might be right for you to do.

Say you ask one person and you ask them if you should propose to someone and they really don't what your saying and they just say yes. Well if you told him that you just wanted their money and didn't really like the person for who they are. The guy said you should propose so you do and you end up getting divorced. But if you would of asked someone else's opinion they could have told you that you should not be doing this and it wont work out in the end.

Here is some other examples. If you want to know if you should get a certain gift for someone on their birthday it is good to ask people that know the person. Like if their a girl you can ask if they are into dolls or if they really like volleyball and get them a new volleyball to play with. Another example is if your at the store and its your first time shopping for avocados, you want to know which one to buy so you ask the person next to you. they say they prefer their avocado to be hard but still a little soft. You then go ask another person and they say they like theirs hard. You know have an idea on what avocado to get for the next time you go shopping.

F4931416AC4C,"Have you ever had to make a tough decision? I have. I was faced with the difficult decision to quit learning Kathak dance. Kathak was a big part of my life, which is why this decision was so hard, for me to make. So when making this decision I asked many of my family members for advice on what I should do. I believe asking for the advice of my family guided me to make the best decision. When asking for advice seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because everyone has different perspectives, and it allows you to think more about your decision.

Asking multiple people for advice will allow you to get different perspectives on your situation. Everyone has different past experiences, which is why everybody will give you different advice. When asking my family for advice I spoke with my aunt and my grandfather. My aunt was a Kathak dancer, but quit dancing in high school. She believed I should continue to dance because she regretted quitting. My grandfather had no experience in Kathak, but he did play cricket. He advised me to continue dancing because dance kept me active and healthy, which was the same reason he played cricket. Even though they gave me the same advice, they both had different reasons because of their past experiences. Another cause of people having different perspectives is their age. I also asked for the advice of my younger sister Generic_Name. At the time Generic_Name was five years old. Generic_Name thought I should quit dance because she wanted me to be home more often so I could spend time with her. This was a very selfish, and childish answer, but this proves that age does affect perspective. My aunt and grandpa had a different perspectives than my sister because they are older. I believe asking the advice of different people helped me make a better decision because everyone has different perspectives.

Receiving advice from multiple people allows you to think more about your decision. Asking for the opinion of different people may get you conflicting answers. For example when I asked my parents for advice on what to do they both had very different opinions. My mom believed that I should continue to dance. She said dancing was my passion and I would regret quitting. But my dad thought it would be better to quit so I could learn something new. Receiving conflicting advice from my parents really allowed me to contemplate my decision. I also asked for advice from my older cousin Generic_Name. When I talked to Generic_Name she asked me many questions. She asked, ""How will you feel watching your friends perform without you""? ""Will you be able to join classes again if you quit""?

Generic_Name's questions helped me think more about my decision. If I hadn't spoken to Generic_Name I wouldn't have considered those questions. Speaking with multiple people, allows you to think about your decision more.

Asking for advice from multiple people allows you to understand different perspectives, and think more about your choice. The perspectives from my aunt and my grandfather opened my eyes as to the many reasons I should continue dance. Talking to my parents allowed me to contemplate my decision even more because of their conflicting opinions.

Without the advice from all my family members I would not have been able to make that important choice. I believe seeking the advice from multiple people in my family led my to make the best decision to continue to learn Kathak dance.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
798D1DA1BE28,"What would you do if you have a problem? Many people get edvice from some one they trust,but it doesn't always help. I think you should get edvice from multiple people it gives multiple side,experience,and more ways to solve problem.

First,I feel people should get edvice from multiple people because when getting multiple sides to a problem you get multiple points of view. You might ask yo mother something then ask yo father he may have a different feeling about the situation from yo mother,but now you have multiple ways to solve your problem.

Studies show that 85% of people who seeks multiple edivice has a better outcome than people who only seek edvice from one person.

Next,when only getting edvice some people are mor experienced

Some people are better in certain situations. For example Generic_Name is a football player,and his coach to him from quaterback to play cornerback he didn't like that. Generic_Name needs help on what he should do he's going to ask his friends Generic_Name and Generic_Name. Generic_Name is a basketball player,but Generic_Name is a football player who edvice would be the best?

Third, gives multiple ways to solve the problem. If you only ask one person for edvice you don't have that many options to solve yo problem. When asking one peron there edvice is not always the best edvice. For example I am not a good writer and I have a writting test tomorrow i don't know what i should di so i ask my friend,but the edvice she gave me didn't help,and i failed my test. What would have happened if i asked multiple people? maybe if i would have asked other people if her idea didn't work I had other planes.

Some people think it's best to get edvice from one person. When people have a problem they usaully ask someone they trust. When only one person for edvice it doesn't always work out.

People ask more than one person for advice because, they want to see different ways to handle the problem, they want to be able to use the best advice that they're given, and they don't want to get bad advice from one person, use it, and only make the problem even worse.

The reason why, people ask for more than one person for advice is because, they want to be able to handle the problem in the best way possible. And just asking one person, means they could give you bad advice, and you could mess something up real bad. And no one wants that to happen. Asking for two people's advice is better, but what if they both have awful advice? You should stick with at least getting three people's advice on a matter, just to be safe.

People want to get the best advice they could get. Let's say, your friend asked their friend for advice, they gave advice, but it was really bad, would they want to do their advice? No. So they, asked another friend, they gave okay advice, yeah they might want to do that.. but, maybe there's even better advice. So they ask another friend, and they give the best advice yet, they'd want to do that piece of advice right?

People don't want to get bad advice from one person, use it, and make the problem even worse. Let's say your friend took someone else's advice, and it was really bad, but they still used it, because they only asked one person, and things went really badly for them. They would probably stop being that persons friend; if it got really bad. And now your friend is stuck in a even worse problem. Would you want that to happen to your friend? No you wouldn't. But then, say a different friend, asked for yours, their parents, and another friend's advice, and their parents and friend gave pretty decent advice, but you gave them really good advice on what to do, they'd want to do that. And they fixed the problem, they're not stuck in another problem to add, all thanks to your advice, and for talking to more than one person for advice!

These are all great reasons why people should ask for more than one person's advice. But, are you going to be safe? Are you going to ask more than one person for advice? Or are you just going to ask one person, and risk messing up? It's all your choice. But I recommend asking more than one person. And, just remember, always ask more than one person for advice!

What sports teams to try out for, what classes to take, and where to go to college are all big decisions in a person's life. Getting multiple peoples' responses will help with decision making by seeing the issue from other viewpoints, avoiding mistakes that have already been made, and reaching the most unbiased consensus.

To one person, a choice can sometimes seem only black and white, however getting advice from others can change this. Each person who is asked will have different experiences and biases affecting the advice they will give. People also play different roles in society, and those roles yield other viewpoints that would not have otherwise been considered. Discussing decisions with peers will bring more sides to an issue, and, in turn, help the person make a more informed choice.

Along with adding viewpoints, avoiding mistakes that have already been made will be achieved by talking with others. Some may have faced similar problems and can share the positives and negatives of each side. Along with this, personal experiences may show one decision will have many other consequences that were not previously taken into account. After reaching a final decision, the choice made will have less unpredicted side effects and it will avoid bad decisions that have been made by others in the past.

As well as seeing topics from other sides and avoiding similar mistakes, discussing choices with friends will produce the least biased decision. Each person asked will have a different opinion and bias on a subject based on prior events. If only one person is consulted, their bias may have a larger effect on the outcome, but something that happened to that person may not apply to that situation. The more people that are asked, the more clear it will be on which outcomes are common, and should be most avoided.

Choices can affect people for a long time and in order to make sure the best decision is being made, it is necessary talk with other people. Getting new advice will add different viewpoints, help avoid similar mistakes that have been made in the past, and bring people to a less biased agreement. Seeking many opinions can help someone make the best choice for them.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
6DD72D0584FA,"I believe that what the statement means is that you may want to talk to more than one person for advice because you might hear two different things. If you just asked one person they might have a different opinion than the other person. and if you truly want advice you would ask more people because some people have more advice to offer you than another person.

Also it is good to ask more than one person because lets say you had to fix something and the first person you asked has a decent solution but if you asked more than one person the second person might have a better solution to fix your problem. Same with the news,the news is bias most of the time so listing to two news broadcast about the same story would probably be your best bet on getting information on the story. Another thing about advice is you have to ask the right people about something like if you asked a criminal for advice and then a cop you would hear two different stories.

Also another reason why people ask for advice from more than one person is simplie because they want to get all the information they can get out of others so that they will now know something that they did not know before. like for instance if you were struggling with something in class you would probably ask a classmate to help you out and then you would ask the teacher in the room for help so then you can stop struggling in that class.

another example for advice is the president the president appoints a group of people in his cabinet to give him advice on what they should do next and on how to deal with issues at hand.

same with sports the athletes have coaches that give them advice on how to get better at a game and they have teammates that will also give them advice on how to get better. Same with soldiers in war if they were pinned down behind cover they will probably talk among each other and think of a plan to get themselves out of danger. Also when The FBI has to do a mission they would ask each other for advice before they make a move into completing the mission. I recommend when you ask advice ask people you know like friends and family because you would get an actual answer.

normally people would ask an older person for advice because they have been alive longer and know a lot more than you and have also probably been threw a lot more than you have. Thought advice is good to ask for make sure you ask the right people for advice because some people might not have good advice and miss inform you about something and then someone might ask you about it and then you would spread miss information without even knowing it which leads to that person you just miss informed without knowing to spread what they just learned in conclusion it is a good thing to ask more than one person for advice because you will get to different answers and one might be better than the other but it also depends on who you ask because if you ask something political going on you would get a bias answer and also always ask people you trust for advice because those people would give you a better answer than some random person you asked.

those are reasons why people ask more than one person for advice

B87D59512568,"Asking for advice is a crucial part of making a big decision. Many people ask for second opinions when they don't know what they should do, or can't decide on their own. When you as a decision maker do this, it benefits you by giving you a chance to learn from the experience of others, view your situation in a different perspective, and learn more about your choices. All of these are valuable assets that will help you later in life, and maybe even help others if they come to you for advice. Experience is one benefit that definitely will help later on.

The main reason everyone asks for a second opinion is for experience. People who have had to make your decision before will have experience with what happened to them when they made the decision. This will help you try to find the result that will best benefit you. My friend Generic_Name always asks for the opinion of others when trying to make a decision. A great example of this is when she couldn't take a important test, but didn't know when she should make it up. She asked me what she should do, and I told her that when I missed a big test, I tried to find a solution with our teacher beforehand, like taking the test early, or a few days after the actual test date. Generic_Name knew she couldn't take the test early, as she had another activity taking up her time, but she went to our teacher and asked if she could take it later. Generic_Name figured out a solution by asking others for advice, and found the best choice for her using my experience. Now, she can also use both mine and her experience to make decisions later on inn life. Using my experience to find a solution is not the only way for Generic_Name to solve her problem though. She could have asked for a different perspective instead.

Advice from others come in many forms, but most come in the form of a different perspective. Different perspectives help others understand your problem so they can help you, and also you can now rearrange the pieces of your situation to find a solution. It's always better to look at your choices in a new perspective, because you might find it easier to choose the best one for you from that angle. When I was trying to decide which sleep-away camp I wanted to attend this summer, I had to ask my parents and my friends to decide. My parents told me that because one of the camps was extremely expensive, it would be better for me to go to the other one. My friends, on the other hand, told me that instead of choosing one or the other, I should go to a completely different camp, one that has the activities of both previous camps mentioned and cost less than each one. I did not know about this camp, and didn't even consider trying to find a camp with the benefits of both the ones I wanted to attend. But using my friends' wider perspectives, I was able to find a completely new and customized solution for me. They also could have provided important information about the new camp that I was not aware of to advise me on my decision.

Information is a big asset when making a decision, and you can get that information by asking for advice from others. Different people may know certain things about the decision that you need to make. Asking for advice from these people will allow you to gain this information and make a better choice. A study from Harvard University found that when given the choice, 99% of people chose to make a decision with advice from multiple strangers who has had to make the same decision before. Out of that 99%, 98% believed that the choice they made was the best for them. They also believed that the knowledge they gained from talking to the strangers was a big contributing factor to their success. This study shows how truly beneficial advice from others is. It not only helped people make the best decision possible, but also provided new information for the decision maker, who can now pass on that knowledge to others who need help from someone with experience.

In conclusion, when making a decision, asking for multiple opinions is extremely beneficial. You can learn from the experience of others, choose the right choice more easily when looking at different solutions in a new perspective, and gain new information you can pass on to others, thus helping the whole process come full circle. It will benefit you greatly in the long run as well, as you can use anything you gain from these different opinions in future decision making processes. Clearly, it is always better for you to ask for a second opinion, no matter the decision.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
D24777F39289,"Asking for advice is one of the main subjects that is not touched on as other subjects. Advice can help a human grow mentally and physically. Asking more than one person for advice gives options for whats right or wrong in anybodies opinion. Advice is getting support when you are not sure how handle or fix a problem. Many people ask for advice from friends, doctors, therapist, parents, siblings, you can get advice from anybody that you feel comfortable with. Therefore, Advice can benefit you emotionally and mentally, helps with later decisions in life, and develops you to ask for help when you need it.

It can be hard and easy to ask for advice, but it's worth seeing different perspectives and opinions from multiply people that you trust. This can help later in life when you can make decisions for yourself and decide on what you think is good for this problem, and make a effective solution.

Or will it make me regret it for this rest of my life? It's not easy to make these decisions, but it helps to know what you can do with your information. ""Make dew."" is a popular saying, meaning to work it out, you will know what's right and wrong, because you control what happens with you and your future.

Traumatic events happen, even if you do not appreciate it happening, or even if the chances are dramatically low. It can still occur, and you cannot avoid it. This can be very emotional or devastating for a lot of people, going to doctors and therapist can help you get through it when asking for advice. Its their job to be there for you and people just like you. Telling them how you feel will make you feel better, even if its just the slightest it can make a difference, and that just happens when they are just sharing their opinion and being there for you. Connecting with other people with experience like you can help. Asking for their advice can help as well, because it can be similar traumatic events that both participants have gone through. It won't be easy, but it makes you grow as a person and letting go of the feelings and share. Doctors, therapist, and people with similar events, will not have the same exact opinion or advice, it does not mean they are wrong.

The more you ask for something, the better. You get better at getting what you prefer out there, instead of keeping it to yourself and regretting it later. Asking for help is major, its okay to ask for help, its okay to feel uncomfortable when you do ask for help. Its not going to be easy for everyone. That's why we have so much leadership in our life, thats why parents, friends, doctors, grandparents, are here for your help. They are here for your back support. If you can't tell your own parents that something wrong is going on, it can be difficult for you. Therefore, practice and don't be afraid, because it's your parents job to make you feel better, and help you to get on the right track.

Advice helps you learn and feel good about yourself. It helps with relationships, projects, school, stress, goals, occupation, and lastly life. Advice will be always be around for you to use. Asking for ideas and direction will make you stronger, wiser, and can make people trust you for advice. Help is not something you should be afraid of. You embrace it. Asking for help does not make you're weak, it makes you feel better. Not asking for help doesn't mean you're strong and doesn't make you smart either. Why would you ask multiply people for advice or help? It helps with communication and decision making, helps with mental and emotional health and state, and develops you to ask for more advice when you feel like it is needed.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
3127E2B3B68A,"Asking others for advice is like studying before the night of a test; it is a fantastic idea! When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Asking many different others for advice is a wonderful idea, for it can boost ones confidence, gives you more than one opinion, and be less stressful.

To begin with, asking others for advice is a marvelous idea, for can boost confidence. It may help you feel very good about the decision you are going to make, also if you ask others and they give good feed back on your decision. There will be many times where people you ask for advice on may tell you that you are picking the right choice. For example, my younger brother is playing basketball for a travel team. On this team they have an A team which is good and the have a B team which is not as good. My brother was placed on the B team and he wants to woke hard and be able to get on the A team, with him having many different others to support his decision that will boost his confidence and he will want to do better.

Another reason why asking others for advice on something is good is, for it gives you more than one opinion. You can get many different perspectives from this, you can see what they would do and what they would not encourage. You can also see the many different options you may have during the situation, and you can decide on what is best for you. For example, if your mother told you to clean up and you do not want to and you ask more than one person for advice on what you should do. The many different people may advise you that cleaning up is the best decision to make in this situation.

The last reason on why i think asking others for advice is the best decision is because it can be extremely less stressful. You do not have to stress for days or even hours on what the best decision is when you can ask others for advice. You also do not have to think the situation is all on your hands and that you can not deal with it. For example, say your school loaned you a computer and a charger for it at the beginning of the year. It is coming to the end of the year and you lose your charger the day before you are supposed to turn it in. This situation has became very stressful and you may not know what to do, but you can ask others for advice and you can make the best choice on when you will buy another charger.

However, while many people ask for advice from other people to make the best decision, many other people would rather not ask for any advice at all. Not asking for others advice can be good, for you do not second guess yourself or your decision, it shows your independent and do not need others input, and shows you can keep everything under control without people telling you what you should do.

In conclusion, people all around the world recommend asking others for advice and sometimes it is the best choice to do in some cases, for it boost confidence, gives more than one opinion, and causes less stress. I personally think that asking for ones advice helps you make a better choice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
15FD5B635B50,"Did you know 67 percent of people talk to more than one person for advice. They do that because different people might have different views of the situation. Although some people experienced the situation. The advice might be useful for other people too. It can help them agree with the choice or decision they will make.

One reason why some people might ask more than one person for advice is people might have different views of the situation. Some people will have an idea of what to do and some people won't. Some people might tell you to do wrong things. Some people might not know what your going through therefore they will give you bad advice. Some people will know what they are doing so they will give you good advice.

Secondly why people ask more than one person is some people have experienced it or gone through it. They might know what will happen. They might know what you will see and go though during the experience because they probably gone through it.

Finally why people ask more than one person is to make sure that their doing it right or successfully. To make sure that they know what they are doing. To ask their opinions to see if they are thing as you are. To see if you agree with them. They might have a lot in common with with about the situation.

In conclusion why people ask multiple people for their opinions is to see their points of view and to make sure of what you are doing. The people you ask may have experienced it the thing they are going through",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
7B751C9BE162,"When you are seeking for advice, why do you often find yourself asking multiple people for their opinions? What is so beneficial about asking multiple people for their opinions on a topic they may not know much about? How does it help you make a better choice? I can answer that question for you.

When seeking for advice is can be about anything, family, friends or just general decision making. Let's come up with an example, Generic_Name was friends with a group of kids since childhood, she starts to lose touch with them and realizes how much she needed them in her life but she doesn't know how to approach them or talk to them anymore. she decides to ask her older brother for advice, he tells her that she shouldn't even try but if she really wanted to then she should

""just be straight up with them"". Her brother only says this because he dislikes some of Generic_Name's friends and finds them annoying. She doesn't really like that idea so she decides to ask someone else for their opinion. The way everyone problem solves and views things is different, not everyone has the same mindset which is why its important to hear multiple point of views.

When someone knows less about a situation it is sometimes better because they see everything from an outside perspective creating a less bias opinion or neutral opinion. When you ask multiple different people for advice on one topic, you are searching for a general opinion/ idea or a pattern in what people have to say to then influence your decision. If you chose not hear from a few people one persons opinion may be bias and can heavily influence your decision in a good or bad way. Hearing many different sides can help you come to a better conclusion of your own because you can then weigh out the pros and cons of your situation. Everyone's point of view will be different like that of your 13 year old friend who is your age and knows you very personally or of your 72 year old grandmother. Your friend may know you well but your grandmother has lived longer as has possibly experienced the same things you are currently experiencing. Each has its own benefit and can help add onto your thought process.

You make better choices when you have the opportunity to properly think things through. In order to do that you have to give your self time. When talking to different people you are forcibly giving your self that time to process and think about what your next move will be. This gives you a clearer mind and opens up a better way of seeing things. After that like I have stated before, you can use other peoples opinions to build off of your own. It also imperative to look at all angles of your situation because you may not being seeing important factors that can help you problem solve that someone else may see.

In conclusion, there are many reasons as to why should always ask more than one person when seeking for advice on an issue. Not only will you be building your knowledge on how to deal with those kind of situations but you are also learning how to put together ideas to form your own. Asking multiple people will push you to think more and create a well thought out plan. You also learn not rely on one specific person just in case their opinion is bias when it comes to a certain topic. That is why I believe that seeking advice from multiple people can help you make a better choice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
1BC811EC52DD,"Not everyone thinks the same way, if you ask someone for their opinion and they suggest one thing, not everyone will agree with what they suggest. However if you ask more than one person for their opinion, you will get a better idea of what people want and like. If you can only buy one shirt but have two shirts you like, you could ask your friends. Assuming you have good friends they will give you their honest opinion. You can than then buy the shirt that most of your friends suggest.

Getting multiple opinions can make you happier. Your friends know you very well and will sometimes know what you want before you even know what you want. A lot of your friends can make big decisions for you because they know what you want. If you want to get a hair cut, but have no idea how you want to get it cut, ask some of your closest friends. They can give you a great idea that will make you happy.

It can also reduce stress in your everyday life. If you don't know what you should buy, or what type of clothing to wear ask people for their opinion. You can then take their opinion and buy what they suggest. You won't have to worry about fitting in because you are using peoples opinions, since it's what they like and think they won't make fun of you and stress you out.

You shouldn't only ask your friends for opinions though, you should ask your family. Your family should know more than your friends do about you. In most cases you have lived with your family for many years and spent most of your life with them. They know everything there is to know about you, and know what would make you happy down to the tiniest detail. They will also give you their honest opinion like;whether or not they like an outfit, if a hair cut works on you, whether or not a jobs a good fit for you, if a friend is a good influence on you, and much more.

It's also important to not only ask people for their opinion and do what you want to do and get what you want to get. No matter how well people know you, you know yourself best. Don't start only doing what other people want just to fit in. Be different and do what you want.

Not everyone wants what's best for you, people you think you are close to and trust might give you bad advice on purpose so you make a bad decision. Make sure you can completely trust the people whose opinions you get so you don't make a bad choice.

Getting multiple opinions can change the smallest things in your everyday life, ranging from your hair cut to the type of car you buy. It will make your overall life happier. However it's important to not let other peoples opinions take away from what you want and make you less of yourself. Don't only ask people for their opinion, pick things out for yourself nobody can make decisions for yourself better than you.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
FDD7D9AA0940,"Hey Generic_Name I said, ""i need help i'm stuck in this problem right now."" Generic_Name answered and said, ""what's up."" I said, ""i need help i'm trying to get a job but i don't know where i should work."" Generic_Name said, ""just go work at Generic_Name because they give benefits."" i agreed with him and went home. later that day i ask my mom and said, ""mom i need advice where should i work.""

She said, ""Generic_Name because its a great first job to have as a teenager."" Getting advice from more people is good because, It could bring more ideas that you didn't know about, it can help you to make the right decision, and it can help you because others could have experience from your problem.

My first topic is it can help you because it could bring new ideas about the advice you need. when i was asking Mom and Generic_Name where i should work they both gave me new ideas about Generic_Name. My mom said, ''that it's a great first job for a teenager.'' which it is because it shows me how to be responsible with my time learn how to save money and so much more. Generic_Name told me that they give benefits which i didn't know. So if i work there i get benefits like a little of my college payed for . Now i got 2 new ideas about working at Generic_Name i think i want to work there.

My second topic is it can help you with making the right decision. Like my friend Generic_Name need help because he wanted to ask this beautiful girl out but didn't know if he would get rejected or not. ''Generic_Name"", called Generic_Name i need your help i wanna ask Generic_Name out but i don't know if she likes me. Generic_Name said, ''dude she totally likes you i have seen her stare at you before and she keeps checking you out.'' Generic_Name said, ""Thank you.'' and walked off. Generic_Name later that day ask Generic_Name and said ''do you think Generic_Name like me or no."" Generic_Name said, ""she 100 percent likes you i have seen her look you up and down."" Generic_Name said ''thank you'' and walked away. Later that day he built up the courage to go ask her out. As Generic_Name was walking he's hands started sweating and he became nervous but he said, Generic_Name will you go out with me"" and she said yes. that why asking other people for advice can help you because if Generic_Name didn't ask Generic_Name or Generic_Name he wouldn't have asked out Generic_Name.

My final topic is that asking people for advice could help you because they might have experienced it before you did. I was running home from school and ran into my neighbors garden. i didn't know if i should tell them or not so i asked my sister and said, ""Generic_Name i ran into Mrs. Generic_Names garden should i tell her or no."" she said, ''i would tell because if she finds out you did it and you didn't tell her she going to be mad and i know she would because i ran into her garden too awhile ago and I didn't tell her and she found out and i got in more trouble."" So i walked up so scared that Mrs. Generic_Name was going to be so mad but she open the door and i told her that i ran into her garden and she was upset but happy i told her. that's why asking advice is good because other people might have done the same thing but did the wrong choice.

In conclusion i got the job, got my friend to date the girl he liked and didn't get in trouble with Mrs. Generic_Name because i asked people for advice. so that's why getting advice from other people is good because it could help with new ideas, it can help you make the right choice, and it can help you because other people might have experience it before.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
070413F48F80,"Advice

Many people have hard times making decisions, so what do they do, they ask for peoples advice to find out what the best idea that they can use.

We ask people advice everyday like do you think I should wear blue or red, maybe even do you think I should find a new job and quit my old one. Eventhough not everything we ask is in need of advice or an opinion.

People tend to ask more then one person for advice because many people have different perspectives and ideas on how the problem could be solved.

It's also probably a better way to figure out what your going to do because your original plan could've not been solved how you wanted, and things end up getting worse but that why you ask someone for their opinion.

Another benefit from getting multiple opinions and ideas from other people you can also take little bits and pieces from each persons respond to help solve your problem.

Asking family and friends for advice is always a great way to have someones help but your might not be able to talk to them which is why therapist are always another option because their professional help could help solve whatever may be going on.

You could also if you don't wanna talk to just one person go to a form of group therapy for whatever is going on because talking to others who have gone through the same thing may help you to be able to talk about your problems.

You could even talk to a school counselor if you don't wanna pay for sessions while talking to a therapist if your in high school or middle school.

Advice can come in many different forms like I said from family, friends, counselors and therapist.

You can also have an online therapist if you don't wanna talk face to face with someone.

From what I said before advice can help you or whom ever may need the advice or someone opinion may help that person make the right choice instead of a bad one, but it may also depend on how the person receives the advice because we all have different minds ad a way of thinking.

Asking people for advice is a common thing and we all do it daily because we can ask for opinions about almost everything but sometimes we don't to because it just doesn't need to.

Although sometimes people don't ask for advice or someones opinion because they don't know which why it's easier to talk to friends and family for certain thing and then with something else that's where you can talk to a therapist or counselor. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
BF7DA06D503F,"When people face a problem or are in need, they generally seek outside opinions to help them tackle their issues. Receiving multiple of these opinions is very beneficial for many reasons and in many cases it can be crucial to finding the best answer. It can eliminate false statements and incorrect facts that one person may give you, it can eliminate bias from one side, and it can be important in finding the best answer for the problem, as having more minds being put into a problem gives a higher chance that the best answer will come out.

By getting more than one opinion on a problem, the person asking can be assured that they are avoiding bad or false statements and facts. One person may be incorrect or may have low amounts of knowledge on the topic at hand. This can lead to big problems later on down the road for the person seeking the advice. However, getting more opinions on the topic can help in finding the correct facts, and quickly pushes out the few peoples ideas who have a bad understanding of the topic. For example, when I was younger I accidentally broke a necklace that my mother loved a lot. I was extremely worried that if I told her I would get in huge trouble, and I had no clue what to do. At first, I asked my older sister what to do, thinking she might have had a past experience with such an issue. She recommended to me that I should just hide the necklace, and pretend to not know where it was when asked by my mom. This seemed wrong to me, but I wasn't sure, so I sought other opinions. First, I asked some of my friends, and they instead recommended that I just tell the truth and tell her about how I accidentally broke her necklace. I wasn't sold yet on this opinion either, so I decided to ask one more person, my older brother. I then explained to him the situation, and he instantly reassured me on what my friends had said. He told me to tell her what had happened, and that she wouldn't be too mad as he knew that she could fix the necklace and would appreciate my honesty. In the end, it turned out my brother and my friends were correct. By doing what they said I avoided as much trouble as possible, and my mom got to have her necklace. By seeking multiple opinions I ended up with the safest and best answer possible. Seeking multiple opinions not only avoids bad or false statements, but it also avoids bias.

Bias has become an increasingly strong issue in our country and in our people. Bias can be very detrimental to people who are seeking outside opinions on an issue, and may steer them down the wrong path. Someone with extreme bias on a topic may have clouded judgment on what the true facts and details on an issue are, making their opinion untrustworthy. Seeking multiple opinions, especially opinions from both sides of an issue are key in avoiding bias, as seeing both sides of the equation makes it easier to find a middle ground. For example, when people search to find the best presidential candidate, they will find extremely biased answers from both sides of the media. In order to find the best answer to the question of voting, voters must look at both sides, democratic and republican, to find the best answer for who should be the nominee. By simply viewing republican or democratic media, the voter will experience extreme bias and a sub par answer to the question of who really is best fit for the job. This is why getting multiple opinions and statements from both sides allows the voter to find the best answer for who will be the strongest candidate for the presidency. This shows how getting multiple opinions eliminates bias from a topic, but attaining more opinions and putting more heads together to solve an issue can also be critical in getting the best answer, and not just the correct one.

Finding not only the correct but also the best solution to a problem is key in some situations. In order to do this, the person seeking the best answer must get outside opinions on the topic. Putting more heads together to think about ways to solve a problem has been proven to produce the strongest answers possible. This proof can be shown in a 2016 study done by Dr. Williams of Harold-Webster University. Some things listed in the study showed that groups found better and more sustainable answers to problems that they were given than people who were working with only one other person on the same topic. The numbers were staggering, as the groups of people had a 95.7% success rate in finding the best possible solution, while the people working with only one other person only had a 60% success rate in finding the best solution to the same issue. The study concluded that groups of people were way more efficient and successful than the other people who worked on the same topic with a partner. The study went as far as to recommend the practice of getting others opinions and working in groups to it's readers. This clear benefit in getting advise from multiple people to solve problems has inspired top scientists to collaborate with others on their work. Even the president must find outside opinions, such as when he consults his advisers or when he calls a special session of congress to talk things over. This clear benefit of multiple opinions is what the very principle of democracy was founded on, and makes up our United States politics and ideals today. Getting the best answer on a topic is just one of many good reasons to get multiple opinions to help solve a problem.

Overall, seeking multiple opinions is a great way to find the best and most efficient answers to a problem. This method of problem solving is great as it avoids bias and can easily rule out bad opinions that use false facts. While asking only one other person for advise can be good, it can also be flawed and can be risky, and it never hurts to just ask a few more people. Collaboration allows for multiple minds to work together, and it allows humans to do what they are best at, being social creatures.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
8FEC3A849513,"Advice is really something you shouldnt take. Advice can we great but the total opposite of what you wanted to hear. People often times give you bad advice as well, so you really should seek out more than one person an opinion on the topic at hand. Seeking multiple persons for advice can often lead you to an overlooked detail ,or a different outcome of the situation.

So say one of my friends decided to jump off of a cliff, but they want to know which cliff and how to safely do it. So I told them they shouldn't do it, but someone else told them a specific place and to bring a parachut. Then they ask another person and they also agree that they shouldn't jump off of a cliff. In that senario another person and me convinced my friend not to jump off of a cliff. I also managed to teach him the lesson on getting advice from multiple people, because the same guy who told him to jump off of a specific place with a parachut fell to his death because the parachut didn't catch the air and tangled.

Another example of taking advice from oher people would be the ,not so great, explorer Christopher Columbus. He took advice from probably over a thousand people not to set sail, because people knew that the earth was infact round and not flat. Everyone knew that the distance from India from Europe was over thousands of miles, but he didn't listen until the king and queen of Spain said okay on the explorers plans. He was a fool who couldn't do correct math and ended up discovering the Bahamas ,and slautered every native on those islands. If he had just listened to the mass of people trying to stop him from sailing he wouldn't have ""discovered"" the Americas and slaughtered over 30 thousand people.

I wanted to write a book about fantasy, but I lacked the creative fuction to put my story on the board. So I contacted my friends and strangers in the streets to ask what I should make my story about. Taking their advice I wrote a million dollar best seller that over took The Hobbit in popularity. All because I asked people what they would've wanted in a fantasy book. The opinions of others might even help me write a book, do something daring, or even just what movie to watch. That is the power of asking others for advice.

Advice can often lead to dangerous situations and even not be that great. That is why I should always ask for a second opinion ,and not just go off and do what one person told me. Weither it be an idea for how to start an essay or even what to eat tonight. Advice can be dangerous, but can be exactly what you wanted to hear or the opposite. The opinion of others can make me do wonders i never thought possible.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
FFA381E58FC6,"Some people may ask multiple people for advice. This can be for many reasons. For many people they don't like only asking one person for advice because somebody might give better advice than someone else, also people have different views and opinions on things.

Advice is something that can impact a persons view in many ways. It can be helpful or harmful depending on what you say.

Speaking to more than one person to get advice can impact you positively, someone can use everything that many people said and use it to help them. Somebody might ask for an opinion of how they look, or what someone thinks of something.

The person that wants an opinion might want to ask many people because they want to know what is better to do, use, or wear. People always ask for an opinion. Some people do things based on someones' advice because they think it will be better or make the other person happy. In conclusion asking for an opinion can be beneficial to someone. ",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
4E6F19F29DA9,"People ask multiple people for advice because you get different kinds of answers, like some advice can help you and some advice can not help you. Their are two kinds of advises people can give you.

Getting different types of answers from people are very helpful, lets say that you got into trouble and had to deal with consequences then the principal said "" I'm going to give you advice, next time stay out of trouble and think about what you do before you show action"". That is good advice so you will not do the same thing you did last time, most advice that help people will not help you and you might do it again.

Whether, you get advise from people think about it first because you know when it does no help you or it does not feel like the right advise for you, lets say you end up in trouble again but this time someone tells you to talk back or smack that person, that is advise you do not want to listen to because you will learn from it.

Multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, like getting advice from lots of people will help you, like if you want to do the right thing and do what is best for you, you will have to get advise from multiple people because it is not as easy as you think it is.

Why do people ask more than one person is because other people have different advise and opinions from other people.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
0CF568439ADB,"Have you ever been given bad advice or not get any advice at all and regret it. Maybe you should have gotten more advice from more people. I always think it is a good idea seek advice from more than one person. Though that is just my advice you might want to hear from someone else.

getting advice from more than one person could keep you from doing something bad. This could be if you want to make a big purchase like a car. It would definitely be a good idea to ask people for advice. Also definitely ask more than one person because thee will always be bad experience with everything and you just might ask that person who had one of those few bad experience. But if you ask more than one person you will get more than one view and opinion.

Asking different people can give you more options on what to do. Some people may just have more experience than others and give better advice. Say you wanted to build a table you might ask people for advice on how to do it. So if you as ten people for advice then you may get people that have more experience than if you just asked the one. So if out of those ten people two make table for a living you might not have asked those two people and not have gotten the expert advice. Those other eight people might not have given bad advice they just might not have given the best advice.

Getting advice from more than one source could keep you from doing something dangerous. For example I am a wood worker and it is my hobby if I am looking on how to make a certain cut someone might give you a dangerous practice that they use all the time. So if you only trust that one person you could get hurt badly. If you just take the extra time to ask more people's opinion you will get told that is dangerous and not to do that. The other person that you ask might give you a better way to do that or tell you about some one that you should ask for more advice.

So yes it will always be the best idea to seek more people for advice. These are my reasons for why that is. Some people may disagree that is fine it is just an opinion. It can just never hurt to ask more than one person.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
765FE8D30F1A,"All around the world, people say their opinions that may be right or may be wrong. Advice is someone's opinion, or it means their thoughts on the way they view something. They can be biased, or their opinions can be based off of something. Although some may be bad, others may be good. Many people should talk to more than one person for advice because it will give them a better chance at having the best advice, they have more options to choose from, and they can see if anyone can put up a good argument to get convinced.

Getting more than one of the same advice may make you feel like they are right, and they, most likely, could be right. There is a better chance of it being a good choice than being a bad choice, hypothetically speaking, because if more than one person says the same thing over and over again, it should be one of the best choices. Talking to people for advice is just like a science experiment. When scientists are testing an experiment, they do it multiple times to assure them that they got the most accurate data. That is almost the same way in this case. When people ask more than one person for advice, they are seeking that one advice that most people tend to say for the best answer. Having multiple of the same advice, most likely, could be the best choice.

Another reason why going to more than one person is a good thing is because having more than one advice will give you a variety of choices to choose from. People will give their advice, and they can range from best to worst, but the one that's asking, is the one that's choosing. Whichever feels the best for them. For example, you want to go out for dinner, but you don't know where to go. You go to people for advice on where to go, and some say you should go to the Golden Corral buffet, others say the McDonalds restaurant, and the rest say the In n Out restaurant. The best part about asking for advice is it is your decision to choose where to go, not theirs. You can pick the one advice that feels the best out of all of the rest and fits your needs.

Lastly, asking more than one person for advice will give you an insight on people's views and, you can, possibly, get convinced. You can find which argument was the best supported and choose it. It may just be one person who said the advice, but if it is convincing well-enough, that's great. Some advice can seem like the best choice but without any reason why it is, how can someone be sure enough that it is? Asking more than one person for advice will help in this situation because you can get convinced to take a better and different advice along the way.

The benefits of talking to more than one person for advice is it will give you an advice that has a higher percentage at being a good choice, you will have more options to choose from, and you can see if anyone can put up a convincing, well-enough argument. Some opinions have to do with experience. That is why it could be the best or worst choice for you. You're not obligated to take their advice. Choosing the best advice can be hard, but it's better for you to go to more than one person for advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
708226E85CD6,"I think asking other people for help is a good idea especially asking several people. When asking more than one person for their own opinion it make's you look at the situation in different view points. If you need advice for something one person might say something completely different from what you thought of. Where somebody else might say what exactly you were thinking. When asking several people for the same advice or their opinions it will make you not only think more about the subject but it also helps you with different view point. One person will have a negative side to it and the other person will have a positive side to it so you would be able to think what's the worst that could happen or what's the best that could happen.

Personally I think it's better to ask more than one person, because you might be going through something and somebody gives you their advice, it almost is like they give you their strength to do it. I think as an example: say you are getting bullied, but you dont wanna tell on them because you are scared. You might go to a friend and ask for advice and you friend might say you need to tell on them, because if you tell on them they will stop but if you don't tell on them, they will continue to do it. If you have advice to do it from a friend more than likely you will go and tell on the bully or whatever your scenario is.

In my personal opinion helping somebody else always may not only make you feel good but it also helps your friend once their problem is solved or at least been helped. When asking for advice, or somebodies opinion it could really help you out. When asking one person for their opinion might not help you as much as asking several people for their opinion. When asking several people for their opinion, it helps you a lot more by not only giving you extra help but by making you think harder and look at it in different ways.

Asking your friend for their own opinion might not always be good because some people make bad decisions and might tell you to do something that will get you in trouble. In this situation you have to look at the pros and cons to the subject or to what they told you for their opinion or advice. If you think about what they told you if it was good it might and probably will help you. There so, when asking somebody something always think about it before you do it. I always think about what I do before I do it, because if somebody gives you advice that might get you in trouble and or put you in a bad place to get hurt or even worst that would be your fault in the end.

When somebody is asking you for help or is asking for advice they want you to help them. The person giving advice wants what is best for you so always go with what they said once you explain your situation or what you want. I would ask the person first and say why do you give that advice, or why do you say that, or why is that your opinion and see if they can back up their answer with a good reason. If they can give a good reason than I would go for it to do what is best for me. Also if it would help then go ahead and do what you need to do to get the problem over with or whatever your situation is.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
23F0ABEF8370,"Somepeople ask different people for their opinion. Because if you ask different people,people can have different opinion and they can have multiple answer.

First,people have different opinion. When people ask different poeple,people have multiple answer. For examole when i want to buy a pair of shoes i ask my mom, my dad, and sometimes i ask people that i do not know, but different people help me to see witch pair of shoes i should pick and there i can see what pair of shoes are the best. somepople do not like to know what other said when i think is better when everybody said their opinion

To continue,listen other opinion of different people make to choice better. Listen different opinion help us to know what other people think about it. For example my friend always ask me how she looks, so she want to know my opinion, and she dont only ask me. She ask different people to know their opinion. In the world are 58% of people who want to know other people opinion and their is 52% of people who do not care about what other people think about them. People want to know what other people think. Because that is how people can help to choice the best one. My opinion is that knowing what other people think help us to know more the other person think.

Finally, let people expres their opinion. If people know opinion of different persons,help us to pick better. For example sometimes i want to buy a pencil but i like two pencil, but i only have money for one. Their is when i need somebody to tell me witch one i should pick. I always tell somebody to tell their opinion. Because their is how people can expres theirself, and tell them that is cute or not. Instagram,instagram is a social media that a use for a lot of time,instagram sometimes help me. Because sometimes when i dont know witch one to pick, i post in my storie, i put .""What shoes i should to pick."", and their is when my frieds vote for what shoes i should pick, and i can make the best desition. I love to know what other people opinion because that help me to know what other people think about me.

In conclusion,my opinion is that every person in the world need to listen other person. Because if people have multiple opinion, people can have the better choose.

2438536A9907,"People don't always make the right choice. Peoples opinions influence your decision making. Hearing another persons point of view is helpful. In your mind you have little voices that have an affect on your decisions. In my opinion, I like having more than one choice. Whenever I have to make an important decision I go and ask my friends for their opinion on the situation. I have been through some situations where I needed help from someone to help me decide what choice i should make. Peer pressure is a good example on making good choices. Imagine your in a room full of kids older than you, They ask you ""come try this drink"". You know your not old enough to be drinking, yet you still ask your friends if you should do it or not. All of your friends tell you ""No"" ,so you decide not to do it. Deciding on certain things isn't easy.

By getting someone else's point of view, You can look at things in a different way. If you don't ask for an opinion their could be a chance you could've done things differently. Imagine your finally going to buy the sneakers you've been wanting for a really long time. If one of your friends say they don't like them, then you start thinking about them in a different way, they changed your opinion right? Other peoples opinions will either affect your choices in a good way or a bad way. You have to keep in mind that your opinion is the one that matters the most.

If someone already went through what your going through then their opinion can make you decide things differently. If you have and older brother or sister they give you advice right? When they say stuff like ""trust me i know how it feels like"" it's because they don't want to see you go through the same thing as them. A lot of people have been in the same position as you once in their life, so why not go to them and ask them what they think. They can't go back and change what they did but they can advise you to do things differently. Their advice can help you make a good decision.

Having more than one persons opinion is very helpful. Everyone thinks differently and will help you make the right choice. Hearing multiple peoples opinions or thoughts can help you decide whether the choice your making is going to help you or not. Having multiple opinions from people can lead to making more thoughtful decisions. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
BEE54D4D2B79,"Taking one's own advice may be beneficial when common sense is involved, but seeking multiple opinions helps one make a better choice. People depend on other's gratification and it feels great when someone likes the outcome of a decision. In order for this to happen, one should ask multiple people for advice and shouldn't only take their's. When I take my own advice, it is often biased towards what I want, and I don't necessarily see all points of view of the decision I have to make. Taking my own advice is beneficial in situations where common sense is used and in situations where I have no one to to ask, such as logical situations or doing school work.

With more important decisions that go beyond common sense, seeking multiple opinions avoids bias, leads to multiple perspectives, and opens up new possibilities.

When someone seeks advice, they should ask multiple people because it ensures them that their choice will be least biased. People should avoid bias because some opinions may not benefit them and may only benefit the person who is giving the piece of advice. When people ask for advice, each person they ask most likely has a different opinion. When all these opinions are considered, the chance of bias is reduced. When someone takes their own advice, they may have a slight inclination to go for what they want to do, and they may not consider all options. For example, I have a decision to make of whether or not I want to move for my father's work to Generic_City. I only considered my own preferences for a while, and I automatically said that I didn't want to go. I refused to leave my friends, my school, my routine, and everything else that makes my life splendid here. When I finally decided to hear what my parents had to say, my choice became less biased. My parents helped me see the benefits of moving, which I had not thought about because I didn't want to think that I would enjoy moving. In addition they helped me see it in their point of view, which leads to the next point.

Talking to more than one person when faced with a difficult situation leads to multiple perspectives. With each person one asks for advice, there is ridiculously small chance that they would all have the same exact opinion. Each person is different and has a new perspective of the dilemma. Seeking advice from my parents would yield different perspectives than if I ask my friends or siblings. For instance, when I talked to my friends about the possibility of me moving to Generic_City, they were disappointed, as expected. They didn't want me to move, and they didn't want me to leave them. When my parents talked to me about moving to Generic_City, I was able to see it in their perspective. To them it would be a fabulous opportunity to study abroad, meet new people, learn a new culture, and visit a wonderful country. This new perspective opened me up to the idea of living in a completely different country.

Last but not least, seeking multiple opinions may open up new possibilities that should be considered when making a decision. Each person one talks to may offer a different alternative to the decision at hand. This leads to an array of new and sometimes worse options. When talking to my parents about moving to Generic_City, they told me that moving to Generic_City now would be the most beneficial because if we didn't move before high school, we would probably have to leave in the middle of the school year later on. In addition, some friends helped me see that moving to Generic_City would open an entirely new set of doors. My brother fantasized about the enjoyable vacations we could have and meeting new people at a new school. The more people one talks to, the more opinions they get, and the more opinions they get, the more options they hav to make the best choice.

Crucial aspects of making a good choice are avoiding bias, seeing the decision through other people's perspective, and considering all options. Seeking advice from multiple people leads to all of this, making asking people for advice an important task to do when faced with a choice to make. Avoiding bias aids in making a decision to which the outcome is beneficial to all concerned. New perspectives helps to consider how everyone feels about a choice. Finally, considering all options and outcomes makes for an easier time deciding which choice is better overall. Even when making petty choices that most people make each day, such as choosing what to eat and what to wear, people may benefit from a bit of advice. The world would be a wonderful place if everyone asks someone for advice before doing something that could change the course of events. Choices wouldn't be irrational, and petty fights wouldn't break out and start arguments or wars. All it takes to make a good decision and to be satisfied by the outcome is to talk to people and ask for their opinion. What is so difficult about this?",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
39179028B2DA,"By seeking many opinions from others, you're able to make better choices based on the people around you. They can give you more information on the topic and suggest revisions on the original choice, witch would improve overall quality.

The information you can get from someone is very important for someone who is making a choice, by hearing the opinions of others you gain knowledge on the topic that can improve your choice. The people that you talk to will also probably never have the same view on a topic, this in turn will give you more options. With more options you're able to choose witch opinion or view you want to follow, or even add more of them into the choice.

With all of the information that the views have given you, you can change your choice to better reflect on them. You'll want to revise or edit your choice based on the impact of the information that you've gathered, by doing so you improve what you're working on.

Improvement is important, especially for writers or decision makers. Because if they mess up they may end up telling false information or leaving out key details for their readers. By gathering other opinions you're given more information and revisioning ability, witch is helpful in improving the overall quality of the choice.

When you seek out the opinions of others, you can make better choices because of all the information that said opinions have given you. With this information you can revise and improve the quality of your work, if you are to make a choice you must think about how others will be effected by it, and how to improve the choice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
2FE4587D0800,"When searching for advice, do you ask more than one person? If not, here are reasons on why it is better to ask more than one person. Asking more than one person for advice can help you in numerous ways. When in need for advice, it is best to ask more than one person because it helps you be certain that one person is not just trying to make you feel better, it makes your options more clear to you, and helps your make up your mind faster.

Firstly, asking more than one person is best for you when you are doubtful of your decisions. Sometimes, there can be a case where a friend will not know what to say, and may just lie to make you feel better. Although, some people may not lie to you when you sat in gum or if your hair is messed up, it is always safe to ask multiple peers. When getting help with multiple people is best for multiple other reasons too.

Second, having multiple friends give you advice makes your options more clear. At some times, you may over think your problems and may need someone to break it down for you. In addition, with your thoughts being more cleared out, you may have more room to think and may be more comfortable to talk with others about everything. Altogether, When you have more than one person to help talk things down with you, your options will be more open to think and tell others.

Lastly, when asking multiple people, you can make up your mind faster. Having multiple people help you break down your problems lets you see them more clearly, letting you get through them faster. Also, when you have help to make up your mind, you have less weight on your shoulders. In general, when you have multiple people by your side for advice, it makes you feel better altogether.

In conclusion, when you need advice, it is best to ask more than one person because it help you make up your mind faster, makes your options for clear for you, and helps you make sure that one person is not just trying to make you feel better. It is not right when somebody fakes advice for someone just to make them feel better for example, ""Your dress looks really pretty!"" or ""You have nothing on the back of your pants, just keep walking."". This is why it is best to ask more than one person. If you ask only one person if you sat in gum or ask if your hair looks good, then it is probaly best for you to ask another peer.

When I ask for advice I like going to multiple people because I like hearing what others think. Getting multiple peoples opinions can be beneficial in so many ways. One way it can be beneficial is it can help you decide what you should do. For instance, if you had to decide where to go to college it can be hard deciding so it would be nice having multiple peoples opinions so that you feel like your not making the wrong decision. You would feel so happy knowing that you made the right choice especially since you got multiple peoples opinions on what they think you should do.

Another reason why getting other peoples opinions is helpful is because it can make you feel relived. Especially if you have no idea about what you should do. For me when I get other peoples opinions it does make me feel so much better knowing that I could now make the right decision and not feel bad about making the wrong decision. I also know that I have so many emotions when it comes to making decisions such as being stressed, overwhelmed, and just feeling sad or lost. So I think that it's important to see what other people think you should do.

In relation to that, I like hearing what others think because sometimes it's just nice hearing what others think. Whether it's good or bad it can be very helpful either way. Having feedback from others is a good thing in my opinion because it can help you improve if your working on a project and someone says you should add something or maybe they say you should take something away to make it better it can help you do better. Also improving things can make you feel so much better. You also can make others like your work more.

In addition, getting others opinion can be very helpful. For instance, like if your making something that you have never made before that you wanted to try and see how it turns out. Then you can ask people to try it and tell you what they think of it or what they think you should do to make it better. To where if you ever make it again you can improve it so that others like it more than they did before and you will feel good about what they think you should do and help you feel better about yourself.

Think about the more sophisticated choices you could have made if only you would have asked more people their opinions on the decision or choice you were about to make. There have been countless times where I have asked myself, did I just make the best choice I could have made? Whether it's a decision you make in sports about what could be the right move to make on this next play, or a choice you have to make at home or in school, it is always good to have plenty of opinions that can help you make the best choice.

Your teammates in sports can help you make the best choice. I don't know how many times I can count where I have been playing baseball and we had a team huddle. These usually happen so you can go over your next big play. Since there is a team that have your backs no matter what, I am for sure that I am one-hundred percent comfortable making this next play. Some could also relate this to making an important life choice. Do I take this fantastic job offer? Should we move out of the state we already live in? Do I take enough time in the day to do my homework? There are countless questions as to why you should ask people around you if you are making the best choice. But asking people around you, who have probably been right where you are before, could lead to the best outcome for you.

Bad choices lead to consequences. Over fifty-four percent of people in the United States believe that the bad choices they have made can lead to consequences later on. I wonder how many of those same people have asked any of their friends and family if the choice they make right now would turn on them, or benefit them later on. Whenever I have a big decision to make I go to my friends, family, coaches, and teachers. No questions asked. It is so good to have multiple peoples opinions on these types of things. There was a time when I had to choose whether to go on a better baseball team that had some of my friends on it, or a not as good baseball team that had none of my friends on it. Changing teams can be a big deal, some could relate it to working for a better company than they were before, but these decisions don't come easily do they? No, they take time and who better to help you with these decisions than the people whom you trust the most. After about a week of receiving opinions from people such as my family and friends, I made this best choice for me, and it turned out great. I started having more fun hanging with my friends and we were winning more games. My old coach understood and I still keep in touch with him to this day. I know that without my peers, I probably wouldn't have made the same choice, and my other choice could have led to smaller consequences such as, not getting enough recognition or losing more games than we should be losing.

Surround yourself with positive friends to help make the best decisions. You may be a police officer and have to make an on the job decision, well no worries there because you have some of the best guys in the world to help you make that decision. But what if you didn't have positive friends in your life and you weren't surrounded people that could help you make the right decision. Would you go down the wrong path? There are many things that can lead to wrong decisions,and there are many things that can lead to good ones. It depends on you and your friends and family.

With all this being said, it is in your best interest to make sure you ask more than one person about how you could make a better choice. You may be into sports and you have your teammates to ask, or you may have a job and you have you co-workers to ask, however these people all have one thing in common, and that is that they will all lead you down the right path and help you make the best decision. Which is why multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Having multiple opinions from different people is better than having only one because a person will get better different points of view, know why a person's opinion was what it was, and understand the pros and cons.

One reason why asking for different opinions is better because one will get a multitude of of points of view. Having a variety of views is good because somebody can base his or her choice from a collection. For example, some friends get into a fight, but one person is bystander. One of the friends ask the bystander to take his or her side of the fight, but the bystander doesn't know the other friend's side. The bystander is basically supporting one side of the story without knowing the other friend's story. If the bystander knew the other friend's story, his or her decision may have been altered.

Another reason why having a variety of opinions is important because someone will know the reason why a person's opinion was positive, negative, or neutral. Knowing why a person's opinion was what it was is important because the information could be be useful to someone. For instance, a new artist needs suggestions on where to buy the best art supplies. The artist's art teacher recommended him to go to Brand XY's art store, because it has nice staff, while his friend recommended him to go to Brand XYZ's art store because it has a wide assortment to choose from. Based on these opinions, the artist decides to go to Brand XYZ's art store because he needs the best art supplies and has an assortment to choose from.

Finally, the last reason why having an array of opinions is crucial because a person will be able to detect the pros and cons of a specific subject. Detecting pros and cons are fundamental because a consumer will know what to expect. Examples of this are reviews for certain items and locations. Consumers write reviews, so they can let other people know if they should or should not go to certain places or buy a certain item. When a person reads these reviews, they get a sense of what's good and what's bad.

When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. People get different opinions so that they can get a good understanding of the the topic and have different perspectives. Somebody also might want different opinions, so they can see if something specific they want is in their topic. Another person maybe a consumer, looking for the best items or place to go, and basing where or what they want on reviews. These are all the reasons why asking multiple people for their opinions is better than asking a single person: A person will have different perspectives, know why a person's opinion was what it was, and understand the pros and cons.  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

People seek advice from multiple people because it helps them make better decisions, or maybe they are not experienced with something and asks for advice from someone who is experienced.

Getting advice from many people can help a person make better decisions. Because some people knows what's best for a person, and they can help them. By advising them to achieve what is best for them. This way the person has made a good choice benefiting them because of the advice that they got from people.

The second reason is that if the person is not experienced with something they can ask advice from people who are experienced. Since other people are experienced they can give the person advice on what they can do. The advice can help the person a lot, and can get the person on the right track. For example, you have to babysit your nephew, and you have no experience with children. Out of nowhere your nephew starts crying and you don't know what to do, so you call your aunt. Since the aunt has experience with children she tells you to put on his favorite cartoon on the television, and your nephew stops crying.

This is what it may look like when struggling to make a decision in a tough situation, trying to identify the best choice. Whenever people have a difficult decision on their hands, it is only an instinct to ask advice from those around. It is better to ask advice from more than one person when making a decision. Receiving wisdom from multiple individuals can help someone conclude to a well thought out decision, rather than getting advice from only one person. Seeking opinions from multiple people can help someone make a better choice in many ways, including opening up to different perspectives and being introduced to more options.

Many believe exploring multiple perspectives can allow someone to make a better decision. Getting advice from multiple people rather than one can help a person recognize thoughts that weren't yet put into consideration. Perspectives may differ within many people, no matter their age and amount of knowledge. The opinions and perspectives of different individuals can impact those who are making a decision by changing their point of view and advising them to make a choice that is true to what the believe in. Hearing the opinions of different people may help someone figure out their perspective towards the decision they are making, therefore making it easier to make a better choice. Even if the person trying to make a difficult choice doesn't agree with the perspectives of others, putting them into thoughtful consideration can help them view the situation in many diverse ways. Additionally different perspectives may help a person recognize and identify what they believe in. If a person were to be asked to make a decision about their community, it is only obvious to ask advice from those within their community. Getting the perspective from individuals from the same community can help the person make a more proactive choice because some may be more educated than others regarding their community.

Receiving more opinions can introduce more options, resulting in a better choice. More options can help a person better think through a difficult decision by giving them more opportunities to conclude to one final choice. Consequently, increasing the number of options when struggling to make a choice can result in the ability to tell the difference between good and bad choices. Having more options allows a person to easily eliminate the choices that are uneducated and ineffective compared to the others. Although some options may seem worse than others, putting those options into deep consideration can allow a person to better understand what they are trying to accomplish with the choice in which they are trying to make. However, having multiple options may make the decision someone is trying to make seem easier to determine. More options are only beneficial when trying to identify the best choice.

People may struggle when trying to make the best choice unless they are open to different perspectives and receiving more options. In what ways may getting advice from multiple people help impact someone to make a better choice? Hearing and opening up to the different perspectives of others can help someone recognize choices that weren't yet explored of identified. These perspectives can further the understanding of the decision in which someone is struggling to make, and elaborate on any potential choices that could be in consideration. Seeking advice and opinions from multiple people introduces more options. An increasing number of options when making a difficult decision may help someone make a better choice by giving them more choices to choose from.

Seeking more than one opinion can help someone make better choice because they could choose the best opinion, not have a limited way of thinking, and help make progress.

Seeking multiple opinion can help someone make a better choice because they could choose the best opinion. When people do a group project, they get everyone's opinion. This helps to choose the best opinion that fits in the topic. When I had to make a small car for a school project, I asked my parents and friends to get multiple opinions. It helped me find the best material to make the car out of and designs of the car. Multiple opinions could help people to find the best opinion that fits in the topic.

Getting multiple opinions can help not having a limited way of thinking. If every people got advice from one person, they would all have same aspects. Even if the person was wrong, they would all think they got the right opinion because they only listened to one person and never had a chance to get a opinion from people who has other aspects on the problem. When I ask people for opinion about a certain problem, it helps me have thoughts on every aspect. I could know people's reason why they agree to the solution about the problem and people's reason why they disagree the solution. Then it helps me choose the more reasonable side of the solution.

Getting multiple opinion also helps make progress. For example, if a company is making a new phone for the elders, they could ask the elders to use their new product and hear what is a good option or a good option to add and what is a option that they don't need. When I made a small car, I asked my parents to see it and tell me things that I have to fix or add more. After hearing all the opinions I made changes to make the car look better.

Seeking more than one opinion can help someone make better choice because they could choose the best opinion, not have a limited way of thinking, and help make progress. They could choose the best opinion by listening to every options. They would not have a limited way of thinking because they can listen to every aspects.

07D52443B420,"Do you like to be given multiple good opinions instead of just one? Being given multiple opinions or viewpoints on a situation can be much more helpful than just one. The three reasons multiple opinions are better than just one is: You have more overall brain power and knowledge, a variety of opinions to use to benefit yourself, and the advice you are given may be incorrect, not helpful, or you may not like it; Therefore, having another opinion to lean on can be very useful when a scenario like this occurs.

The first reason I declared why multiple opinions are better is you gain more knowledge about how your peers or even the public views things. For example, just recently baseball season started up again, and I needed a new baseball bat. So, I began browsing online, reading reviews for each bat and seeing what comments or opinions people had about them. I asked my father and some of my teammates for their opinions on which bat to purchase. I asked not just whether the bat was good or bad, but what were some features they liked and some features they disliked about it. Every time I heard someones opinion, I acquired some of the information they told me. Using that I was able to make a smart and thought out decision on which baseball bat I should purchase.

Next, my second reason is talking to more people for their opinion on something means you will have either a mixed variety of opinions or a large number of people with the same opinion on something. Currently, across the world we are experiencing a global health crisis with the rapid spreading of the Coronavirus. Say for instance, you are head of the school board and you have to make a decision for your whole county as to whether or not our schools should be closed or not. The safety of our students, staff, and teachers relies on your decision. If you go around and collect everyone's opinions, you can combine them to come up with the best idea possible. Hearing as many people's opinions as you can and combining them is very beneficial when making decisions.

Lastly, my third and final reason to prove that having multiple people voice their opinions is better than just one is that you may not always find a persons advice helpful. If you ask one person for an opinion on something and you don't find it useful, you have nothing else to help you. On the other hand, if you have collected multiple opinions from multiple people, instead of just one, it doesn't matter if you don't like someones advice. You will still have more pieces of advice or opinions from different people to use for your benefit. That is why when asking for opinions, it is crucial to hear and collect one from multiple people, not just one person.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is very beneficial. Only hearing one opinion is alright, but hearing more than one is only that much better. My three reasons I have this claim are, a persons advice simply might not be helpful to you and having a variety of opinions that you can refer to and use for help is important. My last reason, with hearing more people's opinions you can acquire more knowledge, and in the end, knowledge is key.                ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
9A45943A21D5,"BENEFITS OF SEEKING MULTIPLE OPINIONS

It is shown in recent studies that not seeking multiple opinions can lead to stress, depression, and most times suicide, which occurs mostly in teenagers, but seeking multiple opinions is more beneficial because it gives us more options to choose from, shows us others point of view to the problem at hand, and it makes us feel better about ourselves.

Seeking others point of view could be overwhelming, but beneficial because listening to what others have to say about the problem could open your eyes and mind to the answer you were looking for, therefore leading you to making a wiser and better decision, overcoming the obstacle that was placed in your way.

Having only one answer could be difficult in solving a problem because the answer you have could be wrong and might not be the answer you were looking for, but having multiple answers would be more beneficial because you could cross out the answers you think are wrong and will still have more answers to choose from. You do not have to do it all by yourself because you have people around you who would give you good advises and help you find the solution to the problem you are facing.

The opinions given to you by others might help solve your problem and might not, but it makes you feel better knowing that you have talked to someone about that problem, which would have released the stress and burden you carry and would bring comfort to yourself and bring peace to your mind and heart, which causes you to have a better mindset and make a better decision.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
D6E6CFF686BF,"Opinions are great when it comes to seeking advise. The top things why people ask people for advise is because they want to dial the main one almost everyone said so that it is best option, people may have good different opinions, and the people might have gone threw it.

Dialing down the one opinion isn't always the worst thing, it could just mean you like that one opinion, or it could mean that it was the one that almost everyone said. Sometimes opinions aren't always bad thing, but you have to have a reason for the opinion or advise that you are giving to someone. Although some of the advise people gave you wasn't what you were looking for but it could help you if that is your last option.

Second reason why you ask people for advise is because they all have different opinions about the situation that you are in. Different ideas help because you might have not thought of that idea or thought of the idea but never saw it in that way. Yes maybe some if not most ideas will be bad, but it is still good to try so you do get there perspective on the situation.

Third reason why you ask for advise is because the people that you're asking might have been threw that situation before in there lifetime. I'll give you an example, when you ask for advise you usually go with someone that is older than you like a family member or an adult if you are a kid. Usually elders give good advise too because they have seen or done the thing that you are asking them.

Finally, as you can see there are many different ways why you ask for advise like dialing it down to the better one, different opinions from other people, and they might have gone threw the exact same situation or seen it happen. This is why opinions are great to people who need advise from other people in this world. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
C541FA8BBFDB,"As Generic_Name gently strokes her scrawny cat, she ponders back to the day she lost herself. It was 8th grade year, this was the year your life started. Before you could even figure out yourself, just your grades alone could determine if you got into college or not. Although she already had alright grades, she still spend countless hours studying instead of taking care of her acne or just getting in the shower. Soon she began to realize that her life was becoming numb, she stopped answering texts, talking, and she even began to loose her friends. Before she knew it, she was spending every weekend alone in her room just studying for absolutely no reason. Not long after, her parents became worried and sent her to a therapist, but most of the time she just came up with an excuse not to go. Generic_Name mainly made excuses because she thought nobody could give her advice that would relate to her life. This just shows that if you ask multiple people for advice you are bound to find someone that can relate to you. Seeking advice from more that one person you trust can be beneficial because you can hear different perspectives and make your own choice, you can also learn from their mistakes, and you can become a better person by listening to what other people have to say.

First off, making your own opinion, after hearing other advice, is important because it allows you to feel like you are making your own decisions in life. Similarly, when Generic_Name was a teen, her mother told her,"" Even though people will always try to tear you down, never take their words to heart. Now Generic_Name is a motivational speaker and shares her stories to everyone. This just shows that one little sentence can truly change someones life. For instance, Generic_Name goes to school everyday knowing she will get bullied, but she just remember the words her grandpa said,"" Although they are the ones being mean to you, remember that they are probably going through a lot more things than you are."" Just this small piece of advice that Generic_Name hangs onto makes her feel like she is changing lives everyday.

Secondly, learning from the mistakes that other people made can help you so you won't make the same mistake. For example, Generic_Name learned from his uncle,"" If you want to own and thrive in the pizza business you have to make profit,"" and now Generic_Name is the owner of the biggest pizza place in New York! Saying this, normally you can't become famous or rich without a little help and and advice from other people. Additionally, Lady Gaga says that the only thing that got her through middle school and high school was the last words her mom said,"" I promise the times you feel like nothing is going right in you life, those days will make you a better person."" Lady Gaga needed that quote a lot of her life and she knew that her mom didn't have that when she needed it. Although life isn't easy, the things that help you will probaly hepl other people too, even if they seem little.

Finally, just listening to other people say and taking it to heart will make you a better person one day. For instance, Generic_Name who was very shy as a kid was always told by his mom,"" Express yourself in whatever way you can,"" once Generic_Name took that to heart he began writing poems and songs. Generic_Name is now 21 and professionally writes songs for popular artists. If Generic_Name had stayed how he was, he would probably be working in a normal office and living in a small apartment with very noisy neighbors. Another example is Generic_Name, she is a professional model, but when she was younger she had no coordination and it seemed like she had two left feet. Until one day, her mom suggested that she should take ballet to help with her coordination. Even after just a couple lessons, she was already doing better. Just the small act of kindness that her mom showed to her made her and her life so much better.

As Generic_Name trudges through the door, she ignores everybody in her path and heads straight to her room. Generic_Name hadn't realized how difficult it is to move schools, until is actually happened to her. Everything was different and she didn't know anybody, neither had she met anybody yet. With a soft tap on the door, her sister Generic_Name enters the room and says,"" Hey sis I'm guessing the first day was rough?"" With a sad nod, Generic_Name turns and questioned,"" How do you do it? Everybody is so different from my old school and nobody wants to talk to me."" Generic_Name sits right next to her and pulls her into a hug. Not long after, she says,"" Just be open to new people and don't worry about what is to come, live in the moment."" After a good night's sleep and the advice Generic_Name told her, she starts her day off by introducing herself to everyone she meets. Before the day is over, she already has a table to sit and and a large group of friends. When Generic_Name comes through the door, she sprints to Generic_Name and gives her a huge hug and exclaims,"" It worked! I introduced myself to everyone I saw and now I have a table to sit at, and lots of friends!"" Generic_Name stands up and squeals with joy. Without Generic_Name's advice Generic_Name would have never found the friends she has now.

He texted, ""Hey, I was wondering if I should buy something about 40 dollars. I need to pay rent but I might need to budget my money. What should I do?"" Generic_Name replies that he should buy it and budget his money. Generic_Name decides to purchase the shirt, but he feels like he shouldn't. He decides to ask his mom. His mom said that he should pay the rent instead of a shirt because if he would get an unexpected increase on his bill, he wouldn't be able to pay it.

He asked his friend who said to budget his money afterwards. What Generic_Name did was ask one person and Generic_Name's opinion was bias against what his bills may be. When Generic_Name asked his mother, she said that he shouldn't and be prepared for the bill in case there was an increase. Generic_Name' mom was bias against the shirt.

When you choose to ask someone for help, somebody could give you more than one option. Maybe the question you thought was a yes or no answer, could be both answers.

Or, someone could say to not buy any clothes and stick with the bills to pay. Hearing more options and opinions could help you make an option that you think would be best for you.

Which i did and when i was turning it in i got a really bad grade and i asked my science teacher why and he said ÃÂ¨the website is fake it tells false claims about your projectÃÂ¨. So when i got home i told my mom what had happend and she said ÃÂ¨i know all about this why didnt you ask me for adviceÃÂ¨ and i told her i asked my brother and she said ÃÂ¨this is why its so important to ask more than one person on adviceÃÂ¨. So i have stuck to that for the rest of my life.

In a way that story was kinda related to my next claim about always ask a trusted adult first cause if i had asked my mom in the first place none of this would of happend. Another reason everyone should always ask a trusted adult first is it could be personal. So if someone tells there friends they might not alway seem like there real friends after they tell other people about stuff they didnt want them knowing. A tusted adult whould never do that and if some people dont have a trusted adult tou can always talk to a school counseler or family in some way shape or form. This is why it is so important to ask a trusted adult first.

In a kind of funny way my first topic is also in a way related to this one. Because sure my brother gave advice but if I had asked my mom i would have listened to her. this is why it is also important to ask more than one person for advice. Another example would be say someone asks for advise from a friend on weather they should partisipate in pajama day for our school. So they say no i think its dumb. So then you ask another friend for advice and say yeah and that they should do it together cause it will be fun. So you do it and you had a good day at school.

To conclude this these are some reason why asking more than one person for advise is so important. Also te 3 main reasons how to make better desition on what to do for asking for advise. the best three are, because some people may not agree with the first persons they asked advice they gave. The first person people should ask should be a trusted adult because you know they can trust them, and finally everyone should always ask more than one person because they might get a better outcome from someone elses advice. So these are the reasons why its important to know how to make the right choices when asking for advise.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
6AB7A38DBD70,"People sometimes ask more than one person for advice on hard decisions. How can asking multiple people for advice help someone make the right choice? I think getting advice from more than one person is helpful because they'll have different peoples opinions.

Receiving more advice is very useful, because one person could of been in the same situation your in and the other person could just know the right thing to do. The person that has been in the situation before could have did the wrong, and messed up something then you seek ideas that they give you to do the right. On the other hand the person such as your parent gives you advice knows more than the person you asked before because they been on the earth longer and seen bad things happen. Advice from multiple people is useful to put all their ideas, and or opinions together to make your own good decision.

Seeking advice from all different basketball coaches, and trainers is very good because they'll have lots of their own opinions. Generic_Name from Generic_School could tell you, ""Need to work on moving without the ball"", but your high school coach tells you that ""You need to work on, on the ball defense"". One trainer could say ""You got to work on your jump shot off the dribble a little more, but another trainer says ""Your jump shot is fine, but you have to improve your handles."" Trainers can give you ideas on what college you choose to go to when the decision comes down to that.

People ask for more than one person for advice why do people do that? I think that's a good idea to do because you learn from people. Won't make the same mistakes that they have did. People can tell different stuff you need to work on if it's sports, school, or being yourself. All advice is good.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
68486609C73E,"I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help one make a better decision or to handle the situation better. Have you ever had a difficult time deciding on which decision to make? Couldn't decide what gift to buy? How to settle a problem? Usually when a person searches for a gift they ask them self if the receiver would like it or not, or maybe they ask their friends if they would think the recipient would enjoy it. When a person goes shopping, most people ask which item would be the better deal if they were to buy or if it will of any use to the user. By asking for multiple opinions an individual will be able to receive additional information, different opinions, and obtaining different answers.

An option they can receive after gaining a second opinion, is being able to compare the options that have been received. By being able to analyze second option(s), he or she can compare it to their own and check off the different pros and cons. When sorting out the differences that each option had been criticized, one can check which option would suit the issue better. By doing so, they'd be able to use or add to the original choice, and create a better result for the problem. This method can help most handle the situation for a more positive result and can benefit the person(s) who tries this.

Secondly, the person can receive different information on the topic. By receiving new additional advice or information, they can save it when they need it later on for future situations, or if they are giving advice to someone else. When receiving more information on the situation at hand, you can come to have a better understanding or to be privy to something that you did not know. Usually after learning something new your opinion or thoughts might change. So if you are able to obtain new information from multiple opinions, then your thought on the matter might change based on what you believe or now understand.

Going with the idea of receiving new information, an individual can come to have a better understanding of the situation and obtaining new answers. Like the saying ""You cannot preach what you do not understand,"" you cannot handle a problem that you don't fully understand. By having a stronger understanding of the situation, they'll able to confidently explain why it was chosen as the response. By receiving new answers to the problem, among them a person will eventually find an agreeable answer or When receiving new answers, the variety of answers may vary delivering many new options to mind.

In conclusion,

I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help one make a better decision or to handle the situation better. The multiple opinions received can help you obtain different answers, information, and being able to compare the options given. Receiving multiple views and opinions can make the response stronger, confident, and lead to a beneficial outcome.

It might affect your future in life. You dont want to messed it up cause you might regent it later in life. You wanted know something before it happens or you will be scared. You want to know what is going happen next cause you're wondering. this one of my reasons why a person seeking multiple opinions can help someone form a better choices.

If your in need of an advice you would most likely like to hear one from a couple people. Why? because you would like to be able to get as much help possible. You could lean more to one opinion or the other or maybe even all of them.

If you ask a friend to revise a project you have worked on you would like to get an opinion on how to fix many things, you wouldnt just like one and have the rest incorrect or leaving it unrevised. You have more to rely on when you have more than one opinion.

Why are multiple opinions better than one? because you have more to rely on with more than one opinion

2575D2691B29,"Do you think that seeking more opinions can help you to make a better choice? If you get multiple opinions, you will have the capability to make better choices throughout your life. I believe that seeking more opinions is a better option because you can find many different points of view, you can get more options, and some people are more knowledgeable than others.

The first reason why seeking multiple opinions is better, is that you can get multiple different points of view. An example of this would be baking a cake. Many people have baked their cakes differently. My grandmother will make a sketch of the cake before she makes it, while my mother will be thinking of the design of the cake while she is making it. Another example of this would be gardening. When I garden, I will pull the weeds out first and then water the plants. But my grandfather will water the plants before he pulls out the weeds. Getting different points of view can help make a decision between something. These two examples show that it is better to get multiple different points of view.

My second reason why seeking multiple opinions is better, is that you get more options for your choice. An example of this would be making dinner for your family. Some of your family might want spaghetti, while the rest of your family wants fried chicken. When you have more options, you have a wider variety that you can choose from. Another example of this would be going out to eat with your friends. When you go out to eat, people never seem to agree with eachother. Some of your friends might want Taco Bell while your other friends might want Texas Roadhouse. You can get many different options for many things with the opinions of different people. These two examples show that having more options will make things turn out better.

My final reason why seeking multiple opinions is better, is that some people are more knowledgeable than others. An example of this would be buying a car. When you buy a car, you want to get the best car that's available within your budget. If you talk to a car salesman he/she will know more about what kind of car that you are able to get, versus asking your 12-year old brother which car you should buy. Another example of this would be to buy a house. If your have a budget for a house, you would like to find the best house that you can afford. A real estate agent can help you find and pick a house that is affordable, opposed to talking to a fisherman about what houses are availiable in the area. These two examples show that you can make better choices when you talk to with people who are more knowledgeable in that area.

I believe that seeking more opinions is better because you can find many different points of view, you can get more options, and some people are more knowledgeable than others. There are many ways to make choices, but the best way is to find multiple opinions. These three reasons and their examples all show that it is better to get multiple opinions before you make a choice about something.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
29CA453A339D,"Have you ever had an experience where you don't know what choices in life to make? Whether they're risky or not. You may go on the internet and/or ask people for better advice for your choices. When you hear these different answers from them, you can get mixed opinions. But, one of those answers can be better for you, and help to improve your life in many ways. Seeking different opinions from people for advice can help you make a better choice, know the struggles of it, and make you a better person

You can make a better choice if you get different opinions from people. Have you have ever gone to a store, or seen a commercial that said ""This product is great!"". You'd want to buy it right away, but then you may question it at first. After basically consulting yourself, you may end up with no decision in mind. This is where seeking opinions from other people is better. You could go on to the internet, and see the reviews from it, or you can ask your friend who has that product and ask for his opinion on it. If the product is great, then you'll probably buy it and vice versa. Consulting people before making a choice is better, because then you'll probably won't have to deal with the issues after making the choice without consulting people.

Sometimes, you can know some of the struggles of the choice if you want to choose it after consulting people. Everyday things have a consequence. Whether it's from buying a product to even flying a plane. Some of the choices you want to make, may have issues or consequences. For example, vaping. A lot of teens in America and other countries are vaping through a vape pen or e-cigarette. Some of the teens do it because they think it will make them look cool, popular, or even join the ""popular"" group. Some of the teens or ads may convince you to do it because ""it isn't harmful, or it will make you cooler"". But, if you consult people, and hear their opinions, you can know the true consequences (struggles) you can face from it if you do it. Knowing the struggles can make you choose a better choice, for your life and career.

Lastly, if we combine our two points stated earlier, you can know what choice is better, and know the struggles of it, to make you a better person. If we use the previous example of vaping, some teenagers do it to become popular, and companies persuade them by saying ""it isn't harmful"". Sometimes, you may be faced in that scenario of wanting to vape to prove to your friends that you are cool. But, if you know the struggles, because of commercials or the internet, you can decline it, and make a better choice. You can become a better person, and not harm yourself and others around you. Even you can consult other people who want advice, and possibly give them a better opinion.

Seeking different opinions from people for advice can help you make a better choice, know the struggles of it, and make you a better person. The choices you make can affect you and people around you. The choices you make can be better, by knowing the struggles of it, which can make you a better person.

34FF5653BC2A,"With just one word your whole view of something could change in an instant. I believe if you listen to multiple opinions you will make better choices. It could be changed from making a tough decision by listening to others or by being open to different view by listening to more than one opinion.

One way asking for multiple opinions can help is when your making thought decisions. One way is multiple opinions can help tell someone the pros and cons. When you are deciding on getting something expensive someone would want to have a second opinion on that so they would go and look at review to get a better idea of if it is worth it or not. When someones deciding on doing something but cant get that one thing that will convince them enough another opinion can tip them over to see whether or not they should or should not. One opinion can dramatically change someone position. If someone feels like their opinion supports one side but then hears about somebody else opinion it could change there opinion in an instant. With that opening up to a different opinion in a hard situation can help a lot.

With having multiple opinions when someones deciding on something they can show different viewpoints on that situation which could help a lot when deciding on something. One way that could work is if someone sees a different view you can see different experience someone had with it like if someone wanted to buy something and looked at all the reviews of that item they could have a better understanding about what there getting. Most people opinions are very valid opinions that cold persuade someone but sometimes another persons opinion could persuade them even more than the other one for example if someone is trying to get advice from someone but there advice really did not convince them well enough but then went to another Pearson who did persuade there opinion. If someone only gets one opinion then they will not really know about it enough to make a good decision. Say that someone wanted to become a lawyer but the only view they got from it was that it pays a lot but if they had gotten another view point they could have learned about the struggle of getting to that place. If people can open up to other opinions they can have a easier time to make there decisions.

Finally the last way that it would be bad to not get a second opinion is not knowing the other side that could affect someone in a bad way. One way that it would be bad is that someone might not know about the other view. If someone only listen to one opinion they will never realize about the other opinions people have that could make them have a valid decision. A viewpoint can persuade someone without them realizing the other side. If someone opinion is a strong opinion that could be the only thing that they need to be persuaded without realizing about the full thing. My last point is that only seeing one view can affect on how someone look at that one thing. If someone looks at a doctor and think that they want to be one so they can make a lot of money but never had someone else voice there opinion and tell them that its a very hard thing to accomplish than they will never realize it until it is too late for them. to close that out people should always be open to multiple opinions.

In Conclusion having multiple opinions on something could make them have a better choice on what to pick from having an opinion on making tough decisions, multiple opinions show different viewpoint, and only knowing one side can affect a decision in a bad way. If more people just instead of being self centered start to be open minded and have other peoples opinion flow threw there heads then there lives would change for the better.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
342AED7864B0,"Why is it people usually end up asking more than one person for advice on one thing?

I find it useful because it gives me the ability to make a better choice.

I believe having more than one opinion will help people make the correct decision/better choices.

I will discuss how multiple opinions could change peoples answers to better ones, how multiple opinions can keep people out of trouble, and a story on how multiple opinions from my friends got me out of trouble in school.

Multiple opinions can change peoples viewpoints, solutions, or advice they received.

People can end up realizing they had a answer wrong with multiple opinions.

This is possible because all the opinions from others could all be pointing out a certain thing that was incorrect.

People can also change their answer to a much better one with the help of multiple opinions.

All the people giving feedback can also be feedback on how to specify your answer or how to improve it a little.

Another thing that multiple opinions can help on is advice.

The first or/and second person that you talk to for advice could give you a bad piece of advice.

By talking to more than just one or two people, you can end up realizing that one of the first people you were talking to gave you a bad piece of advice.

Overall, multiple people can just help you with advice or better/correct answers.

With more than one opinion as well though, people can avoid bad things, not just bad advice.

For example, people can inform others not to go into a certain place/area.

It could be a harmful place and anyone that goes there could be possibly injured.

Multiple peoples advice can also stop someone from doing a dangerous activity.

For example, if multiple people talk to someone to try and stop them from doing something bad, they could persuade a friend to not drunk drive.

Multiple opinions can tell someone they shouldn't do something so they can just avoid anything bad overall.

People could give advice not to cheat on tests and etc.

Multiple opinions can persuade people to avoid getting in trouble is what I am trying to say with this paragraph.

Now, after talking about people giving advice not the cheat on tests, I'd like to tell you a story about a event in school I almost got into trouble for.

The only reason I didn't get in trouble is because my friends with their opinions convinced me not to do a bad thing.

When I was in 4th grade, I usually got into trouble on a almost weekly basis.

It usually was just small things like speaking out of turn and I almost never actually got into big trouble.

I almost got into big trouble one day though when I decided to try and cheat on a test.

The reason why I wanted to cheat was because I completely forgot to study for the test and I felt like I wasn't prepared.

I asked a friend if they could help give me advice on this and they said not to cheat.

I didn't feel persuaded to not cheat because it was only one person and others could say to cheat.

When I asked all my other friends they agreed with the first person.

Seeing that everyone agreed with the first person persuaded me not to cheat on the test.

When test day came up (the next day), I took the test without cheating and hoping a little bit of my studying from the previous night would help.

I ended up having a pretty good grade while someone else in my class was caught cheating on the test.

I am grateful for my friends who told me not to cheat and I promised myself that day I wouldn't cheat again.

That was my reasoning for believing that having multiple opinions is better than only having one opinion.

Multiple opinions can let others have a better solution or better piece of advice.

It can also keep people out of trouble like it did for me in the story I just told you about.

What I would like you, the reader to do is to make sure you get advice from a group of people and not just one person when you are seeking for advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
6C6F9213C5C4,"Sometimes I find myself stuck and confused over some of the smallest things. Typically I am debating over which decision would lead to the best outcome. I strongly believe that having many peoples opinions to consider is always helpful. Asking more experienced people, having good and bad things to think about , and getting many different opinions are all ways to make decision making easier.

When it comes to asking people for advice, most of the time the more advice I get, the better. Having multiple opinions to think about is better than just one. There are many pros and cons for everything and asking many people for advice will help to point those pros and cons out. When I have everyone's advice to think about, it allows me to think about all of the good and bad things that could happen based on the choice I make.

In addition to that, talking to many people for advice on something helps me see from their point of view. Sometimes I don't realize how big or small the situation I'm in actually is. When I take a moment to look at the situation from a different prospective, it helps me to be more open minded. Sometimes we all get so distracted and don't realize how much our decisions could affect others. Taking a moment to see something from someone else's point of view wouldn't be such a bad idea.

Not only should we ask others for advice, but asking others who happen to be experienced is never a bad idea. Some people specialize in certain topics and asking someone who knows a lot about something could be very beneficial. Many times I have asked my older brother for help with things like my phone or the television, because when it comes to technology he has always been very helpful. Often times adults are the best people to ask for advice from because they are very experienced at life.

In conclusion, I believe that asking for advice from many people will always help. Also asking more than one person and seeking many different opinions to help make the best choice is always a good idea. It's never a bad idea to rethink choices based on other peoples advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EDDFFD34DBD4,"Is it better fro you to ask for more advice or less? In my opinion I believe that the more advice your gaining from different sources is crucial and here are a few reasons why i believe that.

The first reason is that the more sources you talk to it's more likely your going to get more advice then just talking to one source. On top of that if you talk to more sources they will most likely have different opinions from one another. Along with the other reasons the more different opinions those sources have the more advice youre taking in so you can make a smarter decision for yourself.

the second reason i believe it is better to talk to multiple source's is the decision the more advice you gain from the sources makes the decision a lot easier for you to make it would also help you make the correct decision. From experience it's a lot better to get more advice than a little amount. I needed some advice about a game to buy so i went to one of my closest friends he told me to get a game that he had and it would be super fun if we both played it together. but i was pretty hesitant of just buying the game because i didn't think i would play it very much because it didn't seem that interesting to me so what i did was went to a couple more of my other friends and they all suggested a different game than what my best friend suggested but they all suggested the same game everyone else did though and since they all had the game i went with the game they suggested and now i play it almost everyday with them.

The third reason i believe it is smart to talk to multiple source's for taking in advice instead of just talking to one source is opinions. The source's could have different opinions if you talk a lot different sources you might hear something you didn't even think about and that could change the solution to your problem for the better or for the worse. Like with the video game situation listened to my other friend's game suggestions i would had wasted my money on something i wasn't going to play i did listen to my other friends opinions i bought something i want to play. so you see that even strange suggestions can help make a decision on if you want to buy or sell or maybe even keep something. but like i said different suggestions can have a great impact on what your decision may be because without my best friend's suggestion i wouldn't have gone an talked to my other friend's about what i should buy.

Those are three reasons why i would talk to multiple different source's and get there advice instead of just talking to only one source and getting a microscopic amount of advice compared to the amount of advice i would get talking to multiple source's.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

I believe seeking help from multiple people can help you make better decisions. A couple reasons why I think that is, It helps you succeed in life, It helps when making a decision, and an example is that I made a great decision In my life.

First, seeking multiple opinions helps people succeed in life. One way is when going to college. College is very important to people's life and people giving opinions to them is encouraging them that is will be fun. Another way is when a person is mad at somebody. People encouraging them to stop can help them stop being mad. The last reason is when somebody is taking a test they can get help. When they are stuck then can ask a question to the teacher and can get a opinion on the question and then that can help them get the question right. Get multiple opinions it will help you succeed in life.

Second, getting multiple opinions helps when making a decision. It helps when picking out what shirt or shorts or any type of clothing they want. When they dont know what type of clothing they want to buy multiple opinions can help a lot when not knowing what to get. It also helps when picking which shoe they want and which one is the best for them. Opinions from parents and the workers that are helping the person will help them see if the shoes fits and if it is the right type for them. It also helps when the person doesnt know which place they want to go to. Getting opinions and ideas from friends will help when picking which place you want to go. Multiple opinions helps a person when making a decision.

The last one is that I made a good decision. One day I was playing basketball and this guy got mad because i blocked his shot. After I blocked his shot he wanted to fight me. So he came after me, he laid a punch on my chest. It hurt pretty bad. I wanted to fight him and punch him back so badly because I wanted to stick up for myself. Then, my friends who we were playing with said,""Don't punch back it is not the right thing to do,"" so i didint punch back and I walked away and went home. I was OK, but I had a big bruise on my chest. That is an example of how multiple opinions from others can help you make better decisions. If I would have not walked away, we would have got into a big fight. So, I am glad that I walked away. My parents were very happy as well. Always make the right decision and the good choice not the bad choice.

I believe seeking a lot of opinions will help you make better decisions in life.

One person can say something completely different from the other and its all about what you chose if you chose to go with there opinion or not. when getting multiple opinions you can, find the better opinion, get a more positive outcome, and get a more opinions to pick from.

People tend to go to more then one person for advice to see what the other person thinks, some people go with just there gut or feeling but that just might not be the right way to go about things. Finding the better opinion about things is always the best way to go for anyone it can help you by helping you find the right way to go.

Getting advice from more then one person can get you a positive outcome and you can help yourself in the long run by people knowing the right opinion on things, Positive outcome can help you in the later run with other advice.

If you always only ask yourself for advice your not always going to get a positive outcome and can lead in a negative outcome. having a negative outcome can get people in a even worst spot and the advice that your getting is wrong.

By getting more opinions to pick from people can help you get the perfect advice. Getting more opinions to pick from can make your choice easier and make a better choice. The more opinions people get the more of a better choice people can make. making sure you pick the best choice you can get more opinion from other people. by getting your choice it can be hard if you just ask one person so people should at least ask 2 or more people.

It might be expensive, or it could just take up a lot of space.

Sometimes we only ask one person, and when doing this, we are making a huge mistake.

When you ask only one person, you are more prone to getting a bias opinion.

When someone has bias, it means that they are in favor of a something without any factual reason.

You think that people you know are not bias, but you probably believe the bias yourself.

If you have multiple opinions on the other hand, you are more likely to hear different viewpoints, which can help you make your decision.

An example of seeking multiple opinions is when I bought a fishing rod.

It's a very nice rod, and at the time this rod would subtract all of my Christmas money.

I had no idea whether I should get the rod, but what I did next helped me decide whether I would waste all my money, or if it would be money well spent.

I asked my Mother, who was with me at the store.

She thought that I would be wasting all my money, but she recommended that I speak with my Father.

I did what she asked, and lucky for me, he not only answered, but his friends were there with him.

They all gave me advice, and at the end said that it was a good deal.

I now had to consider myself why I should, and why I shouldn't buy the rod.

At the end, I decided to buy the rod, but it would have not been without the help of multiple people and their opinions.

Now you understand why multiple opinions help people make good decisions.

C29C7F7833BC,"Have you ever needed advice but did not know who to listen to or could not make up your mind? Well it can be very challenging not knowing what to do. By this it can be very helpful seeking advice from multiple people and not just one. Therefore, this could make your decission easier in a way. For example, a couple of people coul've said the same thing over whatever someone else might have said and that could help base your decission by knowing more people said the same thing than having different answers. Seeking advice from multiple people could help you because you could get different views on why or why not, it could help lead to a better decission by asking them, it could make you a more responisble person.

Getting different views on a decissions could not only be helpful but reliable by knowing everyone elses opinion and if you can agree or dissagree with it. For example, say you want pizza, but you want either pepperoni or cheese. You ask your friends and three of them say pepperoni and one of them says cheese. Which pizza would you choose? The one with the greater amount of votes and opionions on it or the one with one vote and less opinions. That's why getting multiple people for advice can be the number one helpful thing to do. However there are also other ways getting different peoples opinions on something is important.

Asking different people can help lead to a better decission than what you were planning on doing. For example, have you ever wanted to do something but didn't know if it was going to be the right choice to make. In that case what do you do? You ask your friends or other people and everyone is disagreeing with your choice and it help you to realize what the better choice could be. Prefferably it could've been the safer option or more responsible one so then after you say what a relief it is to know I made the better choice. Therefore, it helps you to realize the better or worse choices you could or could've made. Another good reason is one choice could be a more responsible choice.

By aksing multiple people about choices to make or which one to choose could also help you be a better person or become more responsible. On the other hand if you didn't you could possibly loose trust in the way you made your decission. By this I mean, what if your parents asked you a question and you didn't know if you should answer truethfuly or lie. You didn't get anyone elses opinions on it which could possibly and most likely lead to a better choice but you choose to lie. This is where you could loose trust on your parents knowing your not responsible enough to tell the truth. This could possibly be the case and this is why asking for multiple opinions could lead to a better response and could make you a more responsible person.

Seeking advice from multiple people could give you help because you could get different views on why or why not, it could help lead to a better choice by asking them, and it could make you a more responsible person. In some cases it may not always be possible to find somone to actually help you make a choice but it is definetly the better option to choose from. It can make your decission more reliable by knowing you have different opinions on your choices and build trust by being honest in an example I put in the last paragraph. The more improtant thing that can help is it helps you realize that that choice was better instead of another choice. Although, just because a choice has more votes make sure you agree because it's possible for the choices to not all be the best ones. That's why it's always important to always make sure you have your opinion invloved and not just someone elses opinion. Hopefully you can take this advice and put it into account to one day help someone else or you makea good choice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
04B6F07AC0EC,"Have you ever talked to your friend about something and he Disagrees with your advice while you might think he's advice isn't valid but people have their own opinion and some can change your thinking.:This article I will show you why multiple Opinions are just better than one , first giving multiple opinions can Reduce bad behavior, second multiple opinions can show you things you didnt know you had. Thirdly Multiple opinions are just better because 3 brains are better than one.

Multiple opinions can reduce bad behavior, because if you are looking for an advice and you listened to an advice you like you will stick to it. A example, someone tells you to cheat on a big test and your ready to do it when someone overhears you and say don't do it there is always a better solution than cheating and starts listing out facts and this other opinion can make a huge difference in your outcome and change your perceptive to cheating on a test. Personally I have dealt with bad advice but I always have good friends/family to stop me from doing bad things so this passage can show you why opinions are really important.

Why multiple opinions can show you things you didn't know you have ,to elaborate my personal experiences have shown that some of my advice that I get are pretty bad and some other advice can make you learn and broaden your horizons. A personal example of mine is when I was bored at home and my friends told me to either make some food for them or go out and play and i reluctantly made the food, when I did make the food it turned out great. When that happened I started cooking more and now its a hobby I loved that I never knew I had. This show that multiple opinions can show you things you didnt know you have.

Why multiple opinions are just better because 3 brains are better than one, in more depth multiple opinions can separate bias nous because other peoples opinion can have different ideology. If you did survey 3 people for advice on getting good grades probably the things they would have said was pay attention in class, do homework etc while there might be that one guy that says just cheat and don't listen in class. If this does happen you might think who is bias here while it depends on your standpoint if you already support cheating you will pick that guy so that will be bias but have you ever thought that maybe just paying attention and studying would help. If you did take that route you will have multiple opinions to lye on and that can overall dissipate bias nous and also you can switch stand point to see whats right for you. This can show your route what stand point you like.

After all of this I support my claim and my thesis multiple opinions can Reduce bad behavior, multiple opinions can show you things that you didn't know you had, Multiple opinions are just better because 3 brains are better than one. Multiple opinions can change your life for the better, If you give people opinions I hope Its good ones and I hope to see that people that are reading this implement it into their lives .",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
2E5633A79557,"Asking for advice from multiple people can make a better decision. It can make you lead to better life if it is a big decision, and if it is a smaller decision then it may effect you a smaller time, but maybe in a big way. Asking multiple people can help you in many different ways.

Seeing how others view the choice can help you see what you may have not seen before. Others see life and other things differently then yourself. If you want to start a sport, they may think they are athletic enough to play, but others may see different and suggest a different sport. You may catch on and find the best possible sport for them. This can help you have more fun and find new friends.

Another reason to ask multiple people is because you may lie to yourself and not make the best decision. If you ask only one person, then they may lie to you. Asking many people can make sure you get the best and maybe the most honest answer. For example, if you think you are getting over weight, you may want to go on a diet. You may then lie to yourself and say, ""I'm not that big, I can go a bit longer like this."" even though other people think you are overweight. You may then look at yourself and then start to go on a diet.

By asking many people then you can ""average"" the best decision for you. By taking a metal note of what people think you should or should not do then you can help yourself make the best possible decision. You can take a vote or just use multiple peoples opinion why not to and ask yourself again. By doing this, you may end up not lying to yourself and making a good decision. You may think your outfit is good while others don't, people might say just switch the whole outfit, switch the top, or switch the bottom. You can think to yourself again and come to a conclusion that you are just going to switch the top and nothing else.

One other is because making a bad decision can just make your life awful. For example, you may see a friend smoking. You then start to think that you want to try. If you ask yourself or that one friend that smokes, it can lead to you smoking. That just increases the risk of lung cancer and other diseases. This may lead to worse diseases or maybe death. But if you ask a few other friends or family then maybe you can will think twice and look ahead. This can help you lead to a healthier life in all.

Asking multiple people may help you understand what may happen. If we use the smoking example again, then it can help you understand what may happen to you can your life, internally and externally. Asking an ex-smoker can help you understand what happens to your life. How it effects friendships and family. How hard it may be to stop. Asking a professional about our bodies, like a doctor, then it can help you understand what may happen to use internally. How it affects our body in a bad way, or in a good way if it does produce any.

After saying all of this, we can come to a conclusion that asking multiple people is best. It can help you see in someone else's shoes. Or help you make a life changing decision. But in all, it helps you in some sort of way. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
15D2FF172210,"Do you ever regret choices? Everyone does at some point but, asking others for their opinion can save you from butterflies in your stomach. Seeking out multiple opinions can help you by learning more about your options, seeing different outlooks from people, and helping you make better choices. Asking for help is never a bad thing, it helps you be more confident on your final decision.

You can receive different outlooks on your choices. Each person's opinion is different and asking multiple people can allow you to get a variety of responses on that topic. Different opinions can easily change your point of view. Some people can be more passionate with their opinions. That all matters on the person, some may give you a one word answer while others may go on and on. The more people you ask, the more ideas you get for your choice. This could be overwhelming which is why you want to take your time on understanding the different aspects of your choices and what people have said. There is no minimum or maximum of people you may want to ask, it's all up to you, but the more the merrier.

It's not possible to know everything about everything which is another reason asking others can help you make a better choice. People have more knowledge on certain things and they may know a lot about it. This may help you become more comfortable with your choices, and hearing it through a conversation could be more beneficial than researching about it. It depends on what decision you're trying to make but, people may have a first hand background or experience with it and you may never know if you didn't ask. You have a lot of knowledge in things you don't even realize. Some things are tucked away deep inside your brain. Thinking more into a certain thing can help wake up that part of your mind more. In the end, people know more than you might realize.

More opinions can help you have less stress in the end. Opinions can teach you a lesson of how you may think next time a problem comes up. It could end with being an easy good decision or a long thought good decision. You'll end up more certain. Whenever you are put up with a task, you want to make sure your decision is going to be the best for everyone, not just yourself. You can gain a stronger personal opinion that can back you up in the future. You may disagree with everyone or you may agree with everyone, gaining the skill to agree and disagree is a strong thing to do! Stress is common and asking for people's opinions may just lower the amount you have.

Asking others for their opinion is a easy way to make better choices. Whether its learning something new, or having stronger mental health, asking is benefical in every way.     ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
07348A4B6E9C,"Is getting advice from people worth your time and energy? Why is getting advice helpful? Almost everyone, once in their life will need some advice. It can be advice for anything like school, relationships and sports etc. The advice can come from anyone like your dad, mom sister, brother and friends. In some cases getting advice can or may not be beneficial. Some people might give you good advice or bad advice depending the reason why you need advice.

Getting help from multiple different people will help solve your problem faster. If you get advice from multiple different perspectives, it will give you a broader point of view on how to solve your problem. Seeking multiple opinions will help you make a better choice. In addition talking to other people for advice it will help you make better decisions in the future. For example If someone needed homework advice, they might go ask their teacher for help or their parents for help. By doing that they can get two different opinions on how to do their homework, so now it is easier to complete the homework.

Another reason why asking multiple people for advice is good because, some people might have gone threw the thing you are needing to go threw. Therefore to ask multiple people you might find someone who is perfect to help you with your problem. The more you ask people they more experience you will get to make your final decision. So if you don't find the perfect person for the advice you can adjust some things and make it yours.

People who ask advice are people who are most likely going to succeed with there problem. I believe this became when people ask for advice they really wan't to fix their problem. Therefore If they want to fix there problem they will ask more people for advice. When you talk to more people for advice you will gain more knowloge on your problem, so maybe you can come up with your own advice to fix your problem.

Some people might ask advice for many different things but some people will ask for clarification. For example when someone has a question about the advice they have gotten they can ask for clarification. Clarification is a good way to separate good advice from bad advice. You might need ask multiple people for the clarification you need, which is better for you.

To wrap everything up, asking multiple people for advice will help you solve your problem and will help you in the long run. So asking will help you succeed in the future with other problems you might have. In addition people who have the desire to fix their problem will promblem get it done. So maybe next time when you have a problem you just might be able to fix it yourself.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
AB69A8EDFA20,"Do you ever ask more then one person for advice or help with decision making? Sometimes when people ask for advice they go to more than one person. This can help someone by giving them a selection, or they can see what others say or think.

Asking more than one person for advice can help someone by giving them a selection. By getting other peoples opinions or advice you can get more selection, so more advice you can choose from. By getting one person's advice you might think, ""Oh that is one way to do that, but I don't really like it that much."" By getting more than one person's advice you might think, ""Oh that seems like a better way to do that, rather than the other person's advice."" You might not be able to think of advice for yourself so you go to others, sometimes, you knew the advice all along but just need others help to really get to it. Having more than one person's advice is good, because you can select what is best fit for you and your situation at the time instead of only having one advice that fits, but not quite right for you.

Asking more than one person for advice can help someone by seeing what others say or think. When I ask for advice I usually do go to more than one person, because I like to think of what people say or think as a poll. The more people suggest the same thing thing I will tend to do the most suggested thing, or just do the thing that was suggested by someone that is really important to me and I respect their choices. By getting what other peoples thoughts or say in the matter they can change my mind or, give me reasons not to change my mind. This can put subjects for the advice up to debate, by disagreeing or agreeing with someone's advice. Getting peoples thoughts and opinions can really change and impact me, leading me to take a different approach to something, effecting me to pick different advice from someone.

To me, personally, I always go to people for advice because i'm indecisive and I respect others opinions. In conclusion, taking more than one person's advice is helpful by giving you selection to choose from, or by seeing what others say or think that affect the advice you choose. I wonder how people can come up with such good advice sometimes because it is hard to think of advice that others could take, are you a advise taker or are you a advice giver?",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

Every day we have to choose between many different things. Most people ask for advice on a number of things, but only talk to one person. When asking people for advice, I think that you should seek answers from more than one person because two heads are better than one, others can be unbiased, and you may not get the answer from one person.

If you have ever heard the saying, ""Two heads are better than one,"" you will know how true it is. Getting a second opinion is crucial when making a decision and could be a matter of life or death. It's important to seek council from more than one person in very many instances, in fact, I believe you should always get a second opinion on everything. Decision making is hard, but different people will have a unique standpoint on what you are asking.

Other people also might be unbiased. If you are asking for advice, it is important not to let bias get in the way. One person might be holding a grudge to something while others might not. Sometimes the answer you seek is not going to be one that you like, and bias gets in the way of deciding what's right. One person's grudge may be getting in the way of a choice, decision, or their advice. If you talk to two different people there is a less likely chance that a bias will be in the way of their advice.

Lastly, you may not get the right answer from just one person. Often times, you will not find the answer from the first person you ask. Actually, it might take several people to get the right answer. Normally, the answer will seem to just pop up, and it is probably not going to be from the first person you asked. Although it might seem to, advice doesn't come from thin air, and not even your most trusted friend will be able to just make it appear.

All in all, it really is important to seek advice from more than one person. From what outfit to wear, friend advice, or even what to buy, the safe option would be to ask more than one person for their opinion on the matter. I believe that you should ask for advice from more than one person because two heads are better than one, others can be unbiased, and you may not get the answer from one person. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
591E36982F38,"When asking for advice some people turn to just there best friend or there parents. They assume that what they are saying is the right thing to do and probably will listen to them and do whatever it is. This can lead people into arguments or bad situations that could go on for months. If you need advice for something you should ask more than one person so you have another persons perspective on your problem and here is why.

Advice can lead you into a good direction or sometimes bad. When asking for advice from someone you should go to at least two people. Some people could relate to your problem and know what not to do and what to do where as others you might ask cant relate to them at all. It would also give you the thoughts of ""these are the things they said to do"" youll then figure out which one you will decide to use in your situation. When asking someone for advice you might not want to ask anyone that your best friends with. They might tell you to do something that could get you in trouble, look bad, or possibly make them look good in front of everybody. When it comes to getting advice you always need to think about who you should ask for your own benefits.

In Some situations when you ask multiple people and they each give you the same response then that might be the right thing to do. You still might want to ask another person until they have a different perspective on how to solve your situation. One day your outside when a bully decides to push you off the swing. You dont do anything about it because hes bigger and stronger than you. When you tell your friend he tells you to punch him the next time it happens. You go home and tell your mom what happened and what your friend said to do. Your mother tells you that instead of doing that you should tell an adult what is going on before things get worse. You are left to think about whos advice to take in your situation, lets say you take your friends advice. The next day your on the swing when the bully demands you to get off so he can swing. You do as your friend said and punch him, the teacher sees that you have hit another student and you will be in trouble while the bully gets away with it all. Now lets say you take your mothers advice. You go to school the next day and tell your teacher about what the bully has been doing to you, she says she will watch during recces to see what is going on. That day the bully comes over to the swings and demands you to get off. When you tell him no, he pushes you to the ground and takes it himself. The teacher has seen what happened and confronts the bully. They bully gets in trouble and you can get back onto the swing.

Advice is something that everyone should think about before they do something or give advice to another. If you dont know what someone should do then its best you tell them that instead of giving them bad advice. Multiple people can give you multiple opinions of which you can choose what to do or whos advice to take.

I think that asking multiple people for advice and getting more of it is better than just asking one person and only getting one piece of advice.

I would want multiple peoples advice rather than just one persons.

When you ask for advice, you should ask multiple people because you'd get more out of it, you could get support on what you originally thought or you could see another view on the topic, and you would learn to talk better.

I think that you would get more advice from multiple people than just one person because you probably will.

You would get more advice if you asked multiple people instead of just one person.

It might not be the right advice, but it would be advice.

Say that you needed advice on what shoes to wear to a wedding.

You can ask somebody and they could say athletic shoes. Then you would be wearing athletic shoes to a wedding, that would not be very good.

Or you could ask multiple people, and they all say that you should wear nice shoes.

And now that more people have told you to wear nice shoes rather than athletic shoes, you will most likely pick the nice shoes.

Another reason on why I think multiple peoples advice is better than one persons is because you could get support on your answer or you could see another view on the topic.

You coulld get support on it because they could have the same advice as you originally thought about, or you could see another view because they could have a different side on it so they could give you a different piece of advice on the topic.

I think that that would help you a lot to either boost your confidence by somebody supporting you or switch your view and see other ways.

I think that you would learn to talk better because you would be talking a lot more to different types of people.

Different types of people could be different ages, different beliefs, or different genders.

I think that you would learn to talk a lot better from that because your talking to a lot of people and you are talking to different groups of people which would make you a better talker.

And you would need that because you would be talking to people for advice, so you need to be a good talker to get to them with what you are tring to say.

When I was about 11 years old my mom and dad divorced. My Mom and sister made the decision to move out of my Dads house because they were not liking it there. So they talked about it with other family members if they should leave or stay. When they were about to leave, my family asked me if I wanted to live with my Dad or live with my Mom. They gave me a few days to think about it. With those few days I asked my friends and other family relatives what should I do. They all gave me great advice.

D04C3774DA9D,"Many people only seek one to two people when asking for advice or an opinion on something. Here's why you should get at least 3 opinions of advice when in need. Its better to have multiple points of view than to just ask one person and validate their opinion fully. Its easier to feel closure knowing that multiple peoples opinions align and you can trust that your correct. It isnt sensible to trust just one person and hope that theyre right instead of knowing that a group of people is right.

Its easier to rely on when you ask multiple people or friends for advice. If you ask a friend for their opinion on a project youve been doing, and they dont seem as though they arent fully sure about what theyre saying yet they still give you an answer. Would you trust their answer and do what they said? I wouldnt, thats why you should attempt to validate your friends answer by asking multiple people multiple people who are qualified and seem like they understand what theyre saying. If you do this, even though your friends answer may be correct in the first place, youll have full closure knowing that all of the people you know have different backgrounds and understand different things better than others yet all of their answers matched.

Its better to have more points of view. If you sought advice about a history essay that youve written, you would ask for the opinion of someone who has a wide knowledge of history or a history teacher. If you wanted to know if you needed to change any grammar in your essay, you would ask an English teacher or someone who has a wide knowledge of the English language. You wouldnt want to ask a history teacher about grammar in your essay. That doesnt make any sense. This is why you would want multiple people who have different backgrounds and different opinions on things. Because you can ask certain people for advice on certain issues. This helps you know that what your doing is correct knowing that in every aspect of an issue that you have a certified of educated person in that field has given you advice or theyre opinion on something.

Its always smarter to have more than one resource when you need an opinion or some advice. Suppose your doing research for an essay your writing. You come across one website that doesnt seem very factual but its views align with yours. So instead of ending your essay research there and thats all the evidence you have, you decide to leave that website and go to other websites to do research on. If you would do that with computers and research, why wouldnt you do that with people and advice? Its always better to ask multiple people for advice and opinions on something.

All in all, just ask more than one person for advice. Weve learned that its better to rely on when asking more than one person. Weve also learned that its always better to have more than one opinion from people when you have an issue. Lastly, weve learned that its always smarter to have more than one resource when you need an opinion or some advice.

3319B3A22F9B,"Nearly 20% of all statements given are lies. Anyone at any time can be susceptible to one of these untruthful answers. Numerous test have been recorded in which they have found that regardless the question, people can, and will be untruthful at times. It does not matter if they are a friend, relative, family member, or classmate, they can lie. Whether it be a white lie or something more important, it is in our nature to tell false information occasionally. When asking for advice, I believe it is a good decision to ask more than one person about it because it can lead to a more accurate response, it can help people have more insight, and it can allow the person to see the situation from a fresh view.

First of all, asking multiple people can result in an accurate piece of advice. Asking just a single person can lead to poor results, if they are wrong. If the answer to the advice is major or life-changing, asking only one person can limit the chance of getting true advice. Everyone has different opinions on things, and if they ask only one person for advice, that can lead to conflict. Getting more than a single persons advice will most likely produce the most accurate responses.

Secondly, if only one answer is given, there is not much advice to take in. If only a single piece of advice is received, then the situation for which the advice was asked will not be much improved. Being able to go over all of the advice from multiple sources can give the struggling person a clearer mindset. Gaining multiple points of view over the topic can help the person reach a decision. If most of the people who were asked for advice come to the same conclusion, then that help to reach a final choice. Having more information to look over can allow for an improved, final decision.

The opportunity to have a different perspective over the situation can be a lot of help. Being able to have multiple people assess the situation and give you their advice can be used to an advantage. If someone is stuck with a decision that they have studied for a long time, it can help to have a fresh set of eyes to look over the decision and give you advice. For example, if someone is given an invitation to a new job, having other people look into it as well can provide thoughts and ideas that the person may not have even though of before. It can open their eyes to new possibilities and solutions. It is much smarter to ask more than one person for advice in order to obtain multiple perspectives and eventually come to a conclusion.

All in all, I think that having more than one person provide advice is the smart thing to do. By having multiple people give advice, the outcome can be more accurate rather than just having a single persons advice. Taking in advice from multiple sources gives more insight for your decision. Seeing and assessing the problem in a new light from other peoples views can produce the advice needed for that final decision. Based on fact and opinion, asking for advice from many people can lead to a much better choice. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
AC04DCF3041C,"In my opinion seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice of what to do, and what not to do. Another reason is that it can help someone not make the wrong choice in life. Another reason is that the first person they talk to might be trying to harm them so they tell them a bad decision. The last reason is that someone can help you become more successful than others can cause they might be trying to bring you down and other people are trying to boost the persons confidence.

Having multiple opinions can help someone not make the wrong choice. For example going out and hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into trouble. Another example is fighting cause your friends do it doesn't mean you have to do it. Like having a kid at a really young age can effect your life. So if I was this person I would seek multiple opinions.

If you seek multiple opinions people can tell you what and what not to do. Like smoking is really bad for you so you don't do it cause your friends are doing it, or because you think it's cool and makes you cool. For example my sister started smoking cause she thought it was cool but it wasn't and now she does it everyday, and it makes her look like a bad person. So take the right path not the wrong one.

Someone can help you become more successful if you listen to their opinion. Some people don't like to see other people successful so they say something that is going to bring you down. Most people want other people to be successful so they help guide them on to the right track or they help them get to the point of a successful life.

Therefore,just listen to other peoples opinions and maybe they can help you out to accomplish your goals. So don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something because you can do anything god lets you do.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
9B4313D769D4,"ÃÂ¨95% of all people who ask for advice from multiple people have a 90% chance of making a better choice then they would have if they had didnÃÂ´t,ÃÂ¨ according to the National Advice Orginazation. This is why asking multiple people for advice is better than just asking one person for advice, it also helps better desicion making, it helps with accountalbility, and it finally helps with confidence in the desicions made.

First of all, I think that asking multiple people for advise is better than just asking one person because you can get different opinions in things, like how the person feels or what they know about the topic. Asking people about the topic you are asking them about, it can also effect your choices you make. Mutliple opinions can change how you see about a topic, and can change your view about the topic/s covered or talked about. Multiple people will/can effect your choice about certain subjects, if you listen to them that is.

Second of all, I think multiple opinions can help account for accountability for choices you make with sed opinions. ÃÂ¨Opinions have strong influences, and those influences have strong outcomes,ÃÂ¨ says the Generic_City Times News Outlet. You have to be accountable for your actions and choices, if your not everyone will try to stay away from you. If you follow a certain speaker, or somebody on the internet and you are only seeing their opinion, they are influencing you and you need to see other opinions to get the full story.

Third of all, seeking multiple opinions helps build confidence in the decisions made. Seeking the opinions of multiple people can build the confidence in the decision that the person seeking sed opinions make. They help make the choices with better confidense then they would have without asking first. Asking for multile opinions also helps with whether or not the desicion should be made or not.

In conclusion, asking for multiple opinions can better help you out for better desicion making, accountability, and with confidense with sed opinions. Multiple opinions can influence you eithor in a good or bad way. It can also help with accountability with your actions. The multiple opinions help build up confidence in your choices. Overall, I think it is important to ask multiple people for their opinions because of the effect it could have, and the outcome of doing so. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
994898BB8EDF,"When people ask for advice,they are really asking someone a Question. That person will always get some type of an opinion from a person. If he dosent get an answer ,then that person might not want to talk to you or they could hate you. Many people ask or advice.

Why do people ask for advice? They ask for advice because they dont know how to do something or they wont know how to do something in the future. when you ask for advice you suppose to ask something that they have already did. like,ÃÂ¨ have you ever had a baby before?ÃÂ¨ Then your suppose to ask another question,and your next question that should be your advice.

Do you have to answer when somebody asks for advice? No you do not have to answer when somebody asks. you can be respectful and say I rather not answer it or can be disrespectful and just ignore the person. Then that person might ask you why not or they might mumble under they breathe and say that that was mean.

People can get many different opinions about something. You can also get many different opinoins form people. they can be right but they can also be wrong. That is why you have to be carefull about what ask and what you say,because you can say something wrong and someone might blame you for what you said. ",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
5008F4C9D932,"Eighty- nine percent of people go to others when asking for advice because they may be unsure of others opinions, want different perspectives, or they want many different opinions. Although most know what they want , and when they want it , others dont and need an outside perspective for someone else. Advice is something that many people give and take everyday. Although when some people who just want a different perspective on things tend to ask many different people about the same advice. However that reason is everyone has different mindsets, therefore there most likely are going to be a variety of thoughts and answers. Even if one may have the best influence, some still want to be able to have others ideas and thoughts out on the table.

1 out of every 3 people will go to multiple of their peers for intake and feedback on questions or advice . There are many varieties of advice relationship advice , professional advice ,and educational advice. So when it comes down to advice that people may be unsure on they will go to others for their feedback. Although not all advice is the best advice, most advice is good. Advice is advice someone can give and get. So its important to some people who want multiple faces of advice to ask multiple people.

Therapists are doctors some of the main sources of advice . Mainly because they care about their clients mental and physical health.

Maybe someones boss has to give them advice . Many people give advice multiple times a day .

While many people are giving advice sometimes the advice that they give has the wrong influence. Giving someone good advice can help others make good decisions for themselves . Also getting good advice can make yourself make better choices . Some dont remember that asking for help or advice is not as bad as it may seem . People think when they ask for help the are automatically weak and that is not true.

Asking for advice makes people make better decisions and helps them influence the ones who look up to them . ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
D08FD4520B2F,"Its better to talk to more than one person for seeking advice

A family member of mine was getting advice on a problem she had, and the advice didn't work but luckily she had more advice that ended up working for her. I think it's better to have more options when it comes to advice. Some reasons on why I think having more choices is better are because everyone is different, it makes people more confidant, and allows people to be less stress.

Today there are people from all around the world who have different personality traits, opinions, and even advice. In my opinion its better to talk to more than one person when seeking for advice because it just allows more options for people in the world to have. Having more options has worked for me in the past and will continue to work in the future. Everyone gives advice based on what helps them and people might be different than them. My best friend and I are completely different which shows that advice doesnt always work for everyone. Having more choices is always an amazing thing to have.

Being confidant is a very important trait to have in the world. Talking to more than one person on what they need help with allows them to be more confidant believe it or not. When having more options for advice helps people make a choice faster. A time I had to make a choice was when I was ordering at a restaurant, The waitress and my friends were all giving me advice on what I should get. Having that support made me choose quicker and didn't have to procrastinate. The process of getting advice, forced me to talk to multiple different people. That made me more confidant as a person by meeting and receiving different opinions/advice. Being more confidant makes me feel good about myself which is why other people should talk to more than one person if they need something.

When people don't procrastinate they tend to be way more relaxed and not have stress on them. Having more options tells the human mind to not worry. A time I felt not stressed was when I was throwing a surprise party for my friend. The reason I wasnt stressed in that moment was because I had a lot of options for theme ideas from different people. If it weren't for everyones ideas the party would have been a disaster! All of the ideas bonded into one huge theme and was the hit of the summer, everybody enjoyed themselves and loved the party. Having multiple ideas caused me to not stress a lot.

In conclusion, it's always good to carry around more advice than less advice from people because, everyone is different, it makes people more confidant about themselves, and people are less stressed when hearing from more people. In the future, I will talk to more people for their opinion, and this is my advice!",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
06C145EE7C45,"About 85% of views and or opinions are sourced to place of birth and family. Views from multiple individuals can be varying depending on who you ask, because family and place of birth has a very strong connection to what kind of views you have. Lets say you are from Italy and so is your family, you are most likely going to agree with a multiparty system and think that Italy is a very nice place, though others may think a multiparty system is bad and think where ever they were born is a very nice place. Though most opinions come from family and place of birth sometimes others have different opinions then their parents, because they see thing differently than their parents or other friends. Asking your family for advice is the first thing to do if your stuck or dont know what do to, even if you dont agree with them take their advice into consideration and use it to benefit you. Gathering advice in general is a good thing to do just in case something happens and you dont know what to do, but you have to ask more than one person and mix all their answers for it actually to be useful.

Surprisingly a lot of people take advice from one source and then try to make others feel the same way, but when they try this the person is likely proved wrong. Sometimes the person will be right when getting advice from one source, but this could be part of the person they are trying to convince is biased. Getting advice is something we all have done at one point, lets say you are having trouble with a specific topic in school and need some advice to help you pass. Getting advice from multiple points of view allow you to have more variety when it comes to certain topics such as; building something, using a product for some kind or problem, and when your unsure about a decision. Seeking multiple opinions from biased and non biased sources is something you have to look for, because some if not most sources are biased in one way or another. There are always two sides to something when getting advice weather it would be politics or everyday decisions. When you gather opinions from multiple people there is a higher chance for non biased answers, but biased answers are good as well, because if you combine two biased answers of opposite views you get a non biased view. Gathering more points of view is a good thing to do for almost any situation though sometimes one point of view is all you need.

However trying to get advice from multiple sources can be very lengthy and take days or weeks and could just lead to having nothing but biased opinions. Sometimes gathering information can take a very long time and could lead to useless results that cant be used. Your family and friends might also be too busy to help you with anything even if you really needed it. Even with all this knowledge that failure is possible you still have to try, because your family is very likely to help you out if you ask even if they have little to no experience on the topic. There are people experienced in specific fields as well which can be very helpful depending on the situation such as; if your father was an english major in colleage he can help you out if you need it. As is said before 85% of opinion comes from family and place of birth, which is why you need to ask multiple people for advice even if it takes a long time the information you gather can be very useful in the future.               ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
8D99FEDB5FE9,"When people ask for advice about something, they sometimes ask more than one person. Asking more than one person has alot of benifits for yourself. It's always good to have multiple choices about something. Second, Everyone has different opinions about situations. Someones advice could be better than somebody's elses.

Having a wide variety of options or choices is always a good thing. Hearing what one person has to say could make the situation worse or it could not help it at all. It's always good to hear what everyone else has to say about a situation your going through. In general, asking more than one person dosen't hurt.

Everyone has different opinions. Listening to more than one person makes you think more about the situation. For example, if your going through something that someone has already been through or is going through, they could relate more to it and give you pointers and also give advice to help you get through it. Someones advice could be a better choice than somebody elses advice. After all, always ask around for help if you need it.

Lastly, someones advice could make a situation worse if you listen to them. Dont always listen to one person. They could easily lie to you and tell you to do something that can lead to serious trouble. For example, if you and a friend were having friend problems and you ask your other friend for help on how to help the situation and they tell you to go fight the friend. You are gonna get a charge while the friend that told you to do it is gonna get no consequenes.

As a result, if the advice someone gives you dosen't seem right don't listen to them and go ask someone else for help.

I strongly agree that asking more than one person for help on a certain situation can make a person make the right choice instead of the wrong one. All in all, asking more than one person for help isn't always a bad thing. It's always good to keep your options open. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
98506F561E90,"Have you ever felt stuck when writing an essay, like you just can't move on from a sentence. Not knowing how to continue something your writing is normal. Everybody at one point or another doesn't know how to get past a sentence or two. How to get past it, is by getting multiple opinions. Getting multiple opinions on a topic gives you different viewpoints, it shows that you are open to new ideas, and it shows that you are able to rely on others.

When writing something, getting a different point of view can always make your essay better. Before starting your essay, you should always look at the two (or more) view points. As long as you know which side your essay is about you won't get lost when writing. When given multiple viewpoints, always address the other side somewhere in your essay. Whether its at the beginning or end of an essay or speech, addressing both sides show how committed you are to the topic and it means that people can't question whether or not you even considered the other side. If you're ever not sure which side you agree with, than list the pros and cons of each side. This will show how much you already know about each viewpoint, and what you need to research about.

If you're ever stuck on an essay asking others opinions can lead you to new ideas. Whenever I'm stuck on a essay or project I ask a friend, parent, or teacher for help. I show them what I have, and they give me advise on what parts that I can fix and things can be better. If someone says something that you think would be a good idea but you don't know when or how to use, write it down! No one is saying you have to use every piece of advice given to you, but make sure to at least write it down on a piece of paper, it might come in handy later. Asking for others opinions can give you some ideas for a better essay.

Asking others for their opinions show that you are able to ask for assistance. If you don't know something asking others show you're able to admit that you need help. Most people when they get stuck just sit there and won't even ask questions to other people. By doing this, they're saying that they would rather do poorly on the assignment, rather than admit their stuck. Asking a question doesn't mean you aren't smart either. It actually means you're smart enough to know when you need an outside opinion. When someone is giving you advice, even if you don't ask them too, don't act mean or snooty. This makes people not want to help you, and it doesn't work out for you in the long run.

Asking others for advice gives you different view points, new ideas, and shows that you can ask for assistance. Willing to get advice makes you look more like a team player to your colleges or fellow students, teachers, and employers. Taking advice will also give whatever you're working on something more. However, if you rely on other people to give you ideas, you might not be able to come up with your own ideas. As long as you know how to work on your own, you'll be good. So, I implore you to ask questions when you need it and get different viewpoints on the topic too, so your project will be the best it can be.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
73E2C823411B,"Why only seek one opinion when you can get multiple? People often go to more than one person for advice when they need an opinion. If you only seek advice from one person you might not be very confident in your choice. The more people you get advice from, the better choice you can make.

Although one persons opinion might feel like enough, its better to get many. One person might have a slightly bias opinion on a situation. They also might give advice they ends up helping themselves more than you. When you get more opinions it is a less likely chance that all the opinions will be bias.

Getting more than one piece of advice could also help you feel more confident when making a decision.

If you only get one persons advice then you likely will not feel very confident while making the decision and might not be happy with your decision later. If you get multiple opinions you can feel confident in your decision and not dread about how it might be a bad decision. Being confident in your decision will make you feel like you made the right choice.

Even if you get one bad opinion you do not agree with or think is a bad idea, it can help you see what choice you actually want and should make. When getting opinions you might be able to realize what you actually want and what would be the best decision. If you receive certain advice but do not like it, the opinion was still helpful to you because you can be more sure that you dont like that opinion and you like other opinions better. All together bad opinions also help with making good choices.

The more advice you receive the better choice you will end up making. More opinions will always help you feel more confident in your decision. Always seek more than one person for advice even if its not a major decision. Remember than all advice, whether good or bad, help you make the right decision.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
8AAB8EE320C1,"Don't you ever wonder why people ask several others for advice? It can be, to have several different ways to look at the situation, to have a different opening of the situation or to have a better understanding of the situation they are going through.

People may ask several people for advice so they can see several different ways to look at a situation. For example, I didn't know whether or not to move from New York to Virginia. So I asked my friends and they gave me plenty of pros and cons about whether I should move or not. So I took all of the advice into consideration and I moved. So asking several people for advice is a really good idea.

However, asking several people for advice can give someone a bigger opening to their situation. As an example, I thought only before about the cons of moving from New York to Virginia. Than I realized that here in Virginia their are way better academic and sports teams over here. This news from several of friends made me really happy. This is another great reason why people talk to several others for advice.

Lastly, talking to several people for advice can give people a better understanding of the situation they are going through. Normally even if i didn't want to move and my mom wanted to I would've followed hr either way. So my mom talked it out with me. Explained every little detail she should have and it gave me a clearer understanding o why we should move. I understood everything she told me and now i know why we should have moved over here. I was happy with the outcome and we knew we were ready to move.

F98964E3EBF4,"We all need help or an opinion on something from time to time, like writing a paper. When we go to get said opinion, we often ask multiple people. It seems like a simple and basic thing, which it is, but why do we do it? Well I believe people look for multiple opinions because the work can be more thoroughly checked, get approval from different types of people, and allows us to socialize with friends.

Having something checked multiple times decrease the chance that somethings wrong. Lets say that while reading an essay you wrote, whoever's checking it over might not notice a misplace comma or a chance to and a richer vocabulary. The more people that read it, the more likely those things will be noticed. Its a very basic concept that is sometimes overlooked. Always make sure to check your work multiple times to find its best form.

Having a variety of people look over your work is a great thing to do. The more people that get to put their two-cents into a work, makes said thing more likable. Like if your writing a short story and your friend who likes comedy gives you their ideas, and then your friend that is into mysteries gives you some tips to make it more suspenseful. There, thats two people with two different personalities and liking's that agree that your story is good. Its a great way to make a story that appeals to a lot of people.

Humans are naturally social creatures. We like to talk to each other a lot, and for good reason. Having a casual conversation with a friend often feels calm and unstressed, clearing your mind. If your really feel unsure about what your creating, having an off-topic conversation with a friend can help you make better choices for what you making. Tranquility is often the key to success.

So why do we look for multiple people when we want advice. It allows us to check our work multiple times to eliminate any mistakes. We can make our work more likable by more people. Finally, talking to people we know well can help us work more efficiently and relaxed. You can make anything ten times better, just by asking for a little help.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

They ask them because it is helpful to have more than one opinion on something .To fully make sure they are 100 percent about what they are doing .And that it is the correct choice .It is always helpful to get more than one opinion because it helps to get someone elses point of view, to make sure your doing the right thing ,and its just always helpful to get advice on things.

One reason it is helpful to ask for more than opinion when you are making a decision is because it is always helpful to have someone elses opinion from a different perspective. That is helpful because if you are making a decision and you ask someone for their advice about it they might see it from a different way and give you a better decision to make. For example when I am making a choice I usually always ask my friends because people see and think things different ways .That is why I always ask my friends or family or family because due to experience it is always helpful in the end .Doing this will usually come out with a better outcome.

Another great reason to ask for opinions from multiple people is because you want to make sure you are doing the right thing .You might have chosen to do something not so good but then you ask other people for their opinion and they say well you know thats not really the best idea so instead you choose the right thing to do .Which is very helpful because peoples advice may lead you in the right way. For an example one time I was going to make a decision that wasnt the best but then I asked my best friend what she thought and she told it was not a good idea and I shouldnt do it. Which is why it is always helpful to ask for peoples advice on things before doing it because it might be a bad idea.

Finally another reason it is helpful to get more than one opinion on something is simple is that it just helpful to hear another persons opinion .Due to experience people tend to make better choices if they hear advice from other people. People tend to do the right thing when others agree with them .For example if someone has made a decision to do something and then they ask someone for their advice about it and they agree. That person is going to have a confidence boost about what he or she is doing because others agree.

In conclusion when in doubt ask it out meaning if you are not sure about something or even if you are .You should always ask for other peoples advice about something.

EBD98D754ECD,"There have been times in our lives when we have to make decisions, its part of being human. Choices come in many different forms, whether it is buying a car, purchasing a house, or splurging on ice cream. We all have to make up our minds and roll with it, but sometimes we dont know if what we chose was the best decision. Just remember that there is no shame in asking for help, and if anything it is necessary to get multiple opinions so you can make a decision that is financially benefiting, or delicious!

Getting multiple opinions can really help if you accidentally wrecked your car and need to see a mechanic. Some professionals may be cheaper or get the job done better than others. Without multiple opinions on important things like this, you could end up paying a lot more for a tire than is necessary, or you could end up paying way too little for a bad engine part that will require you too pay even more on repairs.

In addition to cars, your house can be a great thing to get multiple opinions on. Furniture, maintenance, and home inspectors are all things you need, but could end up costing a fortune. Furniture can be expensive, and something you have to live with, and if you only go with one opinion you could end up with ugly and uncomfortable furniture for your home. Dont be the guy who gets back from work and has to deal with an itchy couch all afternoon. Also, home inspectors are very important. They detect radon and help you prevent it, so you dont get lung cancer or future health problems. If you go with a bad home inspector you could end up with a bundle of hospital bills that will never go away. But it doesnt end there, home repair and maintenance can a be a hassle. Like buying a new roof, getting a new washing machine, or adding a balcony. These can be expensive and if you dont ask people where to go to get the job done, you could end up spending way too much. You dont want to be stuck in a hotel for more than is necessary while bad workers take their dear sweet time adding that long awaited second floor.

Additionally, one scenario we can all relate to is buying ice cream. Standing there while the line is growing and your still trying to decide on the mint chocolate chip or rocky road, or going to the grocery store and arguing with your little sister over which flavor you are gonna get. These can be embarrassing and can both be avoided by asking somebody for their opinion to help choose better. If you are lucky, you could end up with a delicious new flavor you never knew you loved.

These are all things that could cost us more than required. So next time you have to make a decision, get multiple opinions and dont just settle on good. Remember it isnt bad to ask people what they think of something so you dont mess up big time. There is always a cheaper or better option that could save you money, or make you a happier person.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
AAFE0E511953,"Have you ever had to ask for advice from someone? Asking for advice from someone can sometimes be the best thing you could have done. Because maybe if you didnt ask for some advice you could have messed up or if you were planing something for someone you could have done the wrong thing if you didnt ask for advice. For example your throwing a surprise birthday party for a friend but you dont know what they want for their birthday so you can go ask one of their really close friends so you can get some advice on what they like.

One of the most common place people ask for advice is the store because the person wants to know your advice on something they dont know about. If someone ask you for advice on what brand cereal is the best you might recommend the ones you think are the best. But if there going with something healthier like what kind of fruit is the best for you you can tell them what you think is the healthiest for you. Giving advice to someone involves having an opinion on something like what your favorite ting to do outside is or what you like do do on your free time because when someone is asking for advice they want your opinion on the situation.

Getting more than one person to help you on advice is a very helpful thing to do because they can fill you in on what they think about the topic. Some people you can ask are your close friends,family,and a therapist if your having some questions. Some times you dont have to ask for someones advice but its best if you do because they can give you their input on it and you might change your mind.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

845A0E7E3013,"Have you ever been faced with a tough decision and didn't know what to do? Have you ever asked different people for advice to help you make your decision? Well I have, and here's why you should too. Seeking multiple opinions can help me make a better decision because of the different perspectives it provides and the new ideas brought to the table that I never would have thought of previously.

The various perspectives different people have on situations can provide me with better choices to make. All of the different things people experience give them multiple opinions on what to do in certain situations. The difference in someone's background on a situation will contribute to a difference in their opinions. For example, if someone has already experienced a similar situation to they one they are being asked about, their background knowledge on the situation will make their opinion more helpful. Seeking out multiple opinions can help me to root out the people who have already experienced something similar to me. This can help me make better decisions because of all the different things they have experienced going into the opinion that they give me. Another reason why seeking multiple opinions can help me make better choices is the different ideals everyone favors. Everyone has certain ideals that they think are the most important factor to consider when making a decision. An example of this is when one person thinks a decision should be made based on facts and logic, while someone else thinks that a decision should be made based on compassion and how it will affect others. This difference in ideals shows a vast difference in opinions, which provides me with a greater variety of opinions when I ask different people for their advice. Getting multiple opinions from people can help me to get a broader range of experiences, background, and ideals going into a decision.

The options that are brought to my attention that I never would have thought of without the help of others are a main reason why seeking out multiple opinions from different people can help me make better decisions. A fairly recent example of this is when I was faced with the decision of what classes to take for my electives in high school. One of my elective spots was already taken up by Spanish class, but I was in between two classes for my second elective. The first class I was considering was choir. The second class I was considering was called introduction to business and marketing. I had no idea what to choose, so I asked my mom, my dad, and my sister what they thought I should take. When I asked my mom, she said that she thought I should take choir because I would already be so stressed with all of my other classes, so I didn't need another challenging class like introduction to business and marketing. My dad said the exact opposite, which is that I should take introduction to business and marketing because he thought choir was a silly class to take. Finally, I asked my older sister what she thought I should do. She said that I should choose choir as my second elective, drop study hall as a class, and take introduction to business and marketing instead. If I hadn't asked my older sister her opinion on the situation, I never would have known that I could take both classes. This story shows just how important it is to get advice from others about what to do in different situations because of the various solutions I can be provided with in the process.

All of the different perspectives and new ideas I am given to apply to situations that I never would have thought of otherwise, shows why asking various people for advice can help me make a better and more productive decision. In the future, I will definitely continue asking different people their opinions in order to make the best choice I can in any given situation.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
C0D0428510D5,"Seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because some people have bias opinions on different topics, some people aren't educated on certain topics and others are, and you can learn and understand more about both sides opinions, and why exactly they feel that way.

People have bias opinions on certain topics for many different reasons. Being bias means that you feel strongly about one side of something. For example, Republicans and Democrats, most people that are very into politics are normally bias about the side that they are supporting. Some reasons why people are bias is because of the way they were raised or maybe the reason is where they were born. Whatever the reason is, people can be very bias.

Some people aren't very educated on certain topics depending on if they actually care or pay attention to the topic. For example, some people really get into politics, pay a lot of attention to it, stay updated, and talk about it a lot. On the other hand some people don't really get into it very much and don't pay to much attention to it. It really all just depends on how the person truly feels about it, and how important the person thinks it is.

Asking for other peoples opinions about a certain topic is a good way to get to know more about both sides, and learn how and why they feel about certain things. Some people might feel one way about something, and another person feels the exact opposite then how the other person feels. In that case, you get to hear and learn about how both sides feel, and why they exactly they feel that away about the topic. It's good to hear both sides because your opinion might completely change, or maybe you'll begin to start having a more neutral opinion about the topic.

In conclusion, seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because some people have bias opinions on certain topics, some people aren't educated on certain topics and some people are, and finally you can learn and understand more about both sides opinions, and why they exactly feel that way.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

Asking for questions is better than staying quiet and not knowing. When you ask mulitiple people for help, you can get a wide variety of answers that will help answer your question. For example: When I had difficulty learning a unit in math, I asked multiple friends and got multiple answers that helped me learn it. Asking one person alone can get you answers but asking more people is better because maybe if you ask one, they could be wrong and all the others could be right. For example: I asked my friend the answer to a question, he was wrong but I asked my other friends and they were right. When you are seeking for help try to ask questions.

People ask multiple people for opinions and go with the majority. One reason is, they usually don't have much time or have better things to do.

95D847FEBF38,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. People looking for advice ask more than one person to see others opinions. Asking for multiple people for advice can help you see how others would handle the situation. Three reasons you should ask for more than one persons advice are people handle things differently. Different people will give you different advice, and other people might have been in the same situation before.

One reason to ask multiple people for advice is people handle things differently from each other because everyone is different. Some people will handle things a certain way, and others will handle it a different way. Asking multiple people for advice helps you see what others would do in that situation. If you ask one person they might give you one way to handle it, and then you ask a different person and they give you a different way to handle it.

The next reason to ask multiple people is people give different advice. Some people might say to fight to solve a problem, and then others will say to talk it out. Depending on the situation you could get in trouble if you handle it wrong. Some people also might give bad advice to see if you do what they say. Others will give you good advice to try to help. Some people might know how to handle a situation that you're in, and others might not.

The third reason to ask multiple people for advice is some people might have been in the same situation. If you only ask one person you could get advice from them; but they might not have been in the same situation. If you ask multiple people you could get advice from multiple people on what to do, and someone might have been in the same situation. If someone was in the same situation before they might know how to handle it better than others. If someone has been in the same situation they will have better advice.

That was three reasons to ask multiple people for advice. The three reasons where people handle things differently, different people will give you different advice, and other people might have been in the same situation before. It is better to get advice from multiple people because not everyone thinks the same. If you get advice from multiple people you will get different advice, and different ways to handle the situation.

Kids often think they can help but infact can make matters worse.

People should ask multiple people for advise because some people are much more wiser. They know what they are doing and know hoe to help out. They can help with making tuff choices for tuff situations. They can also help you on living a fun and safe life. Dont be scared to ask for help.

People might have gone through the same situations as the person in need of help. They can teach them how to prevent bad things happening. How to make life more fun and opened. How to make life interesting and successful and even. How to feel free.

2189471C5C78,"The reason people make mistakes,the reason why they have mostly opinions,and the reason why there is some bias. Some good reasons for people to ask multiple and not one person is to see what there point of view looks like and to take out some opinions .One example for this is if your friend says something like chuck y cheese is the worst, that would be an opinion and it would make a bad article, but on the other hand if your friend would have said reasons why chuck y cheese is the worst than that would back up your statement, by saying something like,One reason chuck y cheese is bad is because of the health conditions and list examples to back up the statement that was made.

Some other reasons why its good to ask more than one person is because people have different mindsets than others,Which also leads to people thinking differently. What I mean is something like,some people have better writing and talking abilities than others. For example you ask someone why a certain topic like stretching before running is good someone might say,

""Because it's easier to run"", and someone else might say

""One reason you should stretch before running is because if you stretch, your muscles will be loosened and more relaxed and there would be less of a risk of getting a cramp"". the second person actually used facts about what will happen and the first person only said one thing that was not specific.

Another reason is that if you dont ask more than one person you won't be able to add even more facts like if someone said, a fact you really liked and you dident ask anyone else and you make an article about it you wont be able to write as much on the article if there is only one thing you can write about. Which could also lead to the article looking way to short and the public wont want to buy it because of the little amount of work that was put into it. And if you ask more than one person it could probably change your point of view or your opinion about the topic. like if you said sharks are cute someone else could say, they might be but some things about the shark are that they have a really large mouths,really sharp teeth and some more stuff which might either lead the person to think about why before he thought sharks were cute and now say they are really dangerous or just keep saying the sharks are cute because you have not been anywhere near them yet. because some people know more things than others because of what they might have learned in the past that you havent learned yet. or just things that have to do with religion and where you where born.

Another good reason on why to ask more than one person is because if you dont know the person very well you might not know how smart the person is or if they are lieing to you, So if you go to more than one person and they basically all say around the same exact thing, Than whatever the first person said you will know that they were correct about what they said and after you ask the people go on the internet and search about the topic and if there are any words that sound familiar than you will know that you are 100 percent correct.

Another thing which is something that im pretty sure I already mentioned but want to back it up is that if your not quite sure on how to like publish a book and you ask more than one person you might learn something new and then if someone ask you how to do it you wont just say I dont know anymore you will be saying I absolutely know how to do it which could als help people find or look for jobs. and something else is that if your doing something that is illegal and have friends that dont do it and you want to stop but dont know how to you can maybe ask more than one friend on how to stop which could help you later on becaus you would have multiple ways to stop whatever your doing,

Instead of only one way that maybe you think is really risky and have to take a chance. Which could really help someone out with their life because you ask somone how to deal with it and you dont like the idea then you can to to your other friend and ask him.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
2F79AEAA8009,"What do you do when you need advice/opinion about something? Do you go ask the advice of one person or multiple? For me, seeking advice from multiple people would be a more reasonable thing to do than to ask one person their opinion on a topic, and many other people think the same for the reason that it helps them make a better choice. Asking more than one person for advice will help you make a better choice, because you'll learn from people lives, grow as a person, and get reassurance.

First off, you learn from the lives of others. People have different life stories and when you take the time to listen to them you can learn from them and have it influence the choices you make to be better. If you ask multiple people for advice about something you'd get a diversity of responses, because of things such as age, gender, cultural background, religion, ethnicity, and class which effect the way people live daily. My grandpa was a poor man from Honduras who smoked, drank, and did many other things. He died many years ago from lung cancer. I never got to meet him, because he had made the decision to smoke when he was alive. I'd hear stories of him from my mom when I was younger and I've been using those stories of my grandpa to help me make better choices.

Secondly, you grow as a person. To me the brain is like a seed and opinions are like water, and seeds need water to grow. So when you receive advice/opinions from others you brain grows, not literally, but it grows in wisdom and knowledge. Especially receiving advice from people who are older in age and people who have who have been through a lot, such as people who've been in war are much more wiser, because they've experienced more things than others. Getting advice from people will help you build character. In the way that you will mature, because you'd learn more things about life. Also it would help you learn to be able to see different peoples point of views, which can help you make a better choice, by being able to see the outcomes of the choices you pick.

Lastly, you will get reassurance. Lets say you like this dress and you try it on. You ask your friend for their opinion and they say it looks good, but you'd also like to know what other people think about the dress so you ask the workers at the store and they politely say that is doesn't look good on you. Would you have taken the dress based on your friends opinion or the workers? I'm pretty sure no one would have taken the dress if they got negative opinions from people. Honesty, when I get a compliment from someone I ask other people if its true, because one persons opinion isn't enough for to me believe something, So basically I feel that people ask others for their opinion for the same reason.

In all things considered, receiving advice from multiple people can help you make a better choice, because you learn from others, you grow as a person, and you get reassurance. Getting opinions from people of different backgrounds and ages can effect the way you think and can influence the choices you make to be better and to feel ensured that something that the choice your picking is a one that will benefit you in the long-run. So next time you are in need of advice or need peoples opinions go ask your friends, family, teachers, and others, because they will help you make a better choice, and just know that you don't always have to do something because you feel the need to satsfy people do it because you feel it will do good for you.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5ABF45343C00,"""HEY, WHAT TO I NEED TO DO!"".

People often attain confusion, but why be brain stumped just ask friends, family, or even your co-workers for their opinion. It is excellent to ask a question if you cannot decide what to do, but you do not have to be embarrassed just because you asked a question. You never access knowledge unless you ask a question. There are three reasons why you need to ask for multiple opinions you can have a variety of choices to choose from, you do not have to make a poor decision that will leave you with a lifetime flaw, and if a plan that you tried multiple times fails, you will always have a back-up plan.

First, the idea of having multiple choices is an excellent idea. Its similar to deciding what restaurant you crave, Longhorn Steakhouse or Outback Steakhouse. Longhorn may attain lower prices, but Outback attains outstanding quality. Also, having multiple choices endures the responsibility of constructing your own choices. Choices are based off of assumptions and also what ones' reactions are, one is more remarkable than the other, that one has a more outstanding design, or this one has a astronomical quality. Choices are difficult to make, but they will not kill you.

Secondly, making poor decisions can always be costly, somehow and someway. Constructing a poor decision is either going to finish outstanding or in an extreme consequence, think of it as your going to end up in Heaven or Hell. Heaven, finishing outstanding, is going to be an excellent life, while Hell, finishing in an extreme consequence, is not going to turn out so excellent. When having multiple opinions make sure you decide on the correct opinion and not the one that will strand you on an island.

Finally, it is always excellent to have a back-up plan. When your primary idea, plan A, does not always have an excellent ending make sure you have an intermediate plan, plan B, in reach. You will not always finish first in life, but as long as you attain an excellent back-up plan, you will have an excellent chance of doing so.

Think of it as Trump, every time he fails he has another plan just in grasp.

In conclusion, it is an excellent idea to have more than one opinion on board. It may never work out the way you wanted it to, but that is how life is, not fair. Just make sure you have another opinion in grasp, just like Trump. Yet, choices are tough, bitter, or disatorous, but as long as there are mutiple opinions we will make it through life.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
D72C6FB455A0,"hearing about more than one persons opinion on a specific subject can broaden your knowledge on that subject. asking people can also tell you things about that subject. it can also help you with either a project or if you just want to learn about it. doing this can also tell you about strategies. you can also combine multiple strategies together if you want.

however this might also confuse people as the advice could either blend in or sound not good at all. sometimes speaking to only one person is better as you have one plan and can think if it will work or not. not all plans will work as they might only work for a specific thing. also don't always rely on other peoples ideas as they might not be around when you need them. but asking for others advice is a good way to solve something if your having trouble with something.

asking multiple people can be a even better help as you have more plans and have more to go off of than just one. asking more people also means you have more support. doing this like this can help you with a essay, a book, a movie, a game or a speech. you can however just solve the problem by yourself as other peoples advice might not work out for you. you have to remember that going around asking people for advice might not always be the best solution.

some people can't find solutions that easily by themselves so thats why asking others can be a good backup option. it can also be helpful if your doing something you don't know how to do but there are people around you who do. for some people however they don't have this option because of things like them being antisocial or them not being able to talk. others might just not like talking to people they don't know. others however might have this self pride and not want any help.

asking others for advice might also be a bit annoying. you might not find anyone who can give advice. there is also the possibility that everyone has the same advice but it's not good for what your trying to do. even with all of those problems asking for advice is a very good thing to do. so if your finding something hard or frustrating just ask someone for help.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
94C450F5F6FF,"Everyone needs a little help with something and often times turn to one person for that help but having more options is better. Seeking advice is always the right thing to do when you're unsure about something. When you hear things from multiple people it gives you different views from everyone. Even if you have one person that you go to, there could still be something that they can't help with too. That's the main reason why its good to have more than one outlet, because you""ll have different views on a situation and look at it differently.

Seeking multiple opinions can change your response to things. Picture it like you want to purchase an expensive dress but you need that money for a gift to your mom. Buying the dress would make you happy but then your left with nothing for you mom, so you turn to your best friend for advice. She says not to buy the dress but you're still conflicted on the options. Then you go ask more friends they all say to not buy it except one. That one friend tells you to find a dress that cost a lot less so you can have leftover money for the gift. If you would've stuck to the first opinion you would not have explored another option.

In other ways it can change your mindset on somethings that you may think are right. If you want to go out and party a lot other people maybe think thats not a good idea. Opinions can influence you coming from the right people. Getting them from various people can mean a lot more than it seems,Like if your family does not want you to party but your friends do. You should listen to your family because they're making their opinion out of love, however your friends are not. Always listen to where people are coming from when asking for advice because people tell you things mostly off of experience.

If you ask the wrong people for there opinions they will influence you to make the wrong choices. Don't go with the majority option, go with the more rational one. Choose the options that sound more thought through than just a quick answer of what someone thinks because a lot of people may try to hurt you more than help you. You should always try to do the right things or find an alternate way to be able to do both of your choices. Even when you ask other people you should still incorporate your own opinion into the situation and use theirs to add on to what you think.

Overall having more opinions is good because if you only have one you dont have all of the options in your mind. Getting too many might make you more confused and cause you to get off track so you have to find a balance in between. Also look out on who you get them from, some people may try to steer you down the wrong path on purpose. Don't disregard what people say either because it may matter in the future. Those are the reasons why seeking multiple opinions can help you make better choices, because everyone's opinion should matter.                           ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

""Well I have a little bit of a situation, and I can't really figure out what to do."" said Generic_Name disappointingly. ""Okay... What's the situation?"" Generic_Name stuttered. ""Alright, so I caught Generic_Name hanging out with another girl last night, but he said nothing happened. I don't know if I should give him a second chance or break up with him. What do you think I should do?"" Generic_Name explained. Generic_Name stopped right in her tracks and glared at Generic_Name. ""Generic_Name, ARE YOU KIDDING. He was with another girl that wasn't you! That's a clear I don't wan't to be with you kind of act!!"" Generic_Name yelled. Generic_Name sighed, ""I know but it was really unlike him, and I trust him completely."" Generic_Name rolled her eyes, ""Well if it were me, it'd be over."" Generic_Name nodded her head, ""Well, I'm going to ask Generic_Name what she thinks before I take action. I just need to get a second opinion before I make a decision."" Generic_Name sighed, ""Okay, let me know what happens.. I hope you make the right choice."" Generic_Name said goodbye to Generic_Name and walked to her car. Later that night she called Generic_Name. Generic_Name told Generic_Name the exact opposite of what Generic_Name said. Generic_Name said that if it was very unlikely that he would do something like that, then she should tell him that if it happens again its over. Generic_Name agreed with Generic_Name's way of thinking. So that is exactly what Generic_Name did. There are a lot of situations out there where people are feeling exactly how Generic_Name felt, cold and lonely. Like if that choice they had to make would lay out the rest of their life. But if Generic_Name didn't get a second opinion then she could've lost her relationship. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it could save potential friendships and relationships, it could prevent dangerous activities from occurring, and it could open the eyes of anyone who needs help making a hard decision.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it could save potential friendships and relationships. First, having friendships and relationships throughout life is extremely important. They create happiness, and I'm sure everyone needs people to lean on sometimes. For example, my friends Generic_Name and Generic_Name. They are and have been my best friends since I can remember. We have traveled the world together and all of my best memories are with them. However, arguments happen sometimes, and if an argument happens between close friends you should always get a second opinion. Because life can be so different and miserable without them.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it could prevent dangerous activities from occurring. First, before anyone does anything remotely dangerous they are going to tell someone about it. Whether it is drugs, alcohol, or even shop lifting. They are going to ask a close friend if they should do it. For example, my cousin was telling me about a time her friend almost drank at a party. Her friend asked her if she should do it, and of course my cousin said no. My cousins decision prevented a lot of dangerous acts that could've gone down that night. In conclusion, second opinions can save people in these certain situations.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it could open the eyes of anyone who needs help making a hard decision. First, whenever you have a hard decision to make you would most likely ask someone else either if its correct, too long or too short, or if it looks good perhaps. For example, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and I went dress shopping last weekend. She asked us both how we felt about each dress she tried on. Although her opinion was still valued, our opinions were also incorporated with her decision on what dress was the perfect dress for her. However, sometimes Generic_Name and I both had different opinions which made the situation harder. In conclusion, a second eye could really help an outcome of a situation.

All in all, second opinions are extremely important. Whether it comes to dangerous situations or even fun situations. When people ask for advice, we should always give our absolute honest opinion. In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it could save potential friendships and relationships, it could prevent dangerous activities from occurring, and it could open the eyes of anyone who needs help making a hard decision.        ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
4BB688100D15,"Imagine you receiving advice from someone, but you go ask other people because you're not sure if it's considerable. What I would do in this situation is to not ask one person for advice, I would go to other people and listen to their opinions. Just by listening to different people's perspective you gain more information to help you find a reliable solution. For me, that is the correct choice because it makes more sense to absorb others advice to find a better choice. I believe everyone has the opportunity to seek others opinions to make a better choice by involving others, being curious, and relying on your peers.

By involving others, you can learn a lot of new things just by including multiple opinions. To involve other people you can start off by asking for their point of view, so they can end up changing your mind about your situation for something better. You could also involve others by using their opinion, and ask different people about that person's perspective, and see which one would lead you to make a final choice. Finally, another way to involve others to seek a better choice is by expressing your own opinion, and talking to another person to observe your opinion. I find these ways better to trust, so you don't have to involve only one person.

Being curious helps you find a better belief about a situation you are not sure of. To be curious you could go up to people for advice, and possibly give them options to see which one has a better meaning. On the other hand, you could be curious by listening to what is important or not, and by asking for examples if you don't quite understand. Asking multiple questions of the person's advice and finding the pro's and con's of the situation is another way of being curious. Being curious is the key to lead you to the right path to find a better choice.

Relying on your peers can help you find a better understanding of their advice. An example of relying on others is to build trust with a variety of people to make sure you know that person will give you a positive result. Another way to rely on your peers is to make sure you know them well enough to ask them for advice, and so that you don't go the opposite way of making a consistent choice. However, relying on your peers will make you feel more confident about their opinions, and consider making the right choice. Relying on others will help you follow success by considering others perspectives.

Overall, I think listening to other people's point of view is the key to help you make a better choice. Using your peers and your surroundings will get you to the right path. To make better choices, and using the opportunity to seek opinions is to involve others, be curious, and rely on your peers to find your solution. Have you ever thought about talking to other people to find reliable advises? Do you think this will help in the future as well?",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Anyways it would be good for people to have mutiples opinons to go through and to search for because not everyone is gonna give you the right advivce some people are gonna give you the wrong but you have to work through it to try to make it work cause you are gonna need peoples opinones sooner or later but from the right people not the wrong cause some people are set up for failer and you dont wanna be that peron you want to be bright and succed in life like most people AND GROW up to be something in life so the path i would take if i were you is to succed and grow and work hard for my goals.

Me personally I like to view from other peoples perspective because you dont wanna make a mistake in your life your gonna regreat cause if theres one thing I learned you dont always have second chances people are gonna push you to do bad things thats why you make sure you have people that care about you people that are whiling to be there for you push you in the right direction to do better be better and eventully your gonna appreaite those poeple and the people that gave you such good advice and there opinions will mater at that point.

Also, there can always be that one person im not saying to keep your circle small what im saying is everyone is not always gonna give you the right directions people can be really mean or rude to a point where there gonna give you the wrong responce your not gonna wanna hear cause there are people that are jelouse of you or that are mad that you will make it somewhere in life and that they wont cause they decided to contuine to do the wrong things evenully thats not gonna help you its gonna make you do bad in life and not be able to do the things you wanted to do but its to a ponit you cant control what you are people do anymore if you wanna drop out of school then thats your choice cause reamber you are always gonna regreat later in life what you did cause you dont wanna be they non smart kid or woman you wanna be the perosn everyone talks good about cause people are gonna want you more and there gonna look at you and be like hey she finished school now shes working on her career and that is good that is somothing you want your family or person to talk good about you things.

Thats why I think its best to get peoples advice from more than one peopson so you can be able to seek peoples attention and choce what opinions can help more to make better choices . To work hard and apperiate the people that are there for you and that want to be there cause im telling you its hard to find people like that but you have to look cause all those wishes and blessings will come your way eventully i promise not everyone is gonna fail in life they will succed like most people in life and im sure and you that you want to be one of those people and reach high for your goals and do well hard work pays off thats what my parents always told me everything i push you to do today will pay off and you will thank me later on in life so yes push hard work have and do what is right for everyone and you will see the results later and be pround that you listened to the people that was there and the ones that wanted to be there and support you through your desions and push you to be a hard working person cause will appreate that soon I promise just stay bright and think before you do thats the key and challenge your self that you are here and can do and most desions that some people cant have cause of the desions they wanted to make in life to be great but they got around the wrong crew and desided to take advice from some people that didnt want it and never listend but still did wrong but anyways do what is right and listen to the opions people give you and try to sove your problems and always choose the right people to take advice from cause it will pay off and come out right but thats why in my OPIONE it is good to listen and take good advice from people that need it and you choose which one is right and to listen to and it will take you far in life I promise stay bright and thoughtful of what you do and go around cause not everyone is gonna push you in the right path but you have to choose to go and follow that right path or you wont get anywhere but you want to do good and have people amaze you for the things you did ,the work you have done but theres that and my resons why you should take opiones from the people that care for you.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
CDE03944D26E,"Have you ever made a bad decision in your life and regretted it? I have had many friends make the wrong decision and hang out with the wrong crowd and they get punished for it. I have also had friends that make good decisions and hang out wit the right crowds. In my opinion, seeking multiple opinions from someone when making an important decision is needed because you get a diversity of choices, there are pros and cons and it can change how you look at the decision ahead of you.

You need a good diversity of options when you are making choices. Why? One time in my life, my friend was faced with a tough decision, but since he had my help to get him through the decision, it was much clearer. Also, the more people that you have helping you out with making the decision, the better chance you get of making the right choice. For example, if you ask one friend and he tells you to make the wrong choice then you think that it's the right choice, but if you have multiple friends helping to make the decision then you most likely get a better answer. Overall, the more friends you have when making a decision, the better that decision will be.

There are many pros and cons to having friends help you out when you need to make a decision. For example, if you hang out with the wrong friend group they might peer pressure you to do things that you don't want to do. Meanwhile, if you hang out with the right friends then when you have the option to do bad or illegal things then they help you stay away from it. Also, you get better opinions when you ask multiple people because of how more people have more than one opinion. Overall, making good decisions has many pros and cons to it, but here are more pros to asking for people opinions for decisions.

Finally, asking for peoples opinions can change how you think about your decisions. It is very important to listen to peoples opinions when the give them to you because they could make a small impact on your choice. This one time, I went to Florida we asked multiple people about what we should do and it really helped us have more fun that night. We were going to go to a Miami Heat basketball game, but we ended up going to a zipline and ATK tour place which was very fun. That is why it is very important to listen to peoples opinions because they can really change how your choices turn out.

It is very important to ask for peoples opinions when you need to make choices. So next time that you need help making a choice promise me that you will ask for other peoples opinions first. The next time you want to make a better choice you need to seek help from others because different choices, pros and cons and it can change how you think of your desicion.           ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

See Each human being is different from one another. But we have different experiences and some have had have the same experience.

but you wont find out until you ask you have to ask for advice and you must hope you might find the answer from someone else. They also may know other people other who know the answer and they might help .

Another opinion may help you make your choice. You may have asked but you have conflicting ideas on what you want to do. As you might have found multiple answers but you dont know what to choose you must go which is most correct. Do a Google search talk to your family but is comes the choice YOU MUST MAKE. Its on you to make the correct choice advice is made up of opinions other people give you its your job to listen to them or not.

You may be confused , scared ,negligent on the choices see advice helps you. Others help you by trying to give you there opinions about the subject at hand. See at times and you need help lets say you were hungry and you where at a gas station. And there was some nice crispy bag of chips waiting there and you where alone. Nobody to ask should i take this bag of chips next thing you know your banned for life. Because you stole a bag of chips.

In conclusion i will sum up all my points but before i do that thank you for reading my essay! Well as you see advice helps us because we ask other people who had something like the problem youve faced. And are asking about as you ask they might understand and give the answer you were looking for.

Another opinion may sway your choice onto which answer you want you also may not know what to do this may be completely new to you. And it might be confusing thats why you can speak to talk onto ask other people.            ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
7C12F166B5F3,"Everyone has stressed about making right decisions and choices. It can be be really anxious sometimes. When it comes to picking the right choices, you want to make the right one. When you ask multiple people for advice, they have most likely been through something similar to your situation. If you seek multiple opinions before making a choice, it can give you a variety of perspectives and more confidence in your decision.

Having a variety of perspectives can be beneficial when making a decision. Whether it be about what to name your dog to making new friends, all people have different opinions. In some situations, more people could be more empathetic and/or sympathetic towards your decision, while others want a straight forward answer. People experience decision making all the time, its part of life. if you making a choice, its most likely people have gone through similar decision-making situations.

As well as having multiple perspectives, you also want to be very confident in your decision. If you lack confidence then your decision may not be the right one. When people's opinions agree with your choice, it can make you more confident. With someone helping you make right choices, it gives you assurance in your decision. Having more confidence can boost your decision-making skills.

Seeking other's opinions can give you many perspectives and a boost of confidence in your choices. Having these multiple opinions can affect your decisions in choice mostly positively in your daily life. Many people may go through similar decision-making situation as you are, so when seeking for advice, always ask others because they could be going through the same decisions as you are.          ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
81BCB1DE23B7,"Millions of people ask for advice for many different things such as relationship and school. Most of the times, they ask for more than one opinion on what they're asking for. Talking to only one person can help others make decisions; however, asking more than one gives more options and is not as optimal.

Seeking for more than one opinion might seem like a drag but overall, it is the best option in certain situations to make choices. Finding more answers to a question that is being asked allows other people's viewpoints to be revealed and thought thoroughly before making the big decision. In most experiences, when people ask for relationship advice, they ask multiple people before making the correct choice; having said that, they get more opinions to be thought about. Asking more than one person lets others know what to do and not to do in the future. It allows them to learn from other's past mistakes and successions. When asking for job advice, people usually give advice on what and not to do based on their past to prepare for the upcoming future. Doing just a little more and seeking further information means taking more time out of the day, but in the end it is worth it.

Looking for only one opinion takes less time out of the day, but it is the lazier option in decision making. Asking only one person for advice means less time and thought involved in choice making. Doing this puts people at risk in taking the wrong choice and being put into a state of regret. Just one opinion does not let civilians know what to do in the future and grow as a person, they will take the hard way out in life. For example, in job interviews, just asking one person for advice means the person is put at risk in failing and is going to learn things in a more difficult fashion and is going to learn what to do based on their own experiences. Taking one piece of advice is the most minimal thing that can be done when asking for advice. Overall, it is just lazy and not worth doing.

Learning from those mistakes others have made lets human beings come together and develop as a person for the future and on. Obtaining a piece of advice from one person is useful but when given more pieces of advice, it is more optimal than when given only a small bit. When tables have turned, those who ask to give advice would be able to grow just as much or maybe even more when others are giving the most advice possible from past situations and asking more than just one person.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F949490671FA,"Whenever we feel lost or lacking in information to make a decision we often find ourselves asking questions to help understand the topic, just like many of history's famous philosophers or scientists. Such as the famous Amelia Earhart who questioned her society and its many leaders and their sexist beliefs, and the prodigy Albert Einstein who questioned his colleagues and fellow scientists about their mathematics and science theories. Both were inspired by asking themselves a question and still tried to find a better and more refined answer to support their decision and came out on top, and becoming heroes in history. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions really can help someone make a better choice by processing both sides of a topic, and receiving more information.

Seeking multiple opinions gives us two sides or more, of each topic we question. One example would be if the earth is flat or spherical in shape. Although this topic hasn't been fully debated yet. We could fully understand why both sides are so defensive by asking about their opinions. Hearing what both sides have to say can also shed light onto smaller debates that could have a bigger impact on the whole entire issue. Unfortunately, asking for other's opinions can also have some downside effects. Such as false information or too much bias to uphold that statement. Nonetheless, asking for others opinions can still help us understand their side of the topic, and quite possibly what they know that we don't.

We can also obtain more information about a topic by seeking multiple opinions. Not only do scientists and philosophers gain from more information when seeking opinions, but even the mightiest and greatest leaders of history, such as Gandhi who questioned his country and learned of an imperialistic Britain that was corrupting their way of life. When we question many others about their opinions we are given insight into what we missed or had forgotten in the past. Although, when asking others we receive a lot of things that we don't understand yet, so we tend to look it up on the internet out of curiosity and the burning questions we have. Unfortunately, even the internet can't give us all the right answers to our questions, and this will often lead us in the wrong direction.

You'll realize that the one small topic that you may have chosen out of the infinite possibilities, has given you a large amount of answers. By asking one question you came up with hundreds more, and your knowledge on the topic may have been much better than when you first started by asking that one little question. Which proves that seeking others opinions really can help you make a better choice by giving you both sides of the topic, and receiving more information.            ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
142BF0B5376A,"Opinions are the reason why we have so many different personalities.

When people share their own opinion you can see all the different thoughts they have about a certain topic.

I believe that when you have different opinions you can make a better choice.

When others share their opinions you can see what others are thinking, we can know the positive and negative impact on our decisions and opinions can help you go on the right path for the future.

When you share your opinion you can see what others are thinking. For example, during a presidential debate we know what each candidate wants for our country.

We will know how they will change our country for the better or for the worse. While watching the debate it makes it easier when we go to vote. Another example is when people share their opinion through public speaking.

Claire Wineland was a public speaker and she used her voice to impact our world for the better. If you are a public speaker than you can make a difference in this world by sharing your opinion. Sharing your opinions can benefit people and make a faster decision.

The last way you can share a opinion is by using social media. Social media plays a big roll when you make a choice.

On social media people always share their thoughts.

It can show you all the different perspectives people have about a certain topic. When you share your opinion it makes it easier when we want to choose the next president or how we feel about something.

Sharing you opinions can have a positive or negative impact when we make a decision.

My sister gives me advice all the time.

My sister gives me advice about high school because I am going next year.

She said a great thing about high school is that we get to carry our backpacks around and not use lockers, when we are going to class. Carrying our backpacks can make it easier because we have everything.

A negative impact is that our backpacks become very heavy with all of our books and binders. I can decide whether I want to carry my backpack or get my supplies from my locker between classes.

Another example is when we share opinions we can help someone feel better. Sharing your opinion can help someone feel better if nobody agrees with you.

Positive opinions can make someone make an easier choice.

The last example is when someone disagrees with you.

Opinions can have a negative impact when someone disagrees with someone else.

It is harder for the person to make a choice.

Negative opinions can be confusing. Positive and negative opinions can affect how you make a decision.

Sharing your opinions can help you go on the right path. For example, our mentors can help us choose the best college. My teachers and parents give me advice about college. They can guide you because they have been to college.

They know what is expected of you and what you have to do to graduate. Another example is when my friend, (who is in 11th grade) helps me pick my high school classes.

She makes it easier for me to make a decision because she knows how hard the classes are and how much work it is.

The classes you take in high school can affect your future and job.

The last example is when people share their opinions about life in general.

My teacher said ""we should all work hard so we can be successful.

This is important because if we don't listen to her advice then we might not get into a nice college or get an awesome job.

Advice from others impact your career and your daily life.

When you seek multiple opinions from others, you can make a better choice. When you share your opinions you can see what others are thinking. We can express our opinions through politics, public speaking and social media.

Getting advice from others can have a positive or negative impact, when we make a choice.

When we see the positive and negative side of things we know what the best decision is for us.

712A5A89778D,"In times of worry, who would most people go to for advice? Perhaps a person's first instinct would be to seek help from a friend or a close family member. While this is a good idea, it may be best to get multiple opinions on the situation. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better decisions because everyone has different experiences and ideas, and multiple opinions can help eliminate bad ideas.

Everyone grows up differently. This leads every individual to adapt different ideas and opinions. An example would be, if someone grows up in a safe and closed-off environment, he might not be as daring as someone who grew up around adventure and risk-taking. Therefore, everyone will eventually develop different ideas. Individuals will use their previous experiences to guide the advice they give. Every person has different experiences, so talking to more than one person can be a good tactic when seeking advice. If more than one person has the same idea, it may be valuable to the person in question's situation. Because everyone has different ideas and experiences, people may get a wide range of advice. While someone's first instinct may be to listen only to the person he trusts the most or is closest to, taking each opinion into consideration is the best way to maximize the possibility of the situation ending well.

While getting caught up in the moment, it's easy to develop bad ideas. People can get frustrated or caught off guard and go with the first idea that pops into their head. It's also easy to dismiss other ideas if someone thinks his first instinct is the only way to handle the problem. However, if an individual obtains more than person's opinion, and it's different from his, he's more likely to listen than if it were just one opinion. If going to people for advice, someone will automatically go to people he trusts. Realizing that he trusts them will make it easier for the person to listen to their advice. Hearing from someone that he trusts helps him understand that their idea wasn't the best option, and this will lead to a better outcome. For example, if someone was struggling with school work, his first instinct might be to procrastinate and put off the work. If he goes to his parents and/or friends and they tell him to get the work done as soon as possible, it might motivate him to finish the work instead of put it off. This is because if more than one person thinks he should get the work done, and he's the only one that thinks he should procrastinate, the feeling of being outnumbered can lead to him understanding why his idea wouldn't be effective.

When people are faced with a problem, it's a good idea to ask for more than one person's advice. Each individual's experience will lead to different advice, so receiving multiple ideas helps the final decision feel more secure. Having more than one opinion also helps get rid of ideas that won't be useful in that specific situation. It's always better to ask too much than to ask too little!",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
A2A749DEC4BE,"As a consultant that helps other students with writing, I see many strange things from people with half finished essays. The one that grabs the trophy, however, was incredibly ridiculous. At the beggining of a students work, they talked about how Abraham Lincoln and George Washington had a conversation. Not only did it have nothing to do with their central theme of Lincoln being the best president, but I gaurentee you they did not have multiple people help review their work. We did get them the help they needed, and through multiple peoples advice, it was transformed into a pretty good persuasive essay. When searching for help, whether it's with editing a school paper, or understanding concepts that are confusing for you in a difficulty subject, it's always important to look for more than one opinion. If you were to only ask a singe individual, their response could be flawed for many, many reasons. When you consult multiple people, however, the room for error decreases significantly.

For example, if you needed to write an unbiased paper on the pros and cons of making abortion legal, asking more than one person would limit the scope of the bias. If you only asked one individual, their statements could be tainted if they had a preexisting opinion on the topic. However, if you were to consult multiple people, the scope of the bias would be severely limited. The more people, the less bias you risk, so asking only one individual could end up ruining a supposedly unbiased report. Not only is bias a problem to consider when asking individuals, making sure their statements are accurate can be equally if not more important.

When asking people for advice, you must always consider whether what they're saying is actually true. Bias is incredibly important to weed out, but often fact checks can also help root out some bias too. Biased individuals are more likely to lie or include misleading statements in their advice. By discovering false or misleading statements, you can also discover hidden bias in the individual. None of us are always right, so people have mistaken opinions about many topics. When looking for help, you always run the risk of including false information from a well meaning individual, as you have nobody to fact check them against. You have no way to tell if what they're saying is true, and, if they deliver it more confidently, you may already be convinced it's a fact. Luckily, when you ask multiple people, and fact check all of their statements against one another, you can assure yourself a significantly smaller chance of obtaining false information. Although fact checking against other people can certainly help, there are other ways, including searching on Google or looking it up with a textbook, to fact check correctly. However, some statements are simply opinions and cannot be fact checked, only compared to other people's opinions.

When attempting to rephrase a sentence that sounds strange or incorrect, or when trying to add more detail and glamour to an otherwise boring sentence, there is no right or wrong answer. Certain techniques may work better or worse, but there is never a fix all type solution. So when taking advice from someone who, for example, is helping you edit your paper, some things they say you cannot fact check with Google or a textbook. If you were to only consult this individual, they would have full control, and may make suggestions that aren't the best for your paper. That's why, especially when dealing with highly opinionated topics like rephrasing sentences and adding additional detail, its crucial to consult multiple people and make sure most agree with your changes to ensure they're the best for your paper. Oftentimes in a writing help after school club I'm a part of, we have to deal with problems like these where students need more detail, but there's really no right and wrong way to phrase the sentence. That's why we consult each other to make sure every change we make is for the good of that persons writing.

Wednesdays, after school, I work as a consultant to the writing center. In the club, younger students, usually from seventh grade, come to get help with their writing from older, more experienced students. Many times, seventh graders come in with half finished essays that could barely be considered rough drafts, but as it turns out they've already turned them in and need to re-write them for a higher grade. The process can be difficult, and sometimes grueling if the seventh grader doesn't want to and cooperate, but I still love consulting. Working there is a joy, but one of the things that really makes us able to go above and beyond to help other students is the ability to cross check with other consultants and work together. Often, seventh graders are assigned only one consultant to help them with their work. However, like I've said above, one persons opinion can definitely be flawed. This is why we employ many talented consultants, so if one doesn't know what to do or accidentally makes a mistake, others can catch it and further assist them.

Asking multiple people for advice, no mater the topic, is always an important and crucial step of the writing process. By asking multiple people, you assure the least bias possible, the highest form of fact checking, the best way to phrase sentences and other similar opinionated subjects, and you ensure none of those you seek advice from made mistakes. ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
C555B9B02440,"""When people ask for advice, they will most likely ask multiple people"". The reason people seek for advice from multiple people is because seeking advice from one person is way too easy and by now some people have figured out that god laughs at us when we try something thats too easy and says, ""Hahaha you really thought you could do that, thats to easy your gonna have to do more if you want to do that!"" I'm getting off topic. The reason people ask more than one person for advice is because like I said its too easy so asking more than one person you can have different opinions but eventually you will get they same answer more often then you have what you should do, just don't ask old people or they will give you a story and it will be long and boring. There you go a essay telling you how asking for help from multiple people, can give you multiple opinions and which ever one you get you get more of the same answer and you us that one because it seemed to have worked on other people or there just lying to you and saying ""finally that kids gone"".

But as I was saying, ask multiple people for help, not just one. Asking one is just plain stupid, but asking multiple will give you multiple reasons why you should go with that answer. Think of it like this, if you ask multiple people for help with idk ask out your crush, most of them tell you to be casual and to not get nervous, so what are you going to choose, the one that you got most of the same answer.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2

First of all, making good choices are very important in life, you don't want to make bad decisions that come with bad consequences right? So making good decisions can help you in the future. Say you robbed a store because you're poor and don't have enough money, you get caught and the police arrest you. That's going to stay on your criminal record for basically the rest of your life. With that on your criminal record applying for jobs would be a lot harder since they don't criminals working with a bunch of innocent people. Not just jobs but applying for colleges would be even harder to get into. College is very important but getting the money for it is a struggle too. People who give out scholarships are looking for students who have good grades, no criminal activities and are overall good at school. So making good decisions is the way to go because it makes everything a lot easier and if you're also nice to everyone they would want to be around you more!

Getting opinions from other people are important, especially with something thats permanent. Let's just say that you are fresh out of college and have some spare money and you get this really cool idea on what to spend it on.

You want a tattoo. You ask your friends if you should get one that has a meaning to it and most of them say yes! The tattoo you will be getting is in memory of your dog that had passed away a few months ago. The idea of the tattoo is going to be a paw print but with a little twist. Instead of the regular bottom of a dogs paw you wanted it to be hearts. This means that any choice in your life can effect how it goes!

Asking some of your friends and family members for opinions would be good because they would always be honest to you, unless they're really mean and don't care how you feel, but thats unlikely to happen so you're okay! When you're a teenager you tend to buy stupid stuff, like putty, slime, a Star Wars Lightsaber, basically stuff you really don't need. If you really want to buy something but aren't sure if you really want it or not I recommend that you ask your parents because they're always trying to do their best and they want whats best for you so good ahead and ask them! This explains to think before you do! But in this case Ask for opinions then do!

In the end, everything matters in life especially your safety so don't go around and make bad decisions that effect you in the future! And if you go back to the orthodontist story in the beginning, what would've happened if you didn't get those recommendations? Would you have lost some teeth? Would you be in pain? who knows! The only thing I know is that it woud've been a lot of money! ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
437E9376FB71,"Nobody is perfect. Making better decisions is something that all people can strive for. It is important that you ask for other people's opinions when you need help making a decision. The average person would say that they would take back a decision or choice they made in the past or would want to change something. The choices we make each day affect our lives going forward and for our own sake, we need to make better choices. Getting advice from multiple people can help you to avoid personal bias, see from new perspectives, and get help from qualified people.

When being tasked to make an important decision, it is important that you avoid personal bias and take other people's ideas and thoughts into account. People with biased minds often already have a decision in mind before making a decision and usually will not change their mind. In order to avoid bias and make the right choice, you have to think about all the outcomes to all decisions and ponder each one. For example, when betting on a sports team to win a game, you must think about how realistic your preferred outcome is. People who are fans of one team often bet that they will win even though that possibility is highly unlikely. Everybody has a personal bias and it is matter of controlling it. Seeking other people's opinions can help you to be unbiased and make the right decision, rather than making the more personally favorable one. Finally, allowing your mind to be clouded and biased will not help you make a better choice.

Asking for advice or opinions from others can help you see from a new perspective. When viewing a decision from others opinions, you may learn new information and realize things that you had not before. When I make a decision, I ask my parents, siblings, and friends for advice because I want to see what type of lens they are viewing my decision from. Depending on what they may say, my thoughts, ideas, and choice may all change. Seeing from other people's view may spark your imagination to think of a new choice or to understand that a certain choice is bad. Not trying to see from another point of view or believe that your choice is wrong is like having tunnel vision, one dimensional and myopic. Being able to see from multiple different perspectives can help you to make the best choice because it is not always your own or your best friend's perspective that is the best.

Getting advice from other people can help when making a decision because they may be more knowledgeable or experienced on a topic. It is important to listen to these people because they have a better understanding on the possible outcomes, pros, and cons. Conversely, you should take the advice of someone who is less knowledgeable or is less experienced on a topic into account less. For example, asking your friend who has a bad grade in science class for help on homework is not a good idea. Asking your parents, siblings, or a friend that is very good at science is a better choice. Next, people who are more experienced and have made the right or wrong decision in the past are also people that can help you make better choices because they can tell you first-hand what to do in certain scenarios. When needing to know whether you should take a class over the summer or not, asking someone who has already been in the class will have a better understanding on if you should or should not than yourself or someone who has not taken the class. The advice of more qualified people should be searched for when trying to make the best choice.

Each day you make hundreds of choices and each choice you make effects more than just yourself. They effect your parents, siblings, peers, etc. It is important that we all try to make the best choice possible each day. Asking others for their thoughts, opinions, and advice on what you should do is critical. You must avoid your personal bias when making choices, try to see things from a new perspective and take in the wisdom of someone who is more knowledgeable and experienced than you into account. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
C5BAE31EFC62,"Are two heads actually better than one? Why might people seeking advice ask more than one person?

I think some people ask more than one person because, different people have different education, people differ from each other and it's important to see different viewpoints.

One reason why people might seek different opinions is because different people have different education.

Some people could've been taught different things or just know different knowledge in general.

There could be people who could have the perfect advice for you but then there could be someone who just doesn't know what to say.

People are taught different things everyday and asking more people might get you better advice.

Asking more than one person about advice is also important because people are different.

People are evolving and are just so much diverse from one another.

People are from different cultures, races, are different genders and more.

Asking different people for advice would get you a lot of different answers just because people are way more advanced and different then they were before.

My Final reason to explain why people seek different opinions is because it's important to see different viewpoints.

It's important to see different viewpoints because then you can have many different options.

Different options give you more to think about, and just more advice.

In Conclusion,

People seek different opinions because different people have different education, people are just different and it gives you more viewpoints.

Different opinions allow for the brain to think more and see which solution the best.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
63FEC53AF437,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Sometimes people ask for advice from other people to get their opinions, for example it helps find your decision, how to execute your decision, and to know what to do afterwords. It is good to get other peoples opinions so do not be scared to ask.

The first thing getting other peoples opinions helps with is finding your decision. It helps finding your decision by finding what you agree with. Finding out what your going to do is the most important thing to do. When someone asks you for advice don't give them bad advice, because the situation could be very important.

The second thing getting advice from more than one person helps with is figuring out how your going to execute your decision. This is somewhat important depending on the situation. When going through with the decision if it could hurt the person let them down easy. When figuring out how to deal with the problem go with what you feel is right not just what other people say.

The third and final thing on my list is finding out what to do afterwords. This isn't as important as the other two things. Depending of if the situation is family or friends changes the level of importance. When you execute the choice don't get depressed and turn to drugs or alcohol turn to your friends who always have your back.

sometimes it's good to talk to other people for advice not just one person. people ask for advice from multiple people to help find their decision, how to execute the choice, and to know what to do afterwords. people who are sensitive need better advice than others and a shoulder to lean on after they do it. this was my opinion on what the subject was on.

Some people probable havent because they dont think they need it,they want their own opinion,and they dont like getting others opinions. Seeking multiple opinions can help make a better choice because they might have good reason,you have more to think about,and it can get you out of trouble.

Other people might have good reasons. When someone has an opinion they usually have a reason why. Their opinion might have better reasons than yours. Their opinion makes more sense. Its better to go with an opinion that makes more sense because yours might not. Its an easier option. Good reasons are an easier way to go than bad reasons. Good reasoning can help you out because it an easier option,it makes more sense,and it might be better than yours.

It gives you more to think about. Maybe someones else's opinion is different from yours. You can compare them and see the different reasons why. People usually think before they act.

If someone wanted to do something reckless without thinking someones idea might change that. After thinking about it you wont do something reckless. You need to think about things and having more options helps with that, Thinking before doing something is helpful because it stops you from doing something reckless, and it might change your option.

It can get you out of trouble. Maybe you were thinking of doing something bad. Someone else's opinion is gonna remind you about the consequences. It makes you more aware, Maybe you didnt know what could happen if you did something bad without an opinion. Maybe you dont have an opinion. Someone else's opinion is helpful because if you dont have one then there isn't much for you to think about. You should want to stay out of trouble and opinions help with that because it makes you more aware,you get reminded pf consequences, and you think more.

0DEAB57A504B,"I know that I always ask other people for advice on things. However, I always ask more than one person for this advice. Advice given by other people is often very useful, but needs validation. People can lie very easily, and if you only ask one person, these lies can seep into your brain like water into a crack. Therefore, it is best to ask more than one person on advice. You should always ask more than one person for advice because you can see how people react to your ideas, it can provide information on how other people think about certain topics and can challenge your thoughts.

First off, it can help you see how others react to your ideas. This is quite important because if you need this advice to make a speech, it can give you an insight on how your audience will act towards the sliver of knowledge you are sharing. The reasoning behind this is that having more than one person validate can show you how multiple people can respond to a certain topic. If you know how multiple people will act, you will see how an audience could do the same. It also helps you realize if this thought is a good or bad thought. People will tell you if they think that your thought is horrible or not. This can help you mold it to perfection.

Next, it can provide information on other people's thoughts on your topic. If people dont want to hear your ideas, why will an audience? This critical point of review will show you if people will react positively or negatively. If they are more willing to hear it, than an audience might want to hear it too. It can also show if people have certain foundations of knowledge on a subject. If they try to propose changes, this shows they are interested in the subject, and that most other people will be too.

Lastly, it can help you challenge your ideas. Asking multiple people can open your eyes to how others will want to add to your topic. This can be in the form of adding things to it, revising it, or even changing your thoughts entirely. If other people want to add things to your idea, than an audience will want to as well. This can show you how a mass of people will want to challenge your thoughts. They can ask questions demanding that you answer concerns over your idea. This can even strengthen your perception on a topic, or it could make your change your stance.

In conclusion, you should ask multiple people for advice because it can help you observe how others will react, let the thoughts of others be incorporated into your ideas, and provide an insight on the concerns of others against you. Advice is always useful, and you need to see others for advice. Without other people, you won't succeed. In fact, go ask somebody else for advice and challenge yourself to seek more sources on that piece of advice. Lots of people, including myself, ask other people for an insight on a particular topic. We all ask for advice, and we should always ask more people about the given advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Why do people ask for advice? People ask for advice, so they would be able to figure out an issue they are having, when asking for adivce they are able to figure out more. Us as humans rely on eachother for help for support, people forget that there are people to help them that they are not alone. Advice can help somebody make a good desion, or help resolve an issue.

84187E561424,"When your stuck with a decision to make, you might not know what to do. You would normally ask someone for their opinion or maybe multiple people. Sometimes you may wonder if it's actually important to ask for someones opinion or just go with your own. And then you get stuck on that idea and you may end up making a wrong choice and later regret it. Today, I will be explaining why it's important to ask for other peoples advice.

It's important to ask for someones advice is because you want to see what that person would choose. You want to always see what he/she would want to choose instead of the other things to get a point of view of what they think would be best. For example, you ask a friend if they would rather choose American Eagle or Hollister to shop at. Your friend would go with what they think is the better option and could also explain why. Then you could ask other people the same thing and everyone would choose what they like best and you would come up with your own opinion based on some things other people told you.

Another reason why its important is because it could be beneficial. When you grow up there will be many hard choices to make. One of them is choosing the right job for you. There might come a time where you like one job but you could also end up liking another one. Thats where other peoples advice come to play. They would say they like job or this job and state reasons why. Then what you could do is get the job with the most support and base your choice off of that one.

One more reason why it's important to ask for other peoples opinion is because they could become useful in life. Lets say you want to get start smoking ciggerates and your unsure if you should or not. Some friends say you should and others say you shouldnt. Then you postpone the idea of doing it for a while but then you end up forgetting about it. Then suddenly you could remember the thought of getting one and research things about the dangers of smoking and finally realize it sure was a good idea forgetting about it since it could be harmful to your lungs.

It's important to ask for other peoples opinions and ask for advice. They could be useful later in life, beneficial in many ways, and you could see what other people would choose. Opinions are really useful and also advice because you don't know when you're going to need it. It's important to ask for opinions just to make sure you are making the right choice.

4A292725EE82,"Getting advice from multiple people can be unnecessary or vital depending on how severe the issue is, and not a lot of people see the part where it's important to get advice from several different people. Many people just think that they should get advice from one person, or even just get advice from himself/herself. But both of those solutions to needing advice can be incorrect if the problem is big enough. Sometimes, you need to have multiple people to help solve the puzzle. The reasons to that logic is simple, there are opportunities to get help in other ways, different solutions, and a chance to ask someone who has experience with the problem for advice.

Sometimes, someone cannot even solve a problem with the advice of others, which means that they could also ask for help from others. This can come in a few forms, depending on what the problem is and what is needed. It can be hands-on help with the issue, guidance to another person that can help more, or even as simple as some encouraging words, any of those can help solve a problem. For example, person one goes to person two and says, ""Can you give me some advice on how to fix a flat tire on my car?"" Then person two gives some advice. Person one asks for help with it because he/she didnt'd understand, person two declines. Person one goes to person three and asks the same questions, person 3 gives different advice, but person one still doesn't understand, so they go to person four, and person four offers to help person one. Person one and person four fix the flat tire, and that couldn't have been achieved if person one had just given up when he/she didn't understand person two's advice. Basically, getting advice from multiple can lead to someone just offering help.

Different solutions are, of course, inevitable, considering that different people have different experience and opinions on anything and everything. If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.

So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, ""Person two, who are you voting for?"" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works.

Finally, the chance that one of the people that you ask has experience with the problem. This is beneficial because, of course, past experience with the problem can lead to better advice than advice from someone that has never faced the problem. For example, person one, once again, is having trouble with the cursed car, so person one goes to person two, person three, person four, person five, person six, and person seven. Person two, person three, and person five all give some advice that they found on the internet, person four offers to help but really doesn't know what he/she is doing. Person six just shrugs and says, ""I don't know what to do."" But person seven was a car mechanic for a few years, and person one didn't know that. So person seven not only gives advice that helps fix the car's current problem, he/she also fixes it to the point where it doesn't break down twice every week. The point is, if you go to multiple people for advice, chances are, you'll find someone with hands-on experience that can help you with the problem.

The main reason to explaining all of this is to get to this one point, that seeking advice from multiple people can be extremely useful for a multitude of problems. From fixing a car that can't seem to stay fixed to not knowing who to vote for, multiple people giving advice can help a lot. The President of the United States has the cabinet, which is a group of people dedicated to giving the president advice. So, if there's a big problem that needs to get solved and the advice of one person isn't working, try one more person, and if that doesn't work, one more, if that doesn't work, keep going until it does, because there's a high chance that someone can help with whatever the problem is, even if it isn't your inner circle of friends or colleagues, the advice that you need could be close by and you could never even realize it, it could be at multiple points nearby, and you could never even know that several people is what you're looking for. Sometimes, if there's a puzzle with missing pieces, you need to ask multiple people to help solve the puzzle, because they could have the missing pieces in their pockets.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
15398FCF1379,"How can someone make a better choice by hearing multiple people's opinions? Receiving multiple opinions can increase the chances of making a good and responsible choice. If someone were to ask only one person for advice, they may not choose the most responsible choice. When someone hears multiple responses, they'll most likely choose the response they hear most. Hearing advice from multiple people helps make a responsible decision and helps people who are unsure and worried about making making a bad choice.

Seeking advice from multiple people creates a responsible decision. If someone were to ask for just one persons opinion, they could make the wrong choice. The first person may not be the most responsible and don't think about the negative outcomes of making that decision. They just want to make a choice even if it's reckless. Hearing from more than one voice will give someone more options and then they can see what decision most of the people chose. However, if multiple people were choosing a bad decision, it could plant the wrong idea into someone's mind still leading to a bad choice. For example, if someone already had an idea in their head and they go to ask a few people for advice, multiple people could tell them to make the wrong choice and change the persons mindset completely. This is why it's necessary to ask people that are responsible, more specifically adults that are able to make more responsible decisions. Adult or not, it is important to ask for more than one persons opinion if you are seeking advice.

Hearing more than one opinion is super beneficial to someone who is completely stuck and unsure if they are going to make the right choice. If someone didn't have any idea on what decision to make, hearing the same response from multiple people helps a ton. It also is super beneficial when someone may think they know what choice they want to make, but hearing it from other people may reassure them or make them change their mind to make a good choice. As an example, someone may think they're about to make a good choice when in reality, they're not. The person may ask people if it's a good decision and the majority of opinions may change that persons mind.

Seeking advice to make the right choice from many people helps make a good decision even if the person may be set on one choice. As long as responsible people are being asked, a good decision is sure to be made.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

getting information from multiple outlets is important because everyone sees different things happening. In the news people tend to stick to one station of viewpoint, but this isn't always the best because it is usually going through multiple people to make it sound better or worse, for example; you may see a headline that says ""

Donald Trump wastes tax money to ruthlessly crush immigrants dreams

"" and you may see another headline from the same event reading ""

Donald Trumps wall was triumphant in protecting America from foreign criminals

"". the reason these sound so different is because they are coming from different points of view, the first one probably got its information from an immigrant, the second probably got its information from someone who likes the wall. Both of these are true and if you get facts from both of them together you can get a better understanding on what really happened.

Now, lets get back to when people ask for advice, because asking for advice and reading news are too completely different things, however you can use a lot of the same techniques. However its often a lot harder with advice because you dont have sources and they aren't always both about the same event, instead they are straight up the persons opinion. You also can't merge advice as easily as you can with news for example: you are asking your friends if you should cheat on the math test, the first friend says ""no, thats dishonest"" and the other friend says ""do it or you might have to take summer school"" dont just merge them and half cheat on the test, instead you should weigh in the positives and negatives. weighing the pros and cons works great for getting advice and once you do this you can make an educated decision.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

Almost everyone does this to be sure because when you get something wrong everything goes downhill from there. Lots of people get stressed when their answering something that is hard of them or hard to decide, so they usually depend on other people to help them. When asking only one person for advise, it will most likely lead you to the wrong answer so most people stick to asking more then one person and then when you have all the opinions you can pick the one said the most out of everyone. Asking more then one person will make you feel better and more sure about your answer.

2B605EED5E4E,"Can asking for advice boost people's knowledge about a situation? People want to make good choices to situations, and not regret it. Sometimes, not everyone makes the best choices to their problems. When people do not know a way to help their situation, people do not make the right choices to their situations. Which is why people ask for different opinions, from different people to help the problem. It can help boost their knowledge on various situations, and make better life choices. Asking advice from multiple people can help people's problem, and get different points of views.

One way seeking multiple opinions from people can help is by solving people's problem. Not all people can solve their own problems without seeking help from other people. Since situations can be complicated, people can hit a road block by not knowing how to solve their own problems. For example, it can be a life choice on picking what job to pursue later in life, or it can be a family situation. Sometimes other people have dealt with the same situation, and know how it feels to be in it. Some people might be experts to a situation, or know the best way to solving a problem. Getting people's opinion to make a better choice can help people, for further instances from happening, and can help with having an idea to make a non-regrettable, better choice. To summarize, having multiple opinions from others can help solve a problem to make a great choice.

Another way seeking multiple opinions from other people can help make better choices is by getting different points of views. Everyone has their own views on different situations, or topic based on people's past experiences. When people do use an opinion that has been suggested, it sheds a new light to a view people do not think of. The different way can probably benefit people with making the greater choice, and can be faster, or a more efficient way towards a better decision in a problem. Also, seeing another opinion on an situation to make a better decision can help see what could happen. Specifically, if people want to compare one opinion from another to see if one might be more beneficial than the others. People's different points of views on a problem can help next time when people come across the same, or similar situation to help make a more great choice. To conclude, having multiple opinions from others can help make a better choice by having different views from different people.

All in all, asking for advice from multiple people to make better decisions can help benefit people's problem, and get different points of views. By helping others with people's different opinions, it can help make a more great choice than without getting help from other people. Having a choice someone has made without seeking advice from others might not be the best choice because people would not have known what else to have done in the situation, or it would be a choice people would regret. After having people's points of views, people might see another side to solving a problem to making a better decision. Maybe one day not having a chance to getting opinions to a situation will be the last time people will come across the problem. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5EB9ECE0BE68,"Getting advice from two or more people can change the way you look at so many things! Asking many people for advice can help someone make the right choice. For one, asking multiple people can give you different perspectives about it. Secondly, some advice can be really bad so you'll need to seek for more that will give you success. Lastly, It's better to look for more options when trying to make the right choice. All in all, asking more than one person can lead to a big success.

First of all, making the right choices comes in many different ways. Getting more than one point of view is going to allow you to see what other people think. Seeing how other people think might change you. Everyone has different views on everything, so asking three people gives you three different answers. Making the right choice is hard, but if you get different perspectives things will get easier.

Secondly, some people might not give you great advice. Everyone's advice is different because everyone's different. Not all advice is going to be the same or perfect. Going out and only asking one person for advice isn't a great idea and this is why. One person, is a piece of advice and it could be bad or good, but if you ask more than one person you have multiple to choose from.

Lastly, searching for more options is always the right choice. Having only one option can hurt you. If you had only one option for everything in the world we'd all be dead. Having more than one option can lead you to bigger and better things such as, being a hero, making the right choices, helping people out, and finally saving lives.

9529DEA237B1,"Have you ever had to ask multiple people for advice? When you are wanting help for advice to make a choice, asking more than one person for their opinions, will help influence you to make the right choice. When it comes to to making that decision, asking multiple people it gives you a better chance to narrow down your options, and helps make you focus on the selfless way to look at your choices.

Once you ask multiple people for their advice then there will be less stress on your shoulders. When you do others will be telling your their opinions, and their way at looking at your options. When looking at your options from a different stand point you will be able to think using a different mind set, so you can figure out the best options and know what not to choose. Once you've narrowed down your options you can continue to look at your choices in many different view points until you have found the best option.

When asking more than one person, their minds will not be thinking or the more selfish options since the choices will not benefit them in anyway. Since it will not be benefiting them their thoughts won't be influenced by the selfish options that if they were in that position they would choose. So for them to have selfless thoughts your choices should not benefit them in anyway. So once you ask the right person their minds will not tend to think on a selfish level and will be trying to makes the better choice for the greater good. Instead of when you would've been making the choice, your mind would tell itself this benefits me more so in the end that would most likely be your final decision.

While asking multiple people you will most likely pick the choice with the majority votes. So when you ask your friends if your shirt matches or not, say three out of four say it matches and looks good. You will mostly continue to wear that shirt, since the majority likes it. Since you asked multiple people about your shirt you can wear it knowing it matches, instead of second guessing yourself. So when asking more than one person about a decision, you can find out what the majority likes so making your decision will be done for you making it easier for yourself.

Now when you a faced with a decision will you start asking multiple people for their opinions so you know the best option? If you do not you might end up making a selfish decision, that could make others upset. So keep in mind you should always ask for help on making a decision. Having other opinions in mind gives you a better thought process, so you will end up having different stand points which can help you make to better decision in the end.                                                                                                                                                                                ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

C67DED3264EC,"Almost everyone in the world has once in their life asked for advice. Asking for advice is something we all do, but asking more people for advice can acually help you more than just asking one person. Asking from a variety of people can help you make the best decision possible. People that are close to you can help you in your decision making process. Talking to more than one person is importent because it limits a person's bias, will give you a reason to support your choice, and having diverse advice often leads to new solutions to the decision you are faced with.

Everyone on Earth has biases no matter your income, gender, or age. The reason we all have biases is because each one of us lived a life different from anyone else. Just like snowflakes no two humans are the same. For this reason when you ask someone for advice the answer will reflect their experianceses and their life. For example, if you are unsure if you should travel to Greece and you ask someone who had a bad experiance over there or does not like to travel, then that person will very likely say that you should not go. But on the other hand if someone lived in Greece they would most likely say that you should travel and it is a nice place to see. If you would not have asked the second person your impression would have been due to the first person who was unfortunate to have a bad experiance, so you may have missed an oppurtunity to vist the place. When you ask more people for advice you will get more facts and will make your perspective grow and help you make a better choice.

A good reason to ask advice from more than one person is for you to get all the possible options that are presented to you. When one person gives advice they may not think of a reason why it would be a bad choice untill you talk to more people. Instead, if you ask more people each person will widen your view on things and tell you more choices to your decisions. Once you have talked to other people you will have an easier time to make your decision because you got different kinds of views and the pros/cons for the different choices that are optional.

Asking for advice not just from one person can be really benaficial to you. The reason is that each person has a different point of view, so if you as the person asking for advice get a response that you have not thought of already, it can make you start to think of better solutions to your decision. For example, scientists when they are trying to figure out a solution for a problem are not going to just ask one expert for an answer, but they will ask multiple other scientists for thier ideas and knowledge to come up with the best solution. Asking different sources can help you come up new solutions/choices to the decision and can lead you into a new way of thinking.

Hard decisions are not easy to deside on. Asking for advice is sometimes necassory for people to think through their choices with other people. Asking more than one person not only helps you think through the choices at hand, but also opens your perspective and makes you come up with creative out of the box ideas. It helps with making day to day decisions and big problems in life. Asking for advice from different people will help your life and help you make better decisions/choices.    ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Also you can ask for advice when you need help or you don't know how to do something. Also asking muliple people for advice can help people make a better choice becauce other people might have diffrent advice or diffrent expereances with thething the person is asking them.

The first person you ask for advice might be diffrent from the second person you ask or it might be better advice.

Look if you need advice you need advice but you gotta make sure you talk to more than one person because one person could give you terrible advice and mess everything up. When you need advice go to someone older than you that you trust it could be a teacher a parent or a student in a higher grade. You can ask your friend but they might have not lived through what your asking them and they give you advice and it be so wrong but you asked them because you trust them. When you need advice the first people you wanna go to is your parents and if you do not feel comfortable asking them for advice ask a teacher or ask a administrator. You always want more than one persons advice even if it is your friend you need to have more than one person. All I am saying is that do not just have one person give you advice. It is good to talk to more than one person for advice because, some one could have a different opinion, someone else's advice could help you,and they could have been through the same thing.

Someone you talk to could have a different opinion then the other person you talk to. Let's say you talked to best friend for advice and they gave you some,but you talk to someone else and they say something different then you dont know whose advice to take. When I want advice I go to the most trusting person I know which is my parents or teachers because they were are age to. If i need advice I think is what I am doing important or is it stupid cause if it is stupid there is no point in asking for advice but if it is important ask someone you trust. So when you ask for advice do not just go straight to your best friend go to someone that you trust and that might have been through it. All I am saying is there are other people you trust with opinion's.

Next, someones advice could help you, see if you go to one person they could give you advice but the advice could be bad. If you go to more than one person for advice one of the people you talk to could actually help you in the end. Let's say that you came to me and ask for my advice on this guy and I gave you bad advice in the end it could all backfire but if you came to me and another person the other persons advice could be better than mine. So if you went to some one that you did not know and you asked them for advice but they do not like you so they gave you bad advice and you listen to the advice and you did what they told you to at the end it could end horrible but if you go to people you trust they can give you better advice than the person that you do not know. When you need advice go to people you trust not one person a couple of people. In the end everybody's opinion matters.

Also, if you need advice the people giving it to you could have been through it. so I had a friend and they were struggling with school and they came to me and told me so I gave them advice and I told them go to there other friend and ask them. So the next day she came to me and told me there advice was bad but mine was not and I said because I have been through the same struggle but all you gotta do is ask other people because the first person you asked might have not been through it. Really all you need to do when you need advice is have more than one person giving you advice. You mainly wanna go to a teacher or a peer that is older because they have gone through the same problems in life and they got through it. I believe that if you need more than one pair of shoes you need more than one opinion.

In conclusion, it is good to have more than one person giving you advice because some one could have a different opinion, some one else's advice could help you , and they could have been through the same thing. You will need advice in you life but you will always wanna go to the same person;also you do not always have to have more than one person but it is better to have more than one person. Really all I am trying to tell you here is that you wanna have more than one person's opinion. You will always need advice on something but normally you only wanna ask one person well it is better to get multiple opinions than one. At the end one of those people's opinion will come in handy.

Just think about it when your about to ask one person for advice maybe I do need to have other people's opinions.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
2F1FD58DEA2F,"You are walking through all the different houses. There are so many to pick, and you have to choose the right one for the right price. This house looks aesthetic, but this one's cheaper. This one has a bigger backyard, but this one is in a better community. There are too many ways where you could go wrong. You end up calling up your friends to help you look through the options. You've all been there before, whether it was making decisions as big as buying the right house or as small as what restaurant to eat at. In order to get the good advice you need, you should ask more than one person. By asking multiple people, you will have more options on what to do, different views and opinions on the situation, and less stress about the decision.

One reason you should talk to more than one person is to get many options as for what do. While one solution may not work very well, another may be the best one for you. Asking more people also increases the chances of finding someone who had to make the same decision or was in the same situation. This would be incredibly helpful because they could give advice on what they chose to do and the result. For example, when I was working on a difficult math problem, I asked many people for their ideas on how to approach it. Though some of them could not solve the problem or help me, others came up with brilliant solutions. One of them had seen a similar problem before, so he pointed me in the right direction. By asking more than one person for advice, I received many choices from which I could pick the best one. However, sometimes choices are not enough, and we need to understand the options better.

Everyone can view an issue differently depending on personal experience or background knowledge. By asking more than one person for their input, you can understand the whole decision better. Understanding the positives and negatives of each side would greatly assist us with making a better choice. I applied this in real life by asking my friends for help when I was trying to decide on what to spend my money on. They explained to me the reasons they would buy or not buy each item. Because of them, I responsibly used my money on something that would benefit my studies and was worth the price I paid for. By weighing the pros and cons of each option, you can more easily make the best decisions for you. Asking many different people for their opinion will help you understand the full picture. However, sometimes these decisions can be extremely overwhelming.

Decisions can be very stressful because of all the options. However, when others also understand your situation, it is a lot less of a weight to carry. Talking to more than one person can help relieve the stress a lot more than if it is carried by only one or two people. For instance, I was very stressed about an upcoming competition and I could not focus on studying. I explained my situation to many of my friends and they helped me calm down and gave me advice on how to focus and study. Getting advice from many people helped me relieve my stress and do well at the competition. I felt more calm because of the support from my friends after getting advice. Making sure you are not stressed is very important because it could affect your studies and relationship with friends and family. By asking more than one person for advice, you will most likely be less stressed.

Listening to multiple options, knowing the pros and cons of each side, and relieving decision-making stress are all reasons why you should ask more than one person for advice. You always want to make the right choice, especially for bigger decisions like buying a house. Getting to know all your options and the pros and cons of each is very important for making the best choice for you. However, this could be very stressful and asking all your friends for advice will make sure you feel supported and less stressed. Next time you have to make a decision, don't forget to ask more than one person for advice! ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0

This can help you get a broader idea of what you should do.

Talking to a variety of people for advice on a choice can give you multiple opinions on what your trying to decide. Let's say you're at a car sale and you don't know which car to buy. Asking different people for their advice might open up new options on what car you could buy. They might suggest a different car dealer or a different car that wasn't sold at the sale. Because you asked different people, your decision was open ended.

Asking for someone's advice can help you make a choice that your struggling to make. Furthermore, different people have different brains.

AFF882607973,"Have you ever asked your friends for advice on an issue or to help solve a problem? If so, did you take that advice, or throw it to the wind without ever looking back? I believe that seeking multiple opinions allows for better decisions to be made. Asking for multiple opinions on a subject is efficient because it allows us to view an issue from multiple angles, allows for a more unbiased response, and hearing several opinions can change our thinking on a certain subject for the better.

First, asking for multiple opinions on a topic allows us to view an issue from all sides, rather than just our own. Hearing several sides of a story or particular topic, can often have an affect on our decisions. Say you and a friend get involved in an argument and you aren't sure how to handle it. You ask some friends what to do. They explain that your friend is having a bad day and some family issues at home. Rather than be upset with your friend, you decide to do everything in your power to help your friend out. Hearing other angles or sides of a story changes the way we view an issue or person, therefore plays a key role in the making of that decision or series of decisions.

Secondly, seeking advice from several people allows for a more unbiased response. For example, say a woman and her boyfriend have a disagreement. Asking her boyfriends best friend may not be such a great idea, seeing as he could be biased on the subject. Asking a group of neutral friends would prove most effective, therefore less biased. In more cases than none, one particular person may favor one side more than another, where as multiple people could appeal to both sides.

Lastly, receiving advice from several people can change our thinking on a topic for the better. An example would be, a friend of yours pulls a ruthless prank on you. Instead of laughing along with your friend, you become upset and infuriated. You make a split second decision to retaliate. Several people encourage you to inform your friend that their actions bothered you, rather than getting even. Hearing the same thing from several people can often affect the way we view a topic. Rather than repeating those infuriating actions towards your friend, you explain to that individual that you were offended and deeply upset by their prank. When we decide in our minds that something negative is a good idea, or our only option, hearing differently from multiple people with our best interest at heart becomes a deciding factor in the choices we make daily.

To sum it all up, asking multiple people for advice is more efficient that asking only one. Hearing several opinions allows for neutral, unbiased advice. Receiving advice from several friends, teachers, peers, or family members can play a rather important role on our thought process on a given topic in a positive way. And viewing all sides of a story, instead of just our own, can allow for better, more beneficial choices to be made.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
7581E5970FE9,"When someone has to make a decision, would they choose to ask one person or many people for different opinions? They choose to interview different types of people as it helps to make an intellectual choice. By asking a variety of people for wisdom, one collects different viewpoints and utilizes their mind to make the best decision.

To begin with, having multiple ideas from others gives an understanding of what choice someone would have to make. Therefore, it is important to ask a vast group of people for their knowledge. For example, say that a female has to make the decision of whether or not to vote in the upcoming general election. She decides to ask for the judgments of her friends and family. The lady will then attain wisdom on the subject from both groups. The viewpoints she receives will impact her decision of choosing to vote or not. Secondly, by asking a single person for advice, one would have to trust they are talking to the right person. Many people invoke their judgments to influence others. Interviewing one person wouldn't allow multiple sources in which one can make a proper choice. The interviewee may or may not give a beneficial judgment to the interviewer. In contrast, multiple viewpoints contains different aspects of the decision. Thirdly, reaching out to a variety of sources gives one the experience of others. Humans carry a huge amount of wisdom inside of their brains. Many use their previous opportunities as a way to impact others. Hearing about different events that happened to others will impact the decision-making; anyone would appreciate to listen to the path taken by multiple people. All in all, having a vast group of opinions will educate a person to make their choice wisely.

Then, by receiving validated judgments, one uses their brain in the final process of making their decision. Firstly, intelligence and opinions balance each other to make the best choice possible. No one in the right state of mind would blindly make a decision without conducting research. For example, currently the world is involved in the massive coronavirus outbreak. As a result, airlines have canceled many flights and dropped prices for airline fares. People have taken interest into visiting the infected places but they realize that they could be at risk for attracting the virus and possibly dying. By using their brains and judgments from others, the proper choice would be to not travel to the contaminated places. Next, receiving useful information will impact your decision. Whether it's one tiny detail or a statistic that can't be overlooked, it's bound to take affect on your judgment. For instance, a junior in high school is deciding what major in high school he wants to take. The boy looks at websites online to find facts about the different majors. He finds out that being a business major is quite useless compared to specializing in bio-medical engineering. This opinion is taken into account as the junior wants to be useful and help other people later on in his life. Last but not least, one must trust their mind to make the right decision. There's a process into making a solution, and it's valuable to follow. Providing your brain the time and space to make the best possible choice gives one confidence. To say the least, the final outcome involves the usage of one's mind.

To wrap it all up, making the best choice possible is made through different opinions and intelligence within one's self. It is important to realize opinions and knowledge plays a role in the decision-making process.

You will know when you got the best advice when you are getting the same answer. For example if you ask a man for directions to get to Walmart and he say take a left. Then you ask two more people and they say take a right. You will most likely take a right because more people told you to take a right then left. Getting answers from multiple people can help you make a better decision.

People always need advice, but they are most likely to ask a person they trust. That person could give them the wrong advice.

For example, you tell your friend that you need money now and he tells you to go rob a bank. Then you had got caught robbing the bank, now you are in prison for the rest of your life because you only ask for advice from one person. But if you had asked more people for advice they would of told you to apply for a better job or get a part time job. One person is not always right about a certain thing, but an other person could know the answer to your question your asking. Thats why you got to ask multiple people to get the best answer.

You don't always ask other people for advice because you think they are wrong. You could ask them for advice about what not to do on a date and they could both be right, but hsve diffrent answers. For example, one person tell you to never eat fast on a date and someone else tells you to never talk with food in your mouth. Then your date goes perfectly. But if you only had ask the first person for advice then you would have been talking with food in your mouth. Then your date could of went horrible. People experience stuff differently from the rest, so one thing could be their number one rule and someone else is totally different, but if you ask both of them then you will be more prepared then the both of them were.

You can also get advice to better understand something. People know more than each other. A person can be very good at math, but don't know how to fix a bike. Then the other other person can fix a bike, but not really that good at math. But you need help with your math homework and you need someone to teach you how to fix the chain on your bike. If you ask the person who good at math then you will only get your math homework done. If you ask the person who know how to fix a bike then you will only get your bike fixed. But If you ask bothof them, you will get both done.

People ask multiple people for advice so they can better understand or to do something the correct way and even to not make the mistake that they made. When you ask one person for advice they can only tell you what they know, but if you ask more people you could get information that the first person didn't give you. Asking more than one person could help you make the best decisions.                                                                                                        ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
CDE3CED1BF53,"Have you ever recieved helpful advice from someone? If so, that is awesome! Advice from other people is always helpful. Sometimes we can useother peoples advice and reflect on it. I feel that advice from multiple people is good because we can pick which advice would be helpful to us, we can use other peoples advice and reflect on it, and whatever advice would be the most helpful we can use that on any situation that we might be going through. That is why I am going to talk about how multiple helpful words can lead to a better life.

First I want to talk about how we can pick which advice would be most helpful to us. Everyone always words things differently. That is why it should be important that we know what advice would work more for us. Not everyones advice is going to be helpful to us that is why multiple people should share us their opinions. Someone might give you advice but then you realize that someone else might word it differently. I feel that picking the mst helpful advice is the way to go.

Next, I want to talk about how we can all reflect on peoples advice that they give us. Whatever situation that we might be in you know people are going to have our backs. As long as we can use their advice that they give us, we can tell other people about it. LetÃÂ´s say that someone is going through the same situation, we can share the advice with the and they would share the advice with someone else. Giving helpful words is like a ripple effect. That is why we should take the most helpful advice and share it with other people so that we can impact lives.

Furthermore, we all sometimes get ourselves in sticky situations. That is why we need a few friends or people we look up to get us out of sticky situations. Maybe they all some words of wisdom. We can use those words of wisdom and use it on our everyday lives. whenever we feel down or feel that we cannot get through another day we can use the advice. We should all take advice from people that are trustworthy and accountable.

All in all, taking advice from multiple people is the way to go. No matter what your going through you should always ave people by your side helping you when you need it the most. I feel that good advice gets us through life. As long as you have good friends, you should be able to take advice from them whenever you feel. I feel that advice frommultiple people is good because we can pick with advice would be helpful to us, we can always reflect on it,and whatever advice would be most helpful we can use on any situation we might be going through.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
67631924513E,"One day a little girl named Generic_Name wanted to go Bungy jumping. She was kind of nervous, because she had heard many stories. Stories that she thought were scary, and listening to those stories mad her not want to do it. Then she was thinking one day"" Why should I let what someone else thinks effect me and what I want to do."" Later that day she talked to her mom she made a list of people whom she was going to talk to about her decision she had to make. Her mom agreed with what she was talking to herself about earlier that day. Her mom said "" You know yourself not them and if this is what you want to do then do it. Don't let anyone change your mind just because they had a bad experience. You know yourself better than anyone else does even me. Regardless of what you decide to do I'm still going to be your mom and i'm still going to love you."" Then after she talked to her mom she went to go ask her granddad before making her final decision, because she knew he would help her make the right choice. She went to the basement, and when she got there before she could even start talking he said"" I heard you talking to your mom. I think exactly what she said is true, and just like her I will love you no matter what."" She smiled and said, "" Thanks grandpa."" And went to her room when she got there she knew what she had to do. She went to bed early that night, because she had a big day ahead of her.

When you ask multiple people for their opinion it can be good or bad. Like if you want to go bungy jumping and were scared. The good thing about asking is that

You get some of the same advice that's good.

You will likely talk to someone that has experience on whatever you are trying to decide to do.

Maybe they have done it before and don't think it's a good idea.

The not so good thing about asking for multiple peoples opinion is

It might become overwhelming trying to decide who to listen to.

It might be some something you don't want to hear.

Depending on the situation not many people can help you.

Asking people for their opinion is good it shows that your not selfish.

But you can't always ask and just do it based on one person. You should ask a variety of people and you will get better reasons and points of which to do it and not to do it. Advice is a good thing to get especially when your trying to make a decision and don't know what to do. Family, friends, teachers, authority figures are all people you can and should get advice from. When you ask for advice you should think about what you want advice on, the pros and the cons, who has the most reasonable advice, and who says stuff and can back up what they say. If you find that person compare what you think and that person. And sometimes if you just make the decision for yourself by yourself it isn't always the smart thing to do. Only because it could be extremely dangerous but you wouldn't know, because you just decided by yourself that you wanted to do that. Sometimes what's right isn't always what's best. And just because you get someones advice doesn't technically mean that you have to use it. They just gave it to you to be helpful and hopefully can influence you to do what's right. And you have to know the right people to ask advice from if you know someone won't give you their honest opinion, but tell you what you want to hear don't ask them. You should ask someone who doesn't agree with some decisions you make, because most of the time they can give you the best advice especially when you need it most. So next time you need advice remember not to just ask one person ask multiple before making your decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EA31BBD77334,"Do you think a problem should be looked at from one person or multiple people? I think problems should be looked at from multiple people because multiple opinions make better choices because it can be seen from multiple points of view, it could help you change the outcome and, it could help you make better choices in the future.

Seeing something from multiple points of view could help you make a better choice. It can help you make a better choice because other people might know more then you and that can help you if you are in a problem that other people can help with.

When multiple people say their opinion it can help you change the outcome. Lets say that you are in a problem and the outcome is bad, so other people say what they would do. You can change the outcome and you can change it into a better outcome.

When people give you advice in the future, it can help you make better choices in the future. Lets say that you just finished high school so you can mentor students that need help in high school. So you are giving the advice to other students that need help.

My conclusion for this is multiple opinions make better choices because it can be seen from multiple points of view, it could help you change the outcome and, it could help you make better choices in the future.

When the they ask other people including you that means they need a lot of advice for something that is really important in their life.

When you give advice you are making their life better. Sometimes people give you good advice and some give you advice that does'nt work out or go out well. When you give them good advice it can make their life better and brings more love in your life or people you really care about.

Bad advice, when someone gives you something that is not good for your health or your brain. You can give someone bad advice around people and they might follow your footsteps and do what you said and that can get them hurt or heartbroken cause you gave them the wrong advice.

Giving other people advice can help them out by giving them your honest opinion about your thinkiing of what you said.

1A5CC8CE870F,"When encountering a problem, most people will usually go to others to ask for advice or seek help. It is only natural to go to others in times of need or when encountering an unknown problem. Asking only one person for advice usually does not solve the problem, and instead, going to multiple people and asking for their opinion is the better option. Seeking multiples people's advice can help find a person who has advice on the situation, can help to find the perfect advice, and can even led to combinations of advice. That is why seeking advice from many people is the best option.

No one person goes through the same difficulties and experiences. When trying to find advice, some people may not be able to give any advice simply because they have not experienced the same problem. These people should not always be forgotten; sometimes, even though a person has not experienced a problem, they can still give advice on how to make things better or can at least give their advice on a different problem related to the current one. Other times, someone may just be bad at giving advice and can give help that does not relate to the situation currently being faced.

As stated before, no one person goes through the same difficulties which can often lead to people giving different advice. Asking multiple people for advice can often lead to finding different solutions and opinions which is only expected. This should not be taken as confusing and should instead be seen as an opportunity to find the solution that would work best. Sometimes, one person can give advice that will work perfectly for the situation at hand.

The best reason to ask for advice from multiple people is so that advice can be mixed and rearranged to make a somewhat perfect plan of action. Instead of continually asking for advice from people until the perfect result is found, advice can be combined or mixed to create the perfect solution. This method is the best for unique problems that would require unique solutions. Because even though a person may have gone through the same problem, it might have been solved differently than what would be best for you; no two rivers flow in the exact same way after all.

Overall, the best way to ask for advice is to ask from multiple people. Asking for advice from multiple different people can help find a person who has experienced the same problem, can lead to finding the best advice, and can led to mixing of advice to create what works best. That is why seeking different opinions is always the best thing to do. Advice from multiple people is always the best advice to get.                                                                                  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Its always good to get more than one opinion on something especially for tough choices.

Although one might not get the response they want; its always good to hear others opinions. Theres many reasons why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice including, getting different points of view, better understandings of the situation, and better options.

To start off, getting different points of views is what many people do. Whether it involves big choices like buying a house or if its small things like picking out a dress for prom. Decisions dont always come easy and getting advice from multiple people help with it. Although one may dislike someones opinion it can actually help them because now thats lowered their choices and made it easier to choose from.

Second, getting a better understanding of the situation from someone also helps make a better choice. The more information you have on something the easier it will be for making a choice. One might think they know everything but they dont and, that's okay. The more people one ask for advice from people the more knowledge they will gain so, its easier to make a choice.

Finally, getting advice from multiple people can open up way better options and new ideas. When one helps someone out they could show them choices they never thought of that are way better than the choices they have now. Better options will come if you have multiple people telling you new ideas and giving you so such more choices.

In conclusion, getting advice from multiple people will help you make better choices. when you ask fro advice you can get different points of views, better understandings of a situation,and better options. In my opinion, I think asking people for advice is great way to make a choice. Next time one needs advice i suggest asking multiple people.                   ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
A9872AFF064E,"As Generic_Name laid on the ground, phone in hand and face full of tissues soaked in tears and makeup. she couldn't stop the tears from falling down her cheek, as she rolled over on her side to grab her fifth jumbo box of chocolate that day. ""Why are boys so mean,"" she mumbled to herself as she slowly got up and plopped down on the bed. She turned her head to look at her phone and saw thirty text messages from Generic_Name, and a missed phone call from Generic_Name. Its almost as if her fingers moved on their own, as she turned to click on the call back button. ""Hey, i've been worried sick for you. I'm sorry about your breakup, I know how hard it must be to be going through this."" Generic_Name frowned and hung up mid speech, ""Even if it has been two months since he left me, he was someone extremely important to me. It's not that easy to forget someone who you use to love and see everyday!"" she said in a ghostly whisper that would make chills go up your spine, but all she could do was break down in tears again. Generic_Name as shown, is going through a rough breakup and is having trouble getting over it. This is something that happens more often than you may think, breakups can seriously injure someone. It can injure their mental health, and leave them in a confused and sad state questioning what they did wrong, and what they could have done to fix it. It can be difficult to go through something like this alone, and you may need someone to listen to you and give you advice so that you can make the right choices. It can be one person or more. It can give you a better view of things, gives you more options, and opinions.

Getting a good view of a situation is extremely important, since it can affect the way of the outcome. If you are in the dark for a situation, than chances are that your not gonna understand whats going on. That's exactly what's going on for Generic_Name, she is confused with whats happening and is staying in the dark, and that can make the problem harder for her. If you have someone there, they can talk to you and give you their thoughts and view on it. Instead of hanging up on Generic_Name, she should have listened to what she was gonna say. She could have asked Generic_Name what she thinks about whats going on, and she would have helped her and told her what she thinks. Generic_Name could have also called more people she feels comfortable with and told them the same thing and seen what they think of it too so that she can see what other peoples views are and get a better picture of what's going on and how to fix it.

Talking to people can also give you new options on what to do. When in a situation like this, you could feel lost and unsure of what is right and what isn't. You may stay in the same place for awhile trying to think of something but in the end not happy with it. Generic_Name is just staying in her room eating chocolate and laying on the ground, she isn't sure of what to do or what even the right thing to do is. She is lost and unsure. Talking to people can give you new ideas on what to do for this situation, and they give you options that you may have not come up with by yourself. Generic_Name is clearly worried for her and she wants the best for her, she could have told her to talk to someone she feels comfortable with. Going on a jog, getting a breath of fresh air, or even therapy can help with things like this. These are all options that would help Generic_Name feel better. Talking to more than one person can help a ton more, since everyone has different way that helps them. One thing that helps one person could not help Generic_Name, but something that someone else does could help her. She could make a better choice, Generic_Name could decide to take the choices Generic_Name gave her instead of locking herself up in her room.

Getting someones opinion can be very helpful when your unsure of something, asking someone what they think about it is one of the best things you can do for yourself. You get second thoughts on what your doing, and it can be best when asking a group of people since they will all share their opinions and you get to hear what they think. Generic_Name could listen to the opinions Generic_Name and Generic_Name have for what's going on, and that could help her think about what to do next. Of course it's important not to take all opinions seriously but you just have to make sure to grab the right ones. If she listens and does take the right ones, than this could help her make better choices and be sure of what she wants.

""Thank you guys so much, I don't know what I would have done if you guys didn't give me that great advice!"" said Generic_Name with a huge smile across her face. Generic_Name and Generic_Name smiled but both ended up laughing with joy, proud to have their old friend back. they all flopped down in the green grass and looked up at the bright blue sky, covered by fluffy white clouds that looked so fluffy you could fall asleep on them. ""I never knew that talking to you both and hearing your thoughts and opinions would affect me so much. Now I know, that it's good to ask people for advice so that I make the right choices."" Generic_Name closed her eyes and exhaled, happy that she asked for advice on her problems. These are my reasons for why I believe it's good to get advice that helps you make better choices.

2CD45C47FFE6,"sometimes talking to more than one person get can get you threw a lot of things in life and help you become a better person as well. Also seeking multiple opinions and advises can help you think about how to or make better choices by thinking more wisely before doing something that may look or sound like a better choice to you but might actually be a bad choice. And think about the consequences you will have If you don't decide to make the right choices.

In my opinion, When you do decide to talk to more than one person and let them give you advises and opinions on your decisions and help you think more wisely about your choices. Then you would have more support from more than one person that could help you get threw good choices and bad choices. And also, help you with whatever your going threw at the moment. And you would also have a lot of advises and opinions that more than one person gave you to think about. And some of those people that you can ask for advises and opinions can be someone that you actually believe Is a real friend, or any adult that you decide you trust, such as teacher's, your guardian's/parents, and counselor's.

Also seeking multiple opinions and advises Is always the right thing to let someone do for you, because all those advises and opinions can help you make smarter and better choices In life, and make you think about the consequences, and think more wisely before doing something that may look and sound like a better choice for you but might actually be a bad choice to do. Also think about the people you surround yourself with, like those that you consider as your ""friends"" because sometimes those ""friends"" can be the one's stopping you from making good choices, and be the ones that could be leading you to the bad choices. And those type of ""friends"" aren't the ones that you would want to be surrounded with for the rest of your life, or even communicating with.

In conclusion, I personally think its best to let more than one person give you advises and letting them seek in multiple opinions for you because, sometimes its good to listen to more than one persons opinions and advises because, It can help you get threw a lot of things and become a better person in life. And also, by letting people seek in opinions for you It can help you make the right choices and avoid the wrong ones.

0FC32E083BDE,"Why do people need advice? Typically it's to make the best decision possible. Now some people only ask for one opinion on their situation because it's easier to only listen to one person, but this isn't helping you make the best decision. People should ask for multiple peoples opinions instead of just one person. Different people have different ways of life, different ideas and opinions, and different experiences.

Everyone has a different way of life. One person might be rich while the other might be poor. Obviously these two people probably have different opinions on your situation. Any person could. Many people have different mindsets and different styles of living. One person might give up easily, while another pushes through. Then there might be a person who doesnt give up or push through, they find a different solution. The way you live your life alters your mindset. Thats why its so interesting to hear others advice and their opinions.

Everybody has different ideas and opinions. No one person is exactly like the other. My parents are very different from each other, but that's why I love getting advice from both of them. My mom is more of an pessimist while my dad is a realist. They have completely different outlooks on life, but both outlooks help me make the best decision possible. Although people can have similar ideas they are probably different in at least one way. So I encourage you to find advice in the diversity of two or more peoples thoughts.

Different people have different experiences. If you ask a person for advice they might not have gone through what you are going through. On the other hand if you ask multiple people you have a mix of experiences and maybe some that are very similar to yours. You get to have the option to listen to someone who has been through what you're going through and hear about what they did or didn't do. You can also learn about what regrets that person might have from back then and apply their experience to your own life. Even if you get advice from someone that hasn't gone through what you are their lives have formed them into who they are. They may have been through more than you know and their advice could be the best out of every ones. Just because everyone has a different life doesnt mean that they can't have similar experiences, and even if they don't have similar experiences that doesn't mean that they cant give great advice.

Some people only get one opinion on a situation while others get many. Multiple opinions is better than one though because everyone has different ways of life, different ideas, and different experiences. Next time you need to make a decision ask many people for their opinion. You might just be surprised by how much it helps.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F843F47EB767,"There are many people who have been through a lot in life. So it is smart to see other peoples opinons when you feel it is necesarry. The more people you talk to the more opinions you have to go off of for your choice. As you get more opinions you can narrow it down and see the different good opinions and bad opinions. I think that talking to more people for advice is a great idea.

People all over the world have experienced different things. So some people might feel very strongly on your topic, in that case they would be a great person for advice. It makes them a better option than some other people. Some people in this world have barely experienced anything so they wouldn't have a strong opinion.

The more advice you get the more you can narrow down your decission and be more confident with it. You may get some bad advice or opinions and you may get some good ones. But you must go through all of your advice and see which ones are good and the most supported.

By talking to more people you can make a pros and cons list of opinions. That will help you see the good and the bad. Somethings just aren't worth the risk but you have to figure out what those things are. Life can be hard but that's why you ask people that you know have been through it for advice. It's your job to know if things are worth it or not.

All in all, I think that asking other people for advice is a great thing to do. It can benefit you in so many ways and it could potentially save your life.

06B1E9A43C96,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. They belive that they have a better chance at making the right choice. There are many reasons why people seek multiple opinions, one might be trustworthiness , another would be the more wiser person, and the last reason is that people might get you out of trouble.

One reason why people might ask for multiple opinions is trustworthiness. What I mean by that is a person might trust one person more than he trusts the other. One person might be closer to you than the other. The one closer to you might know more about you and knows how you feel. If you ask someone you dont really talk to then maybe they try to be funny and make you look stupid. If it was a friend then it would be different because they don't want to see you fail or they won't betray you. Also if you ask one person and they betray you and make you look stupid then you will learn your lesson to not ask them for help ever again.

Another reason to ask multiple people is to ask the more wiser person . What I mean by that is one person might be more wiser and knowledgabe than the other. If you ask a person that has been in that type of situation then they might know what to do and how to handle it. It's either they made the wrong decision and knows how to fix it. Or he made the right decision and knows what to do. Either way it is better to ask some one who has been in that problem before and got out of it safetly than asking someone who has never been in the type of problem and does'nt have any advice.

The last reason is that maybe someone can get you out of trouble. What I mean is that if you are planning up something to do that is not very good, someone might stop you and tell you that it is not a very good choice to make.

It could also refer back to people being in the same situation you are. The person that has been in your shoes one time might have been planning up to do the same but they got in big trouble and regreted it. So they would warn you and tell you the punnishment and it might change your mind. Seeking multiple opinions would tell you how to handle the problem or even stop it if your not even a victom.

Seeking multiple opinions is'nt bad after all. You can learn how to fix a probblem or even stop one. You can learn who to trust and who not to trust. Those are all ways seeking multiple opinions can help you in a problem.    ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

When people usually ask for advice its more likely that they are going to ask more than one person because they want to make the best choice that is for them. By doing this you can make better choices, make your decisions faster, and you can also help others around you yo make better decisions.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better decisions. First, when people ask multiple opinions for advice he or she are most likely going to make better decisions because when seeking multiple opinions you have more than one choices to choose from. For example, if a person is going around asking for advice whether if he or she should own a pet, he or she will have many choices to choose from due to the number of people he or she asked. Secondly, some people might even come across having the same advice from different people. For instance, if a girl is asking people advice for how to take care of a cat most people would say that ""you have to feed them daily and clean their litter box once or twice a week."" Therefore, by seeking multiple opinions sometimes it's best if people seek more than one opinion.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make decisions faster. To begin with, usually when people have more than one decision, he or she can choose their best choice quicker. For instance, if someone is debating whether if he or she should get a new car or not, he or she has a better chance of making the decision faster because of the amount of information and opinions he or she has. Furthermore, it also makes it easier to make a decisions because some people might have bad advice or information, so it will be easier if you eliminate the choices that you think are the worst. As a result, seeking multiple opinions can help people make decisions faster and easier.

Seeking multiple opinions can help some other people. First, if you are able to collect information then it is most likely that you can help out a friend make better decisions. For example, if one of your friends is having trouble deciding whether he or she should buy a new phone. You could probably help them out in the same way you did for yourself. Furthermore, you can even help him or her by doing the work together meaning that both you and your friend can work everything out so he or she could get the job done. As a result, he or she probably made a better choice because you helped her or him through the process.

In conclusion, when people are seeking opinions they tend to ask more than one person because they want to be able to make better decisions, make their decisions faster, and they can help others.             ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
262A455A7060,"lets say that you need to make a choice about something important like college, or what classes your going to take in high school. Would you rather have one opinion about that topic or have multiple opinions? We can also say that the one opinion could either be a good choice or a bad one. But with multiple opinions or views, you can depict from the good and the bad and have that help you make your decision. It would be better to have multiple opinions because you can compare opinions, get different ideas from people, and one opinion isn't always going to be the right choice.

My first reason is that you can get multiple views from different people and compare them. Generic_Name, a researcher from the university of Kentucky ran a poll about this topic. The poll had multiple choices from getting multiple opinions to getting no opinions at all. There were five choices, getting no opinions, getting one opinion, getting a multiple opinions, getting opinions to compare them, and trusting one opinion. There was no shock at all when it had the highest percentage of 54%. The winner was to get multiple opinions to compare them. Even the majority of people think it's right to get multiple decisions than one. I agree with the majority and think it's right to have multiple decisions to choose from and compare the reasoning behind why. The second most with a percentage of 39% was getting multiple decisions which is basically the same as the most. I still agree that this is the second most because I think that getting at least multiple designs is better than one decision or zero decisions. You can't always count on one decision no matter what it is. There was a even split with a percentage of 3 percent for trusting one opinion and getting one opinion. They are both so similar so this makes sense that they have the same percentage. And with a whopping one percent was getting no opinions at all. I am just shocked that someone actually picked no opinions. That poll I liked because I agree with the order that people picked what was better and what was the greatest picked and the least favorite picked.

Another reason why getting multiple choices helps you make a better choice is that you can get different ideas from what other people think. Not everyone thinks the same, so that means there will be a variety of choices that can help you. A rookie in the NBA Steven Shaw had something to say about this. ""When I was going into college, I had a choice between playing basketball or football. I coundn't pick between them because I loved both sports, but didn't know what will be the right choice for me. I asked my mom and dad, and they both said basketball. I asked some of my friends and the majority said I should play football. It was about a even split after all those people answered. And then I asked my grandfather and I always knew he would sail me into the right direction. He said basketball and that meant the majority wanted me to play football. But I got better reasoning from the people that wanted me to play basketball. I could've just listened to a friend and played what he said, but one decision isn't always correct. Plus I can see that playing basketball was a better choice."" He asked so many people instead of just one. He got different answers from different people and the majority of people he asked wanted him to play football. Even though there were more people wanting him to play football, he thought the ideas from people wanting him to play basketball were better reasons than the people who wanted him to play football. This is why you don't just listen to one person and take their opinion. I think he made the right decision and was smart about it.

My final reason to help make better choices with more opinions is that one opinion isn't always going to be the right choice. A study from the university of Michigan did a study on something similar to this. They asked people on the streets of New York City about this and got reasoning. They all gave different reasoning but almost all of them said having multiple opinions is better. Even people in New York said getting multiple opinions can turn you the right way. There was one person, Generic_Name, who gave excellent detail on why. She stated that ""multiple opinions that influence your choices can be good or bad. There are ones that change your thinking and ones that makes you wonder. But getting influenced by someones opinions can really change how you think of things. So it is defiantly better that you have multiple opinions to help you decide."" II think the way she thinks is incredible and she seems really smart with the way she put it. It defiantly depends on how you think of things.

As we have seen, it's pretty obvious that getting multiple opinions will help you the most with decision making. Reasons like you can get different ideas from people, get multiple views and compare them, and learning that one opinion isn't always the right choice. If you were going to college and had a decision between two of them. Would you get multiple decisions from different people and have that affect your choice?",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
9F58F5814567,"One day if kids really cared people might ask other people for their opinions if they need help, for example say you asked three different people like parents teens,friends or teachers for their advice or their opinion,and they all say different things and you only have to pick one, yeah it might be hard but you just have to pick one. Not every ones response is the right choice for you because it cold be good when you hear it but when it happens its all over for you. Say you told your friends that you tried out for track and seen this really cute boy that you like and so you asked you friends for their opinion or advice from them and so what is the three girls said oh go talk to him,and the other say go ask him out,and you listened to them and so you walked up to him and ask him out and he was like ummmm... I have a girl,then its all over for you and the chance you could of had when they broke up. Not everyone you ask for there opinion is going to tell good stuff and you also need to use your brain and think before you go asking your friends. But the good thing is about asking people for their opinion is that they could tell you the right stuff you need to know. If you have real friends you already know they not gonna tell you no wrong stuff. Talking to you parent could be hard but at the same time you need a relationship with them because you could talk to you mom about personal hygiene you aint know about,and talk about boys. Having a relationship with your dad could be weird if your a girl but he could protect you from the bad stuff. Therefor talking to your teachers yeah they give you good advice for like coming to school for an education,and bullies and some time whats happening at home,but dont ask people you barely know because they could get you caught up in the mix and get you in trouble,and or heart broken. Although asking close friends,or teachers,and or you mom or dad witch ever one you are closer with. Asking people is good for like when you don know what to do and or you know what you wanna do but you know that if you do it that its bad or you just cant do and and you need some advice to not be scared. but its good to ask for advice from other people just to try new things and try to trust people.

Even choices as simple as that you can make the wrong choice. So should you ask for advice from multiple people, absolutely. asking for help is not a bad thing and you learn more when you ask.

when making a choice you have your opinion and you might think this is the right choice but you are not 100%, so what do you do. well you don't go cry in your room, you have to investigate. You don't always have to ask people, sometimes you can find your answer online or in a book, but the easiest way to find the right choice is to ask a person that is alive. ask them the question, ""should I study for this minor test"" someone might say ""yes always study"" and others might say ""no its a small test there is no point"". then what you do is find out who said more of one choice and think about it for a period of time depending on how big the question was, then go with your best choice and hopefully it's the right one.

to ensure that you don't make a stupid choice like what collage you should attend, do exactly what this essay is about ask people and they will tell you more information and will make you see things in a different way so you don't make a bad decision. overall I feel like it is smart to ask and think about your choice rather than just making one quickly and making a bad one.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
CFAF62184AB2,"Have you ever asked someone to give an opinion on a choice you had to make? Whether that could be asking your best friend what color suits you the best, or getting advice from your mom on why it isn't so smart to finish your math homework by 3 in the morning? See, when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, which can be very helpful than just receiving it from only your mom or best friend. It's important to seek multiple opinions when making a decision because it can help someone make a better choice, teach someone something new, and can even encourage someone to gain a different, or new perspective to a situation.

To begin with, more advice on a problem or incident can convince someone to make a better choice. First of all, more opinions could lead to choices that are much better than what that person could've previously thought of. Gaining opinions from a variety of people can seek out better choices compared to what that person might've thought of before getting any particular advice. Second of all, advice from others could save someone from thinking they have more options than limits. Working with multiple people can express more ideas and solutions than working with just one or two. And lastly, someone could create a better decision from all the opinions and advice they've gathered from the ones they've sought help for. People could either think alike or quite differently, so summarizing any key points from the opinions you received could create an even better solution to a problem, or situation. Making a better choice isn't so hard when there's more than one person helping you!

Additionally, gaining opinions of others could teach someone something new. Firstly, talking to someone about a situation or problem will not only aid you from reaching a solution, it could also lead you to learning more about that person who's guiding you. Everyone has different backgrounds and stories that builds up to who they are now, and maybe then you'll realize you're not so different compared to them after all!

Secondly, the person who's giving advice to that certain someone can drop them a new idea or fact they've probably never heard of before. It's never too late to learn how to fix a problem or situation in a totally unique way, or even learn an interesting fact that probably correlates to what's happening to you! Last but not least, people's advice or opinions could help you learn a lesson. Everything happens for a reason and therefore, seeking the advice of multiple people could help you learn what the lesson it teaching you. We always learn something new everyday, even if that's at school, at home, or even in your community!

Lastly, the difference of advice and opinions of other people can even help someone gain a new perspective on a certain situation. To start off with, encouraging someone to think differently on something can drastically change how they view a problem. Someone might think that there is no solution to a situation, but if you help them look at the other side of things, you might have the ability to convince them otherwise. Additionally, opinions from others might change their negative mindset to a positive one. Someone could be pessimistic to a situation or incident, so seeking advice from more than one person could heighten the chance of changing that mindset to an optimistic one! Finally, receiving advice or opinions from many people can change how they view their original solution to a problem. The image of how they view a solution to a situation can aid them into seeing a new light in something they're dealing with. Multiple perspectives have the ability to change a single one!

In conclusion, it's helpful to search for many opinions when making a choice for the reason that you could create a better decision, be taught something new, and it could even help you gain a different image on a problem.

Making a better choice isn't as difficult when multiple people are guiding you, and it can also be very helpful to learn something new from those opinions or aid from others. The multiple advice and opinions could even change the perspective on how you view a situation or difficulty in your life. And just remember, the ideas inside two to three heads will, for sure, work much more better than one!                                                                 ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
8093D01B2742,"Have you ever been in a situation where you have to make a hard choice and don't know what to do? There are many reasons why it is very important to ask for multiple opinions of advice. Some of the best reasons are because you get different points of view, you make better choices, and your choice doesn't reflect just one view.

The first reason I think it is important to ask for multiple opinions of advice is because you get different points of view. Sometimes one person's advice might not be the best choice for your situation. An example for this would be if you had to choose between going to a track meet or going to your sister's birthday party. If you get different points of view then it will help you make a well-rounded decision. Some people you ask might have been in a similar situation and have really good advice for which event to go to. Also if there are any people who have to choose between the 2 things too, ask them what they have decided on and why. All of these reasons will help you make a good decision.

The second reason I think that asking for multiple points of view is important is that you make better choices. If you just base your final decision off of what you think, you might regret it. Sometimes when you ask for advice, you realize things you never thought of. Like the example in the last paragraph, someone that you ask might remind you that it is your state track meet. This would greatly influence your final decision because that might be your most important meet of the season. This also helps you think about the long-term effect of your choice. How will this effect other people? How will this make me look? All of these things should be taken into consideration before making your final choice.

The final reason I think that asking for multiple opinions of advice is your choice doesn't reflect just one view. World leaders have to make choices all the time. Their choice needs to reflect the country's view. If the world leader made a choice based just on what he thought, then the country would probably get mad. If the leader asks for advice from co-workers or citizens then the country will be happy with the choice. The presidential election is a really good example of this because the electoral college has to choose the presidential nominee that the citizens want the most. If they just picked a random candidate then the country's citizens would be mad at the government. This method however of asking people for advice to make a better choice can be used for any situation big or small.

As you can see, asking for multiple views of advice can be very helpful in any situation. Just always remember to ask multiple people, make a decision that doesn't only reflect your point of view, and think about how your choice will effect other people involved. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F53C55BBD326,"When you are asking for advice, it is smart for you to ask for multiple opinions on the subject. For example, if you wanted to know what you should wear to a social gathering, it would be best to ask more than one person for advice. By asking multiple peoples opinions, you are be able to see what people of various ages and style standpoints have to say about certain clothing. Asking for more than one persons advice and opinions on a subject is a great way to make the best choice about something.

One reason why seeking multiple opinions on something is a great way to make important decisions is because if you dont't, you could end up being offensive towards somebody. An example would be if you are going to a costume party and you want to wear something inspired by a certain culture, you should ask multiple people. This is the best way to go about making this choice, because if you just ask one persons opinion, that one person might lead you in the wrong direction. If you ask multiple people for advice, you are able see how certain people would react and what they have to say. Knowing different opinions on something is wonderful because it helps you better understand how to be respectful.

Not only does seeking more than one opinion on something help you make the best choices and be respectful of others, but it can also help you in the future. Your actions are never really forgotten. They can be forgiven, or almost forgotten, but they will always be tucked in your mind or somebody else's mind. Sometimes people aren't very cautious about what they say or do, and they don't think about how others might get affected by their actions. Asking multiple people for advice is greatly rewarding because it gives you a sense of many opinions and feelings on a certain subject. Having good and varying advice can help stop you from doing something you might regret later on. Instead of jumping to conclusions and caving in to your impulse, you should ask as many people as you can for advice. That way, you can have time to think about what to do in a bad situation.

In conclusion, knowing and asking for multiple opinions is the best way to make your choices in life. If you don't seek for more than one persons advice, you could end up in a bad situation. People of different cultures, ages, and moral views will come up with different advice. Asking multiple people for advice is a great way to correctly make important decisions in your life. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
79AA889C2340,"You should always talkk to more than one person if you want multiple opinions based on a topic. because it can give you more Results, Conformation, and Details. All three of these are things you can get from multiple opinions because if you ask ten people about one topic you will get more Results, Details, and conformation. So these three items to use can be very helpful in a situation.

Results are a key of multiple opinions because each person has a diffrent side to one story. Going for results from a murder you have to interview people who where there or could have seen anything. And the results you get out of all of them you add it up to see which one could have been the culprit. So results are very important when it comes to many things because it can solve a problem. Multiple opinions can give you results just because you get alot of information from doing so.

Details are a key of multiple opinions because details are specific information. The details can be like information that was left behind so multiple opinions have alot in common because some will tell a lie and some wont. So you use Details which are like items, emotions, etc to tell you what might have happened. A multiple opion gives you lots of things because your asking more than one person on a topic which doing this gives you details which you have to look for while talking to people. The amount of details you can get from one opinion is insane because you get more than ten or twenty to help the topic your are doing.

Conformation is the biggest key of multiple opinions because even though details and results tell you everything you need to confirm everything before you make a descision. The conformation has to always be right because if you make the wrong descision it will cost you. Because you can ruin someones life or opportunitys based on your one wrong decision. So you want to make sure that you are one hundred percent sure on your decision before you do anything else. once you have made your decision there is no going back because you cant change what you did.

Getting multiple opinions is always a good way to start something off. Because the results tell you what happened, details tell how it happened and what caused it, and conformation means you are one hundered percent sure you know the cause, and what happened. So sticking to multiple choice is good but always be careful use these three to get what you want out of a story or what you want to use it for. but you have to use them carefully because you dont know what might happen next.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Also getting advise can help alot of problems , when people , friends , and family ask for advise sometimes they dont know what to do or say .

F1E0CBCC1AE5,"If you were in a horrible situation and you had no idea what to do, would you ask your dad for advice or your mom? If i was the one in the situation I would ask my mom, dad, and other role models that are in my life. Why would you just ask for advice from one person when you can get many answers and choose which one is best. I think that asking multiple people is better because you will have multiple options.

Just think, what if you asked someone for advice and they weren't completely sure what to say. They wouldn't want to let you down and not help you at all. So they could give some bad advice because they didn't know what to say. If you asked multiple people then someone might understand you more than others and they might give you better advice. If you ask multiple people the same question then they might all give you the same answers and that would show you that that's what you should do.

If the problem was between you and your friend and you only ask one person for advice and it isn't very good advice then it could just make the problem worse. If you were to ask multiple people and you choose which one would be best for the problem then it could just fix the problem right away. Plus, asking multiple people show you who is good at giving certain advice. Your dad might not be good at giving relationship advice, but he could be good at giving cooking and sports advice. Your mom or aunt might be the one that you go to when you seek relationship advice.

Asking many people could open up your eyes to many things. Maybe the fight between you and your friend happens often and you mom tells you that you could be in a hurtful friendship. You could loose a friend, but it could have been for the best. I never asked my uncle for advice on stuff, but I asked him once and he gave really good advice and now my uncle and I are very close. That could be the case with you too. Some problems can bring other people together and it could be you and your aunt, dad, older cousin, grandmother or uncle. It could be anybody and you just wouldn't know until you asked.

Remember, asking other people can't and won't do you any harm. The worst that can happen is you don't use one of their suggestions, and if it works out then the people you asked won't care if you used their advice or not. They will just be happy for you that you got out of your situation and that everything is resolved. Do not be afraid to ask someone for advice because you think it's embarising.

DAC85E32DCED,"Sticky situations, we've all been through one of those in our lives. It may not always be a sticky situation, instead, just a tough decision your going to have to make. Making your own decision can lead to either a positive outcome or a negative outcome, but in order to prevent that you can talk to more than one person before making a decision. Talking to more than one person before a choice or decision can be beneficial in many ways.

Asking others before a though choice is scientifically proven that you will most likely end up making the right decision according to students at Howard University .

Ways they have been proven is that there are people who are successful and stories behind it. For example, Bill Gates at a young age used to work with Steve Jobs who was a very successful businessman behind the company Apple, and Steve Jobs didnt quite acknowledge a young,bright,open-minded,intelligent

Bill Gates. Bill Gates knew that he was very smart but he had a really tough choice to make, that choice was to either surprise the world and make his own dynasty out of a company or stick with

Steve Job's Apple, What came to Bill Gates mind was that he wanted to stay with Steve Jobs

Because he was already very popular and high marketing, but before making a decision he went on and asked a few people and those people had a thought in mind that Bill Gates is very smart and that with his knowledge and study he could easily thrash Steve Jobs. Bill Gates listened to his friends and after years of work and study he made his own Company Microsoft and shocked the world and is now recognized as one of the most successful businessman in the world and one of the most wealthy as well. What we learned out of this is that when you ask people to assist you on a tough choice your going to have to make you will most likely end up making the right choice.

Not asking for advice before leaping onto a solution can make you regret it later on. Now say if you were shopping at a local convenience store and one day you saw a bunch of money on the floor, you have no idea where it came from but still decided to take some money. Then the next day you think of all the bad outcomes that can happen all because of the money you decided to take secretly, what you could have done to make a better choice was to ask multiple people or at least someone else. Because that way the person could have told you to ask the cashier at the store if they knew someone reported that they lost their money or to just leave it their and maybe the owner of the money could comeback and take back their money. But that still can leave you with a feeling of regret, so what you can do next time is ask someone to give you advice before making an action so you don't end up with a feeling of regret.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
76D459CE0410,"I, personally think its always better to talk to more than one person, for advice. Going to more than one person for advice, is good but it just has to be someone you trust. You shouldn't just talk to anyone about your problems though.

Seeking advice from more than one person is always better because some people give better advice than others, it can change how you feel, and change your actions.

A reason its always better to go to more than one person for advice is because some give better advice than others. For example, your mother may give you better advice than your friends will because she knows you better than your friends do. Then again, your friends may give better advice than your mother will because you might be scared to get judged or to open up to your mother. A trusted adult may give you better advice than your parents will. Bad advice can influence and effect you in many ways. All the advice you get, may just depend on the person. Someone can give you bad advice, then the other person you talk to, may give you good advice.

All the advice just depends on the person because everyone was raised differently. Some believe and think differently than others.

The second reason you should go to more than one person for advice is because certain advice can change the way you feel. Some advice can also change the way you look at things. You will look at the bigger picture about sitautions. For example, if you feel a type of way about a conflict you had with someone then, you go to your friend about whatever the case may be, her advice can change the way you feel about the whole situation. You might think the whole conflict was childish after, you had that talk with your friend. That advice your friend gave you about that whole situation, may make you even want to aplogize to the person you had that conflict with.

Another reason you should go to more than one person for advice is because the advice can change your actions. Advice can change your actions just like how it can change your feelings. Some advice can make you want to do postivite and negative things. Advice can make you want to apologize, have a talk, sort things out, and many more things. Some words can make you change your actions. For example, you wanted to fight someone then you had a talk with your mom about that scenario. That long talk you had with your mom, can make you want to talk things out. It doesn't even have to be a long talk, a few wise words can make you want to change your actions.

The best thing to do is get advice from more than one person. Its best to get advice from more than one person because it can change your actions, some give better advice than others, and it can also change how you feel. Advice can make you look at the bigger picture. Advice can also teach you not everything needs a reaction. A few words and opinons can change your whole perspective about a situation.

D7497B662A49,"Imagine you've gotten into an argument, you don't know what to do or what you should say to the person you had just fought. You're completely stuck. Many people have to deal with these types of situations multiple times throughout their lives. They just don't know what to do. Some people make decisions on their own, and others decide to take advice from others. Some even self reflect on their own opinions and then decide to seek help from others to listen to their opinions on what to do. I believe seeking more than one opinion from others helps make better choices by helping you see many different sides of a situation, you'll know what is the best thing to do more than if you just heard one opinion, and you'll personally feel like you made a better choice.

Taking opinions from multiple people help you hear different sides, therefore helping you make better decisions. If someone just listens to themselves and their opinions they'll only hear one side on things. Deciding to listen to other people helps because you'll hear from multiple different view points, so you then can decide what is right and what is wrong. For example I've been in many different arguments with my family, so I decided to talk to my friends about what I should do. Talking to multiple of my friends, not just one, and hearing what all of them had said helped me decide who was right or wrong and what would be the ethical thing to do in result of that. Therefore, listening to others and their side on what ever had happened helps in making better choices.

Deciding to take advice and listen to the opinions of multiple people helps you know what is the best thing to do when making difficult decisions and choices. Only listening and taking advice from yourself or just one other person may not be the best idea. By taking advice from more than one other person and if multiple people give the same advice, you'll know what the best decision would be. By having the majority of the people say the same thing for you to do, you'd have clarity and be sure that what advice they gave was good advice. For example, imagine that you're being bullied so you decide to tell your friends. Some say to fight back but the majority say to tell an adult, so you know you should tell an adult instead of fighting back because the majority said so.

Choices could be good overall if you feel better about what you decided to do after listening to different view points. Just thinking to yourself that you have made a good decision makes what you decided to do or say in a difficult situation a good decision because you're convincing yourself. If someone decides to talk to multiple different people, they'll know they tried their best in order to make good choices. This is because the multiple amount of people all gave advice, so you had many different choices to go off of. Knowing that the most amount of people you talked to said the same one thing helps you know that it would be a safer bet to go with what the majority said. Overall, knowing that you tried your best helps you feel like you did something good.

Seeking advice and opinions from multiple people helps in making better decisions by knowing what is the best thing to do more than if you just heard your own opinion, personally feeling you made a better choice by taking advice from more than one person, and by helping you see many different points of views. Listening to many different people's advice is extremely helpful when making important decisions and choices. If not done by someone, they'll most likely end up making a poorer decision or choice than what they could have done if they decided to listen to multiple people.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
FD8A9514C8BC,"Not too long ago I got into a disagreement with one of my best friends, this made me a little sad. But something that always helped me feel better was talking to trusted people about it. Receiving opinions from multiple people can help someone decide on a better choice because they can view the other persons perspective, they will get honest feedback, and they might find out more information on the situation.

Getting advice from different people can help you see multiple perspectives on the situation. The trusted person helping you can show you how the other person might be feeling. Sometimes knowing how they feel can change your point of view on things. The friend or family member can inform you on what you did wrong. Even if the opposing person hurt your feelings, there is a high chance you have hurt them as well! If you are confused on what the problem is they can show you what it is or how it started. For me, I need to understand how the problem started before I resolve it. Understanding how the other person felt, knowing what the problem is, and realizing what you did wrong are important things the trusted people helping you can do for you to make a better choice.

The person you are seeking advice from can inform you with more facts about the situation. They might have gone through the same thing in the past and know how to handle it. I feel a sense of relief to know that they understand what I am going through. If you are talking to a friend they will most likely already know about the situation and can help you out more than you think. Depending on how much they know, you'll have a clear understanding of what happened and feel comfortable enough to make a good decision. Another way you can get more knowledge is figuring out how you can prevent this from happening again in the future. That is something you're gonna need! Getting advice from someone who already knows about the problem, has dealt with the same thing in the past, and keeping the advice for the future are perfect reasons why you should seek advice from not just one person, but a few.

Lastly, the trusted person who is helping you will give you honest feedback. They will help you choose the best way to handle the situation. It always makes me feel better when the person giving me advice knows how to help me. The person can tell you if your choice is the best or not. You will most likely feel better after getting ""the okay"" from another person. Talking to a trusted person will make you feel more comfortable, especially knowing you aren't getting lied to. By then you will feel ready to make a great choice. Knowing if your decision is good or not, being told how to handle it, and talking to someone who won't lie to you will truly help you decide on a better choice.

Asking people for advice can sometimes help you make a better choice. Viewing other peoples perspective, getting more information on the topic, and getting honest feedback can help you decide on a better choice. Do you thing talking to more than one person can help you make a better choice?",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
F93D06BC99D8,"Once, there was a woman named Generic_Name who was tasked with budgeting her family's money and spending it in the best way. She needed to decide whether to stay home during Spring break and spend a little more on food and eating out more often, or she could go on a vacation and use less money on dining out. There is no bad decision here, she thinks, but the vacation that her family wants is very expensive so budgeting would be harder. She asks her friend, Generic_Name, who just took a family vacation, about whether she should take out money to spend on this lavish vacation. She decides, based on Generic_Name's opinion and based on her own, that she should allot funds to this vacation that the family wants over Spring break, and eat out less often. She found later that she made the poorer of the two decisions. Did you know that many people around the world receive advice every day, and learn that the advice they received was incorrect. Those people deeply regret their decision that they made earlier that was incorrect. Seeking multiple opinions when you are making a decision helps you make a better choice because it allows you more views of a topic, it gives you a higher chance of having correct advice, and it is mathematically easier to make a decision with multiple opinions.

When you seek multiple opinions, it gives you more views of your decision to be made by allowing you to see both sides, takes into account minor issues and discrepancies, and it gives you a better selection of viewpoints and opinions. As you seek multiple opinions, you can see different sides of the issue that you maybe didn't know about. While this happens, you can find minor issues in your argument or point of view. These issues can be easily resolved before you make the decision, but after the decision happens, it is final and cannot be changed. By asking many people their ideas, you can get a better selection of viewpoints and opinions, just like in a research project, where you want to get information from multiple sources, not just ones that you agree with. When you combine all three of these reasons, you can find the better outcome that there is to be chosen from in your decision that you are making. Furthermore, with these multiple views, you will most likely get correct advice.

When you are seeking advice you will have a higher chance of finding the correct decision because getting multiple options can make finding the general consensus easier, it can help you in finding poor decisions, and it gives you past decisions to see what happened and what might happen to you. When you know several opinions, you have a better understanding of how others feel about the issue and can reach a general consensus, what the majority of people think, about the topic that you are deciding upon, which can make the correct advice easier to find. By seeking multiple opinions, you can find which ones are poor choices and which ones are ingenious ideas and doing this can make finding correct advice easier. If you seek multiple opinions, you may find out that others have had to make the same decision and had a positive outcome who'se decision you may want to follow. You also may find people who have made bad choices that you would not want to follow. By doing these three things, you increase your chances of finding correct information in the advice that others give you. If you get correct advice by asking multiple people, or if you don't ask anyone and make the wrong choice, you would be on trend mathematically with how many people you talk to, and your result.

There is a mathematical trend that is if you talk to less people about a decision to be made, you will more likely make a poor one, but if you get a general consensus, you should be able to make the correct decision. For many decisions, you don't need advice of your peers, but some do, and it is best for those that you get more than one opinion. Studies have shown, that the more sources you have, the more likely you are to make a correct decision, and likewise, the less sources you have, the weaker your decision will be. When you have more people's opinions, you have a higher chance of finding the general consensus and making the correct decision. By mathematics and by logic, you should be able to find correct advice if you have more opinions and beliefs.

Generic_Name found out much later that she made the wrong decision about the Spring break vacation. While her family was on vacation, she learned that there was a Martian Flu outbreak at her office and she will not be able to work along with her husband, who was recently fired.

When Generic_Name made the decision, she should have known that many of her coworkers had Martian Flu and that it was starting to spread when she planned the vacation. She lost two paychecks and they had to live on savings for a few months until they ran out of savings. Generic_Name's husband got a loan from the bank and they barely had enough food to survive, but Generic_Name learned her lesson. This lesson was when making a major decision, you should seek multiple opinions before you make the final decision. When people make a decision, they sometimes don't get a second or third opinion, and they make a poor choice. If only these people were able to make a better decision and be given more. Had they asked more people for advice, they would be able to see that they were wrong and that the other people were correct. In order to make a correct decision, you need to seek advice and this helps you by giving you more points of view, gives you a higher chance of finding correct advice, and puts math on your side. So next time you need advice, ask multiple people their decision, this will drastically improve the outcome of your decision.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
7A532625FFDC,"Have you ever been so uneasy with your choice that you've even question yourself or at the most ask some one else about it. For example you've ran into a question that you couldn't exactly make your mind up, so you go to a friend or a family member and ask for their advice. Well this all ties into asking others for their opinions or helping you make a better choice then what you originally going pick or decide to go with.

It's good to have multiple opinions, why? You may ask, because somethings need to be heard by other people who care and possible can lead you to the right direction from the choice that you were going to make in the first place. Some opinions can just out right be for entertainment purposes, it can also be for very important things that need to be taken very seriously like school, work places, and many more.

You should always seek another persons point of view or even advice because sometimes they may have a very valid point or a reasonable opinion. For example you just got a new book from Target, a lot of your friends have had the same book for a couple of months now and so has your mother. The first person you asked was your mother, you ask, ""I've been wanting to read this new book for months and you're one of the best person to ask since you've just finished reading it."" Your mother replies in a gloomy tone,""To be very honest with you, I did not enjoy the book that much. The plot was very confusing and I also didn't understand the theme of the book that well."" The next day you go to school and you ask your best friend Generic_Name, "" I need your opinion on the book

Drama that I just got."" Generic_Name answered with excitement, ""It was a very interesting book, i'd read it a million times if I could. Every detail in the book was absolutely amazing, the pictures that were apart of the comic were brightly colored and beautiful."" During lunch you ask for friend Generic_Name how she felt about the book. She politely responded with, ""I didn't find that book as interesting as many people did. It had beautiful pictures but other then that it was kind of boring to be honest with you.""

I used that example because that is a slight way of how a real conversation would go if you really did need a opinion like that. Just be mindful that some people may say very ignorant things that have nothing to do with anything that you asked them about.      ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
A3E66DCF8B6E,"Words of advice are very important in peoples' lives, whether it's a compliment or a motivation to do better. And in times of trouble or desperation, many people find help from more than one person. Seeking for more advice can help people make better choices in their lives because it helps a person find their mistakes and it can increase a person's confidence in difficult situations.

Finding multiple words of advice can help a person find his or her mistakes. For example, if a student didn't do well on an exam, most people, teacher and peers for example, would encourage the student to study harder for the next exam or retake the exam. However, part of finding advice and telling advice takes empathy and a motivation to succeed. Another example includes a system of elimination method, which means that if more people are noticing a person's mistakes, the more likely it is wrong. To conclude, having more people to point-out a person's mistakes through their advice would not only help the person to fix the problem in the future, but would increase the person's confidence and motivation.

Seeking for advice or a motivation can boost a person's confidence especially when difficult problems arise. For example, renound Basketball player Michael Jordan was one of the greatest players in Basketball. However, in his high-school Basketball years, many scouts and universities did not want to recruit him, until the North Carolina Tar Heels coach went to watch his game. In short, even though many greats have been criticized, they never gave up , and they used criticism as an advice for their motivation.

In conclusion, people should seek advice from more people because it helps make better decisions in life and advice builds a person's motivation and confidence through criticism. Criticism and advice takes an understanding of someone elses life, and helps them acheive greater goals and a greater aspiration, and the first step to a person's goal is to encounter his or her mistakes and learn to fix them. Without anyone to criticize someone's game, without anyone to help someone suceed, and without a second chance, then no one would be able to look out for someone's mistakes and point out a better choice, and no one would then be able to suceed in life.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B5BE21756CF7,"Assume you have to decide something, wither its to buy something you like or its which sports team you should play for. Don't you usually ask more than one person? Even if you don't, have you ever thought of why you or someone else would do that? Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can get more background information than just one person can usually provide and the more people you ask the more prepared you will be for any issues that could occur.

Asking more than one person can help you get more background information than just one person will be able to provide. If you ask just one person than their information may be biased and have not as many facts as opinions, but if you ask more than one person than you will have a better chance of getting more facts than opinions. If its about something on the news, social media, and/or its a rumor being spread you can get both/all sides of the story before you form your opinion on that certain topic. Plus if you ask people who have done it before your information will be more accurate than someone will equal experience or less experience than you.

A lot like if you ask more than one person you get more background information, if you do that you also will be more prepared for any issues that may happen. You will be less likely to assume that something will happen if you have heard about it from someone that has had it happened to them. You won't be as surprised if something happens that you didn't expect to happen because like how you won't make assumptions, you will have asked people who have had that happen to them. This doesn't always work because you can spend you whole life building up background information to do something you'll never do it because you are to busy asking people. There is always a happy medium. If you only ask one person then you wont be prepared enough and if you ask to many people then you might never be able to do what you set out to do.

Most people never wonder why they ask more than one person; you probably never did either but the more people you ask the better off you will be. you will be more prepared for any issues than may pop up and you will have more background information that could be necessary to make the decision you wish to make. Even if you asked only two people you will still be more prepared than if you asked just one.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
E6D61167AFFC,"Different people have different mind sets and have faced different things. By asking multiple people about there opinion you can create one based off of their opinions. People have different points of views, there could be two sides of what your discussing. Overall I believe that asking more people about there opinions can help you find the best answer.

There are different point of views for everything. When seeking for an answer, it might now come right away. Asking multiple people gives you more ideas, more time to think, and there could also be two different sides to your answer. There could be ups and downs to your answer but it has to be what fits you the best. You talk to so many people that all have different ideas and opinions, so talking to more and more people could give you more ideas and more opinions.

When seeking an answer you take everything into consideration. Thinking about how different people are all different. No one is the same, this could be used because the more people you talk to the different ideas that you could be told. This could be good or bad because when you talk to multiple people all of there opinions most likely will be different, so when different people tell you different things it could get confusing. You could also look at it you could take all of there opinions and use that to create your own, use their ideas and create a new own that fits best for you.

You could also think of it the other way. You could say that multiple opinions are bad because people are telling you different things and they all tell you something different and that if you talked to one person that it would be better because you would get their opinion and only their opinion. My opinion is to talk to multiple people, I just started golfing and I started off talking to one person about my swing, but now that I have talked to multiple I have now been satisfied by the way I hit the ball and how my swing looks and feels. This is one of my main reason why I chose to ask multiple people.

In my opinion, asking multiple people about their opinions is better than asking one person about theirs. People have different points of views, different sides of whats going on, different things they have faced. Dr. Seuss once said ""The more you learn, the more you know"". I believe that Dr. Guess said this is because the only way you could know more is by communicating to other people about what they know.

It all comes down to what fits the best for you.

6C59EAA45BC1,"Imagine wanting something so badly, but it comes in two different colors of which you both like. Well that's where other people's opinions come into play. I can never make up my mind when I want something, because I always feel like I am going to make the wrong decision. Since I have this issue, I always find it best to ask for other people's advice. So, I can see everyone's point of view. Also, I can hear whether they do or do not enjoy it. Therefore, I will I have options with all the information I have.

First off, I play soccer, and I've been needing a new pair of cleats because my last pair had a whole in them. So, I went to Generic_Name Soccer, the store I purchase my cleats from, to look for a new pair of soccer cleats. Since my last pair was falling apart, I had to leave with a new pair of shoes. I looked at all different styles and colors, and I found a pair of shoes that I loved the colo and style of. So, I tried them on and I thought they were a good fit. At that point, I was ready to check out the shoes. However, I played very well in my last pair of cleats that my mo insisted of me trying on a similar pair. They were the same style shoe as I had, only with newer techonology. The shoes also matched my uniform perfectly, but so did the first ones. Once I had tried on the second pair of shoes, I was stuck. I had no idea what shoes to get, or even know which shoes were better. After sitting in the store for a hour and a half just retrying on the shoes and looking at them, my mom bought both and we asked my family, friends, and looked up reviews on the internet to see which one was prefered. Finally, I chose the pair that I had originally wanted, and my dad returned the other pair a few days later. Without everyone's opinions on the shoes, I wouldn't have been able to chose.

Last summer, I made the decision to leave the shool I've been at since Kindergarten. I went to a private school in Generic_City for about eight years, and so did my sister. She graduated and went to Generic_School in Generic_City. Her school day starts at 7:50 and ends at 2:50. She has to drive about 40 minutes there every moring, and the same on the way home. She's always exhausted and has a ton of homework. So she goes to bed late and has to wake up extremely early Monday through Friday. However, I wasn't sure that I wanted to do the same thing. I didn't want to go into a high school not knowing anyone, so I had strongly considered coming to Generic_School my last year of middle school. After debating all sumer with my parents, discussing the pros and cons ith them, and hearing the benefits from my friends, I decided to come to Generic_School this year. Although it was a tough decision to make, I still believe that I made the right one withbthe help of my family and friends.

For high school, I am undecided of where I am attending. I play travel soccer for Generic_School girls ECNL team. ECNL gives every team that plays this elite level a break in the Spring so they can play for their high school team. My whole team are Freshmans this year. However, one other girl and I are the only ones not yet in high school. Since my sister goes to Generic_School, it would be ideal that I went as well. But soccer is very important to me. I have played since I was three years old and I plan to continue. Generic_School is a private school, so their girls soccer season is in the Fall. However, ECNL doesn't take off time in the fall. They take off time in the Spring. So, I would have double practices everyday in the Fall. and have barely any practice for a team in the Spring. But if I went to public school, I would have the same schedule as everyone else. I am stil undecided, but I am waiting to hear from my teammates, coaches, family, and friends to hear their opionions on this important topic and whether they liked itor not.

I value other people's opinions, because sometimes I have trouble making choices. It helps when I can hear everyone's thoughts and ideas on the topic. Also, to see what my older friends, who have similar taste to me, recommend and don't recommend helps. Since I have choices, it makes me put more thought into each decison that I make. Sometimes I need other people's perspertive on certain things to help me make up my mind.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
DEE347FC135C,"Have you ever been in a situation where you don't know what to do? So of course, like any other person would when they are in need of assistance, you ask somebody else about their take on the situation. And you may be thinking to yourself

"" Well one other opinion is all I need "" right?, WRONG! There are tons of reasons why getting numerous opinions is a lot more helpful then if you didn't.

One reason why I believe it is important to seek multiple opinions is because everyone is unique and has their own point of views. Talking to someone who has had to deal with the same situation you're in can help tons when coming to obtaining advice. For example if you want to pursue your dream as a film maker you're obviously gonna want to go to someone who has experience and interest in making films, where as if you go to someone who has no interest or knowledge at all you're gonna get a totally different response because not everybody sees things in the same way.

Another reason why it is important to seek multiple opinions is because some people can have a very heavy bias on certain subjects. Picture this, you're thinking about going out and doing something so you decide to ask a friend what they think about it. They so happen to have a bad experience with it so obviously their opinion on it is not going to be a very good one because they have a bias. Just because somebody else had a bad experience doesn't necessarily mean it will go that way for you, but also same thing goes for a good experience someone else may have had.

And finally a last reason why it is very important to seek multiple opinions is because it will help you see all the pros and cons surrounding your idea. Of course its easy to talk to people who think just like you because you will both have the same beliefs and can both also agree and many things, but sometimes that's not always the best idea. Communicating with somebody who has a different perspective can be just as useful if not maybe even more. This is allowing you to see things from totally different points of view which well help you see the pros and cons that you may not have even realized before.

In conclusion the best thing to do when you're in need of advice, seeking multiple opinions is the way to go. It will allow you to see from different point of views that you yourself might have never even thought of.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C2A6C69714EC,"When you ask someone for advice on something do you try to get a second opinion? Well if you have not I bet not getting multiple opinions is not the best choice to make because its smarter to get multiple. Say even if the other opinions are not something you would want or do it is still smart to get because they could help but they wouldn't effect you if they do not help. so why not get the second or maybe third opinion on something it will only help. Some reasons you should find a second opinion on something are that you are getting multiple different people who have different experiences and opinions so you have many to choose from, if the first person gave you bad or false info getting a second opinion could help, and if you are playing a sport and your getting a doctors opinion on an injury getting a second opinion could keep you playing or help you big.

The first thing I will talk about is how getting multiple opinions gives you lots of things to choose from. If you just get one opinion on something then you are only have one thing to go off of but if you have multiple than you can choose which one you think is best. This means a lot because the first opinion might not always be the best one for you. So go and get that second,third or maybe fourth opinion it won't hurt it will only help and you have many different people with different experiences in there life to help you. For example you could ask someone who dose not have much experience in what your asking but then if you get a second opinion they could help you because maybe they have had experience with it sometime in there life. So if you would have just got the one opinion it might not have turned out good as it would if you got that second opinion. So just getting one opinion may not be the best choice.

Next lets talk about how you could get false or bad information from someone so getting a second opinion could help. Well not everyone you ask could have the right information, some could be telling false or just bad information. So getting other opinions could come in big for you if the first opinion was not very good. For example if you are trying to get a opinion on what you should buy a family member for a gift and you only get one opinion and they say that the person likes something but they really don't then that could be pretty bad for you. I don't think you would be to pleased either if that happened so just get a second opinion so everyone can be happy. Also sometimes the opinion could just be really bad and not help you at all. So do your self a favor and get multiple opinions.

Finally I will finish off with what i think has the most impact on someone which is if you play a sport then getting a second opinion is huge especially if it deals with an injury. When athletes get injured they get an opinion from the doctor if they think they should get surgery or whatever and most of them go to other doctors for more opinions to find there best option. This helps them a lot because some doctors could say they need surgery but then others they go to could say that they won't need surgery and that they just need rest or physical therapy or something. sometimes the doctors will even say they might need career ending surgery but another doctor says that he can still play after a surgery he just need to recover. As you can expect that other opinion helps big time for them so they won't have to possibly end there career. Or it could be the other way around that one doctor says he dose not need surgery but other doctors do then he should go with surgery so whatever is hurting does not get worse and force him to stop playing. For example a couple of weeks ago there was this pitcher in baseball that got injured and was going to doctors to see if he was okay one doctor said he would need Tommy John surgery which usually puts you out for a whole season and he didn't want that so he went to two other doctors who both said he wouldn't need it so that saved him from missing a entire season which helps him a lot.

Now

I will conclude my reasons on why people should seek multiple opinions to help them later on. So as you can tell after reading this finding more opinions is very helpful and could change your life in some ways. However this does not mean that every first opinion you get is wrong it just means that it dose not hurt to have multiple opinions to choose from. Like I said in sports and In basically anything in life it helps because you will always have choices to make and getting more opinions might just come up big for you. After going over my essay of why you should get multiple opinions then I hope you consider seeking more than one opinion next time you need an opinion on something.            ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

Having multiple opinions can help make better choices because you can figure out which would be the best for the situation and it can give you back up ideas in case one goes wrong and you need another also it can show how your friends can contribute by giving you there best ideas.

First thing is that getting multiple ideas help in case if one of them fail you have more to rely on. Like if you were going to write an essay and you didnt know what hook you wanted to write, so you ask a friend on which one you should use. You decide to use the first friends idea but it wasnt right for the essay, but luckily you have another one that a friend gave you that could fit better in the essay.

Second thing is that you can list pros and cons on which idea would be better for the situation. Like say someone asked you out and a friend gives you advice you like but another friend gives you better advice you like more. List pros and cons and make sure you choose one that will fit the situation better. Even if you like the other ne more it still might not fit the situation better.

Last thing is that it can show how your friends care about you. It can show that they really want to help you and give you there best opinions. Its letting you know that you can trust someone to give you there best advice that they have.

When you ask several people on what you should do when you have problem it gives you a better idea on what the right thing to do is. This can be confusing though because someone might have a complete opposite answer as the other person you ask. When this happens it's good to find a middle ground on what would be the best thing to do. If you just ask one person for help on something or advice and they give you an answer sometimes you aren't happy with it or you need more, that's when it's good to ask maybe someone else.

Say that you needed help on a math homework question and you ask you mom and she tries to help but maybe the answer seems a little off. Then you remember you have a sibling that is closer to your grade and might have a better way of solving the math problem. This is a good way to help you be satisfied with your answer. You asked your mom which had a good way of solving you math problem but also you sister helped you find the answer. This way you feel more confident in your answer.

It's good to ask other people for advice on what to do because maybe one person of the three people you asked had experience in what your going through and would help you better because it happened to them also. Say someone in your friend group got mad at another friend of your and your stuck in the middle and you ask one of your friends for help but that has never happened to them and they really don't know what to say. So then maybe you can ask a family member like a cousin and the same thing happened to them she can help you more. If you have only asked that one person you probably would have not made a very smart decision but since you asked other people it was more helpful. Never be afraid to ask someone for help because you may never know in how many ways different people can help you in a situation.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
9550CC8FE928,"Asking for more gets you more. If you ask for advice than you need more than one mind . For example If you work together you can get what you seek for. Asking for advice has more wisdom in it, and the more information the better the advice. Without asking you can not get a lot of things done in life. There are so many ways to get what you want the more you put effort in the better the results will be.

To add on to get the best advice you need to work together and because of that you can get the wisest and smartest advice. Working together gets a lot of things accomplished you can learn a lot form each other and your group can fix your mistakes. Working together is more effect than working by your self, because some people have more wisdom or some people are smarter and all combine you can get the best advice. Seeking for advice from people is like reading books the more books you read the more knowledge you get. If you do not ask people or work together than you will be lost in life for example when you go some were new and if you are lost you can ask people were the directions are. Thats the same thing with asking others for advice.

Also one thing is that wisdom can make a lot of things better in life. It can help you with more than you wish for, another thing is that the more wisdom the better the results will be. Asking people for advice can give you a lot of wisdom and the more you ask the more your advice will be. Wisdom is a key in life just by saying a couple of words can give a lot of influences thats why its important to talk to others so the advice they give to you can be better than the one you made.

Another thing is without information you can not get simple things done in life, but with a lot of information than you can get a lot of things done in life. Talking to more than one person is better, the reason why is because you are seeking advice and you are also getting more information. With a lot of information the advice will become better because than the advice will have some knowledge in it. When you do something wrong and you can fix it and then you will learn from it which will get you information. Same thing with people all over the world they make mistakes and they fix it. So in conclusion the people who have done a lot of things in there lives are the smartest ones with the best advice to give out. One thing is that books and humans are similar. You can't know the information without opening the book or talking to the person, sometimes it might be good or it might be horrible, but the more you go through the more infromation/advices you will get.

To sum it all up talking to more than one person is better than doing it alone. The more people the more knowledge the more knowledge the more wisdom. Talking to more than one person is helpful when you are stuck on something you can ask others for help or when you are buying something you can ask others which one is the best choice and then you can learn from that person. Having wisdom in life helps a lot, and to have wisdom you must have information from others by asking. I believe that asking more than one person can be really helpful in life you can learn a lot from it and get to know more people and asking is a cycle of life you will end up helping someone like you in the future. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
FBBA8C2C378A,"I think if you go to more than one person for advice it can help you a lot more. I think that because if only one person tells you something it doesn't mean very much, but if multiple people give you the same advice then you know more people would choose that too. If one person tells you to do something but 10 others tell you not to do it you're more likely to listen to what the 10 people say instead. Me personally i think it helps to ask more than one person too see what everyone else thinks because people think way different than eachother so most of them are going to have something else to say. When just one person gives you advice they could have to clue what they're talking about and you would probably think they're right because its the only person you have asked. So moral of the story make sure before you do something ask multiple people for advice not just one person! It will really help more than you think it will.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
C1F1332EAAE1,"When I was a little girl my mom always used to say this quote ""

Never trust just one person

"". I never could really understand the meaning behind this quote, till a event in my life changed everything. Were I ended up getting hurt because of the advice one person gave to me. This quote means even if you trust one person with everything always ask for a second opinion. When one is trying to get good advice ask more then one person your able to see all the outcomes, find what works best for you, and sometime people just tell you thing to benefit them self.

When a person has a problem it is good to know all of the out comes as a result of what will happen. Consulting in more them one person your able to get different ways to fix the situation. Sure you may think you only need one person to help you get through everything but what happens if there opinion gets you in a lot of trouble. What is one going to do from there if you dont ask others for what they think. For example if you robed a bank, you ask your best friend what they would do they say keep the money and when you get caught you would get in big trouble. If you ask someone else like your parents they would say just tell the truth and not get in as much trouble. There are always more then one solution also it depend on who gives you the advice.

When asking more then one for what they think is best your able to find what best fits for you. Wouldn't you want to solve the problem with out getting as hurt or in trouble. We all know that there is always a easy way out but is it the best option. Seeking multiple opinions will give you the chance to find

For a instance you got in a fight with your best friend, so you go ask your other friends what to do one said make it up and others say make her say sorry first. After hearing this sure making her say sorry is easier but is it the right way to go. Its always better to just find what you think is right even if it is a little harder.

In this word we live in today one day your best friend can say ""omg we will be friend forever"" but at the end they say things to you that only benefit them self. Have this ever happen to you? It happened to me before, when I was little I was best friends with this girl. I asked her what her opinion on what I should were to the school dance, she told me to get this really ugly dress because of that i got laughed at and she be came popular. If I asked someone else I am pretty sure I wouldn't have been humiliated. In the 20 first century most people now only care for there well being and not anyone else.

Looking for the right answers maybe hard sometimes, you maybe not like the outcome. Even if you think that one people knows the answer just to make sure get others opinions on it. Dont be scared to ask what is the worst that can happen. At the end just do what you believe is right, peoples opinions are what they think it is only suppose to help guide but you have to make the final decision  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F348B69F4341,"Have you ever needed advice for something and went to your older sibling or one of your parents? Studies show that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. You should always ask more than one person for advice because the one person you ask may not know as much about the topic as someone else might. For example, if you ask your brother or sister for advice on how to pay taxes, they may not have as much wisdom as your mom and your dad do. On the other hand if you ask your mom or dad for advice on what brands are in style right now, she may not know as much as your brother or sister would. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because someone else might have more knowledge on the topic, they might not have as much wisdom as someone else, and they may be too old or too young for them to give you good advice.

The first reason why you should always ask more than one person for advice when seeking it is because someone else might have more knowledge on the topic. Say that you need to know how to do a math problem. If you go home and only ask your mom how to do it she might not be totally sure how to do it and you might get the problem wrong. Therefore you would be better of asking a few people in your math class how to do it. That is why you should ask people for advice that have knowledge on the topic.

The next reason why you should always ask more than one person for advice when seeking it is because they might not have as much wisdom as someone else. When you get older and need to know how to do taxes you should ask both of your parents not your siblings. Again if you ask your brother or sister for advice on how to pay taxes, they won't have as much wisdom as your mom and dad would. That is why you should ask people with wisdom if you need advice.

The final reason why you should ask more than one person for advice when seeking it is because they might be too old or too young to give you good advice. Going back to the clothing thing, if you need to know what brands are in style you shouldn't ask your parents because they might be too old to know. You also shouldn't ask your younger siblings because they may be too young to know. Therefore you should ask one of your older siblings or maybe even one of your friends. That is why you should ask people that are the appropriate age for advice.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because someone else might have more knowledge on the topic, they might not have as much wisdom as someone else, and they may be too old or too young for them to give you good advice. Those are all great reasons supporting why you should always seek multiple opinions when asking for advice. All of these things can help you make a better choice. That is why you should always seek multiple opinions when asking for advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EAF1A1E138E8,"Have you ever wondered why you ask someone for advice, and then usually ask another peer the same question? I believe that there are many valuable reasons for that, and I'm going to tell you everything I know and think about this topic. Everyone can have completely different opinions on things like this, so my goal is to put every bit of mine into this paper, and attempt to change yours.

I strongly believe that asking for advice from multiple people is a good idea, but sometimes asking too many people can be more stressful to you. So, I came up with a few things to describe my reasoning. Although, I couldn't help but to start with this reason, different opinions. Almost every person you ask will have a semi-different answer and that's just how things work. But if you ask too many people, your brain can take all the data you collected and make it a little harder to choose if your choice is the smartest one. I'd say if you want to ask a certain amount of people, it would be anywhere from two to four. When you ask fewer people, you can think about your answers you got back and decide whos answer was best, without having ten different ones to choose from.

Some people you ask may be bad influences, which would be why two of your answers were positive but the other one was more towards the negative side of things. Trust is another very important part of all this because if you don't trust a certain person, they may lie and leave you with a bad decision. This also ties into why you should always ask at least one other person. Adults vs kids! nine out of ten times a kid will have a different answer that an adult, so asking both won't hurt, and will let you know if an adult would appreciate your decision.

Most of the time people use this method to get a better understanding of the question. I put every opinion into my writing and I hope now you will use some of these things when having to make an important decision, and want to tell your peer. Don't be too scared about asking for advice, but always be cautious on who, or how many people you ask. Which brings me to my finial question. Do you now know why you ask someone for advice, and usually ask multiple people as well?                        ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
FA043D2FAA3C,"When you are faced with a decision, how do you go about making that decision? Many people ask others for their opinion and what they would do. This is a great strategy because, if you only ask one person they'll probably give you their opinion based only on their life experience, you can make the decision that the majority of people would have suggested, and some of the people will help you see from a different perspective what the decision actually is and how it will effect the rest of your life. These people can be very helpful in decision making.

The first reason that seeking multiple opinions can help you make the right choice is that, if you just base your decision off of one person, that person will probably be advising you in making that decision based on a life situation that they have been in that either effected how they made that decision or would effect the outcome of what they eventually decided to do. This can be bad because you might not be in the same situation as that person was in when they made the choice that they did. Also, that person doesn't know what you are going through and what this decision has in store for you. When you act off one persons opinion, the choice that they made might have led them down a good path, but, even if you make that same choice, there might be something different that's waiting at the end of that same path for you. So, when you take their advice and make the same choice that they did, keep in mind that it can negatively effect you afterwards or during the decision-making process, or it can leave you in a different situation than it did them.

Next, if you get multiple opinions you have the opportunity to do what the majority of people have chosen or would chose to do. Many people do this, and it can be quite helpful. People will often do this because they assume that most people will make the right choice when faced with a decision. There is also the fact that, if the people that made a certain choice seem as though they are in a good place in life and that their life isn't terrible because they made that choice, that is the choice that most people will make and the path that most people will take. In addition to this, most people feel that if they make the choice that other people did and those people got a good result out of it, that is the decision that should be made because people want to get what they think is the best possible outcome for them in general, and when faced with a decision.

Finally, when you get multiple opinions the people that give those opinions will sometimes also give you advice and help you find a new perspective on what the decision and the choices actually are and what they really mean. This can be very helpful because if you don't look into your future at what each of the possible paths can lead you to, you could make the decision and realize that the situation you would end up in is a terrible place to be in life, or you could look into your future with the help of the people around you, and make the choice that would put you in a good place afterwards. Also, if you aren't paying much attention to what you are actually about to do, you might not realize that the situation at hand is going to effect you way more than you let on. This can be very bad because, like what was previously stated, this can put you in a very bad place in life. Additionally, if you find multiple opinions on the situation those people can help you depict the question that is being asked of you and the possible choices that could be made and where they would put or leave you, so that you know what is really being asked of you and don't make the decision blindly.

In conclusion, there are many reasons that people would look for multiple opinions while making a decision. Namely, if you base your decision off of one person you might make a choice based off the situation that person was in when or if they were faced with that choice, you can take the most abundant response because the people that responded with that might be in a better place in life than the people who made different choices, and lastly, the people you ask can help you find another point of view on the situation to help you better understand the decision that is being or need to be made.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
EC591630ED15,"The fire tripled in size, and it had reached my ceiling before I knew it my whole kitchen was on fire. Here how it happened, I had asked my friend for advice on what should I do if the oil catches on fire. He told me to just pour water on it. The oil caught on fire, and I poured water on it, and you can guess what had happened, the fire tripled in size. Everyone agrees that we should always ask more than one person for advice, but sadly not everyone does it, and it can have daring consequences. I say that everyone should ask more than one person for advice because, it gives then more of a better understanding on the idea, you can see if someone is incorrect about the advice they gave you, and it is usually safer and better in general to ask for advice.

Asking more than one person for advice can give you a better understanding on the idea you are asking about, and it you can learn more. Lets say that for an example, you were asking about how to make your computer faster, and you learned new things about how a computer and how the parts of a computer work. For another example, you wanted to change your cars oil, but forgot which tube is the oil one. I ask someone for advice and know you know where the water or the liquid cooler goes just in case your car breaks down. For instance, you wanted to know where to put commas, so you ask for advice and after a couple of tries you now know where periods go instead of putting commas there. That is why it is better to ask more than one person for advice, because you can get a better understand of the idea and learn more.

Asking more than one person for advice is much better than just asking one person, because you can see if they are incorrect or not. For an example, I asked ten people if I can use eggs that have only been expired for a day. Everyone said no it is expired do not use it, except for one person who said it is okay to use, I was able to see that the one person that said it was okay most likely incorrect. For another instance, I asked my four of my friends if the mall is closed today, three of them said it is not closed, but one person said it is not closed yet. I can see that the person who said the mall is not closed yet is most likely wrong. Furthermore, I was not able to decide which car faster, so I can buy it for the race that is in two months, so I asked six of my friends for advice about which car is faster the BMW or Mercedes. five of them said the BMW but one of them said the Mercedes is faster, so that most likely means that the person who said the Mercedes is faster is incorrect.

Asking some people for advice instead of one person is better, because it is safer. For an example, I went to the doctor to see if I was sick, but the doctor said I was not sick, but I had showed symptoms of being sick, so I went to see two other doctors, and they both said I was sick, and I really was sick. For another instance, we were hiking in the woods when a venomous snake bite me. I urgently asked all of my friends for advice, one of my friends quickly advised me to suck the venom out, but the rest of my friends stopped me from doing it, and instead they put a really tight bandage around my leg. Now instead of losing my life I survived, because I had asked more than one person for advice. For the last example, I was modding a car, and I was going to buy a fake part, so I asked four of my friends about it. Three of my friends said do not buy it can make your car catch on fire, but one of my friends said it was okay. I did some research online and I had found out that the fake car part can actually make your car on fire.

Whoosh, the fire had tripled in size, and the whole kitchen had almost burned down. That all happened because I had asked only one person for advice instead of two or three or more. Before you do anything and you do not know exactly what to do, ask more than one person for advice it will be worth it in the long run. Asking more than one person for advice is much better because. you can get a better understanding of the idea and learn more, you can see who is incorrect, and it is much safer. That is why I state to always ask more than one person for advice.                          ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
3351F137568E,"Your opinion could mean a lot to someone. Why do you think seeking multiple people for opinions helps you make a better choice ? Getting more than one opinion is good because someone could have probably had the same choice you had to make in life , or maybe one person could know a lot about what you are going threw.

Dont you think people are going or have been threw your problem to ? There are definitely people with the same problem as you or people that could have been threw the same problem as you but know a lot about it thats why you should always ask more than one person for their opinions about a choice that you are going to make. if you were to just ask one person about a choice you are going to make without other people knowing what choice you are going to choose it could either turn out bad.

I remember when my friend was thinking about which NBA player to get in 2k20. He had the option of a 99 overall Kobe Bryant , or 99 overall Micheal Jordan. So then we started discussing it with another friend that I called about and then we all brought up ideas on how one was better than the other and then we came to a decision , we all thought that Micheal would be better so we told him to get him and he did. At the end it was a good choice.

Thats why should always ask more than one person about a choice you are going to make. Asking more people could make you change your mind on one of the choices you have already chosen. The amount of people you talk to about your choice could have a big impact on which one you choose.

646500FB5CD3,"Have you ever needed advice? Well as it turns out, a bunch of people as have asked for advice. People should seek out multiple opinions when asking for advice because it gives you different views, it can help you think it out, and it opens up more options.

When you ask for advice, you may want different views. First, if you ask just one person, you only have their view on the topic. Only having one person's view doesn't really help you out a bunch. Also, when you have different views, it helps lead you to the correct way. The more views you have, the more it helps you out. Lastly, talking to multiple people helps you find the best choice that suits you. Sometimes someone's view may not suit you well, so asking multiple people can help you find the one that suits you the best. These are some reasons why having different views helps you when your asking for advice.

Most of the time, you need to think the topic out, so getting multiple opinions can help you do just that. First, when you ask a bunch of people their opinions, it can help you think out the topic. When you can think stuff out, it can help you a bunch. Also, when you ask only one person, it can be harder for you to think the topic out. The easier it is to think out, the easier it is to find the best choice for you. Lastly, some people needs to take time to think things out before deciding on what their going to do. Those people should seek out multiple opinions to help them decide what their going to do. These are some reason how seeking out multiple opinions can help you think the topic out.

The final reason is that when you ask more people, it opens up more options to pick from. First, when you ask multiple people, it opens up more options. Sometimes when you ask for advice the might give you something you didn't think of. Also, hearing more options can help you. It is a lot easier to pick from a bunch of options instead of just 2 or 3. Lastly, most of the time, not having multiple options can lead to the person picking a not so great option. The more options you have, the more likely you are to pick a great one. These are some reasons why having more options can help people when asking for advice.

People should seek out multiple opinions when asking for advice. It can give you different views, it can help you think the topic out, and it opens up more options to pick from.

5ECB2C9552EF,"When people ask for advice, some people talk to more than just one person to have a better choice . There purpose is to have multiple opinions so it is easier to make your choice based on the opinions. When you ask only one person, they will tell you the way they went, and it worked out great for them. When you ask other people, they will tell you their story, and you will get an honest opinion on what would work for you. People ask for advice from other people is to: Have more opinions, use those opinions and move them around, like a puzzle, and find out which one is best for you, not everybody else.

One reason is to have more opinions. People use more opinions to to filter them out. They have all these opinions, maybe they are all the same, maybe none of them are the same. Most people you want advice from, care about you and want to watch you succeed. There is another good thing about asking for more than one opinion.

Another reason is to sort those opinions out and move them around. When you have like seven or eight opinions, it is hard to use all eight of them. Sometimes you can smush all of your opinions into one. Other times, you can take out a part of the opinions and put them together and if you like it you keep it, if not take out other parts of it. One more reason for having mutiple people giving you advice.

The last reason is find out which one is right for you, not everybody else. If you need some advice, and you go to people, they will give you some advice. If you go to other people and you like their advice better, you don't use the person that gave the worse advice just because you like them, go with your gut. And when they ask you why they didn't use their advice, just tell them that you found better advice. These were the reasons to have other peoples advice.

Ultimately, you pick a lot of people to have a better outcome for your decision. When you ask other people, they will tell you their story, and you will get an honest opinion on what would work for you.

56774BA72B7B,"The best choice. When I was younger I never bothered to ask for other opinions. It was only because I thought that I was always right. When I was around the age of eight it was around my Birthday. So my grandpa asked me what I wanted because he was gonna take me to get something after school. During school as soon as I walked in I asked my friends what I should get it was between an xbox or a guitar. Multiple people came upon me during the day saying ''xbox get the xbox''. Later in the school day I had someone else tell me to get the guitar because a guitar is long lasting not a stupid xbox so i agreed. When I got home I told my grandpa that I wanted a guitar. Three minutes after me telling him what I wanted he got ready and we went to the music store. I got a black and white electric guitar with an amplifier and a case.

Getting peoples opinion on something is good for anything. Opinions might not be a fact but it can still help. Its helpful because when your getting a new car wouldnt you want someone else s perspective on the car you intended on buying. Majority of the time when people buy cars or a house someone or something might change your mind. My mom was gonna buy a ford when I was like eight but the sales man told my mom that the Volks wagon is a way safer family car, and was cheaper. So my mom obviously used the workers opinion and didnt go with the ford we came out with a foreign 2014 Volks Wagon.

Opinions are commonly used around schools. Like when your having a debate lesson you need other opinions. If your going to court you need others opinions on what they think you did wrong so called the jury. If we didnt have opinions we'd all be knee deep in chaos. Opinions is what keeps the right and wrong balanced if you dont think about others opinion you are just self considerate. You dont like to here what others have to say i'm not saying its a bad thing its just not a good thing. Opinions are what make up the bad things every time we get a new elected president somebody has to bring up something bad about them. For instance Donald. J.Trump. they would always be on his case because he married to somebody whos fifth teen years older then her. They always say bad stuff about the Iranian incident but they never think of any one else's opinion.

Getting others opinions on something can lead to something better because, some people like when theres a better answer or something. Like for instance when I asked for my school mates opinion on weither I get a guitar or an xbox it turned out great I went with everyone opinion and got the one everyone else liked. I still have the guitar to this day and its been what six or seven years so far. If I got the Xbox It would've probably been old and dusty by now but the guitar is clean no lint, no dirt, and no dust. Its sitting on the guitar stand I asked my mom for on my birthday. Ever since my Grandpa passed away and my grandma the guitar is the last true thing I have to remember them by. I look at it everyday when I get out of bed just sitting on the guitar stand like its a dog in a dog bed. Overtime I look at it I see my grandma and grandpa. Every time he called he would ask if I learned any new songs and I told him I was writing a song that he never got to hear. It just amazing on how opinions can help you solve many things.

Opinions helped me deal with the passing of my grandparents. I always wanted to cry and die but my friends told me their opinion on why I should'nt now I have to live with the satisfaction that I have people that care for me. Thats is why opinion is a great thing its helped me make many great choices in life and I wont forget them.

Her friends are giving her mixed opinions, between staying here with them or following her dreams. Her family is telling her that she should take the job. The CEO of the company is begging for her to join them. She is extremely confused and doesn't know what to do. Asking many people for advice gives her a better platform for making her decision. If she had just asked for one opinion, she might have listened to it without hearing the other side. Getting advice from various individuals can help an individual get different opinions, see the pros and cons of each side, and also boost the chance that they see which choice is the best. When asking people for advice, it is better to seek multiple opinions in order to make the better choice.

Sometimes, when making a difficult decision, people are blind sighted and can not see all the possibilities at once. When first introduced to the decision, it is easy to just think of one obvious solution and go with it, but asking different people for their opinion can help create new ways to go about that decision. A couple years ago, my family and I were staying at an AirBnB on the beautiful main island of Puerto Rico. We were scheduled to depart for San Juan the next day, and then come back to the main island. However, we did not book anywhere to stay the night that we would come back. My mother frantically searched for unreserved hotels and AirBnBs, but nothing was available. After an hour of utter chaos, I asked Generic_Name, the owner of the AirBnB, suggestions on where we could stay. She said that we were more than welcome to stay at her place again, since it was not filled yet. If we did not decide to ask her about our dilemma, we might have ended up sleeping on a beach! More people being asked for advice causes more solutions to be unlocked.

After seeing all of the different decisions, it is helpful to consider every single one and what the impact of it would be. Someone might think that their decision of closing a grocery store is a great idea and will help the traffic flow better, but after talking to their peers, they might see that this idea could leave many people without a primary source of food. Not only does seeking multiple opinions help an individual eliminate bad ideas, but it can also help that person weigh the pros and cons of each idea. Although nothing is perfect, with a close examination of each choice, the different ways to go about the decision can be narrowed down to a couple efficient solutions. As Albert Einstein once said, ""You will never know your lives fullest potential unless you consider all sides to every decision."" Asking various people for their input on a decision can help highlight the advantages and disadvantages of making one choice versus another.

Seeing the negatives and positive ultimately leads to making the better choice. If a person asks 20 people for advice, there would be a higher chance of them making the best decision rather than if they only asked two people. A study conducted at the University of Ohio began with two 15 year old boys. Both of them were given the same decision to make, but one of them was allowed to seek advice from others, while the other one wasn't. The decision they had to make was whether schools should incorporate healthier foods into their cafeteria. The first boy, who was allowed to ask others for their opinion, argued that schools should add healthier foods because it creates good eating habits, lowers the amount of unhealthy students, and gives students a chance to make better choices. However, the boy who didn't have the chance to ask for outside opinions stated that schools should not bring in healthier food because it does not taste as good as junk food. After this experiment was done repeatedly with different students, the university concluded that 95% of the time, the student who asked for advice made the better decision. This experiment highlights the advantages of asking for advice from others, since it helps people see the best choice under their circumstances.

Although there is never a clear-cut answer to every problem, asking multiple people for advice can make the right choice a bit more obvious. Listening to others gives different opinions on the matter, weighs the advantages and disadvantages of each opinion, and also bolsters the chance of making the best decision easier to see. As Barack Obama always preaches, ""You are never alone in life, so why isolate yourself? The people surrounding you want to help you, so let them.""",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
16206760663F,"Seeking advice is a common thing. People ask their friends and family for advice. They also have to go to other people, like co-workers or classmates, to get another opinion. They need all the opinions they can get to make a decision. They can need a opinion for socializing, like if they want to go to a movie, or go to a restaurant. Advice and opinions is how you can make that decision.

When someone asks their people for advice, they trust that person. Friends can be trusted to give their opinion to you. It can be a good or bad opinion, but they are giving help and advice to the people who need it. Friends have to be trusted, or they aren't your friend at all. If you know they can't be trusted, ask for advice somewhere else.

Another place where people can be trusted is your family. Family can be the best place to get advice from. They will be helpful in any way. That shows that they care for you. Their opinion can be the best help or advice you can get. Family are straight-up with you. They don't lie to your face if you ask for advice, they give you all you need to make that choice. If you need help at school or mental and psychological health, family is the place you go to.

Trusted adults are another group that you can get help from. Trusted adults can be policemen or women, your teachers, or the school councilors. You can get help from them anytime. If you need help with your family, school, or yourself, they can help you and give you advice what to do.

Advice is a factor in your decision. You need an opinion to help you make your choice. Getting advice from people means that you trust them. Trust them for future decisions. Ask more people for their opinion. You can also improve your talking skills and also give advice to the people that need it, so you can everyone make the right decisions. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
2F852F042CE6,"Have you ever asked for advice? If you answered yes, did you ask more than one person? Well I'll tell why it's important to ask more than one person for advice. There are many advantages for asking more people they can have a different point of view, and you can trust the act more because there can be more people saying the same thing.

Asking multiple people for advice will give you different opinions and options. Different point of views allows you to have a second opinion. This could be asking both your mom and your dad, and they could help you pick out your shoes if you can't decide between the ""Kyrie 6 Pre-Heat New York City"" and the ""KD 12 All-Star Don-C"". Asking more than one person gives you different paths to take and gives more opportunities. Different people have different tastes from vacation spots to what sports they like to play. An addition to that, there personalities come in play as well. If they are given a task they could have different ways on completing it.

The next reason is trusting the opinion more. If there are more people that have the same idea you will trust it more. If you ask more people the more options you will get, and some of them could overlap and be connected. Majority is a big part in making a choice it can pressure you in a good way and a bad way. For example if you do not have enough money to buy somethings yo can be pressured to steel it. Instead an alternative option is to talk to your mom or a trusted adult about it before steeling. I think you should talk about it and ask before you act because it can clear up some misconceptions and help you make a better choice.

To finish it up these are some big ways that seeking multiple opinions can help. You can get more opinions on your idea and make a better choice. This is why getting multiple opinions is benifitical.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F59DDBF5DB0B,"Have you ever wondered why so many people in this world have made such incredible decisions? Well its because they asked many individuals around them for their points of views. So many people in this world have depended on others beliefs because in order to succeed you must to be open to new thoughts. For example Donald Trump the U.S President listens to his citizens opinions in order to move forward and improve on situations. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because individuals opinions can impact or expand yours and that different points lead to different ways of thinking.

Individuals opinions can impact and expand yours because they can give you tips on how to improve on your thoughts and choices. Talking to someone who has a different thinking than you is always a good person to ask for advice. They might give you a way to look at your situation with a new a set of eyes. There is always room for expanding and opening your mind to new ideas so you can lead to different ways of thinking.

Different views can lead to different ways of thinking. Different for different individuals will make you think differently about certain situations. Views from other people will affect and may likely improve your beliefs for that situation or problem. Thats why its important to sometimes depend of the opinions on others because it can improve your well being. So that is why its always good to continue to listen to and take in others advice,views, and opinions.

After reading this essay talk to multiple people about a problem or a situation your facing. Ask yourself ""am I taking in this information and using it to improve myself"". Although, do not let others make your own decision take in their opinions and use that to make your own choice. Remember. Even though you are asking others to make a choice when it all comes down the only that matters is your own.                    ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
03036B87A396,"Decisions are sometimes tricky or difficult to make and often leave us with doubt or uneasiness. In these situations, seeking the opinions of others can help us make a better choice. An opinion other than your own can be refreshing as well as reassuring. Someone else may see an outcome you disregarded, positive and or negative. In addition, the advice you receive from others provides you with wisdom and a new approach to attacking obstacles.

Sometimes, we have to make tough decisions and there are a myriad of right and wrong answers. In those circumstances, turning to a family member or friend to hear their opinion is refreshing and most importantly reassuring. When faced with a decision like choosing what cereal to eat for breakfast, we don't think twice about it or consult anyone else but ourselves. This is because it is a simple decision that requires simple thinking. However, when faced with a tougher decision like deciding what college your going to, a decision that could change your life, it is too stressful for most people to fathom on their own. In situations like that, talking to family members and friends about the decision you have to make and hearing their opinion, is reassuring and calming. This is because it opens your eyes to all the possibilities and outcomes of that decision.

With all decisions, there are outcomes, or the result of that decision. These ""outcomes"" can be positive or negative. When pressed with hard decisions, consulting a peer, friend, or family member can better your decision because they might foresee a possible outcome of that decision you may have disregarded. According to a survey done by psychologists at Stanford University, 78% of people they surveyed admit that the decision they most regret, is one they made on their own. People are not fortune tellers, they can't predict everything that will happen, how it will happen, and when it will happen. This is why it helps to hear others opinions, because they might see what you don't. Dr. Benson, a Psychologist at MIT once quoted ""Everyones brain is like a snowflake, each different from one another."" This quote simply put, is an explanation for why seeking opinions from others, can open your eyes to outcomes you may have disregarded, and it's because everyones brain and thinking process is different.

Furthermore, the help you receive from others to make decisions, can provide you with wisdom and even change your approach to attacking obstacles you encounter. All people think differently and react differently to what life throws at them. When you attack a problem sometimes you get stuck, frustrated, and upset. This is when the advice of others would be helpful. The wisdom they provide for you (if any) might carry on to you and you may find yourself with a more efficient way of approaching, assessing, and taking on obstacles.

To conclude, it is always helpful to hear the opinions of others. This is because an opinion other than your own can be refreshing as well as reassuring. Someone else may see an outcome you disregarded, positive and or negative. And finally, the advice you receive from others, provides you with wisdom and a new approach to attacking obstacles.             ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
3275120B2E8A,"A few months ago, I had a simple, yet an impactful decision to make. I either hung out with some friends, or studied for a big geometry test. Obviously, I decided to hang out with my friends. I ended up failing the test. Had I of decided to seek multiple opinions, I probably would have studied, and passed. In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Getting just one opinion is typically not extremely helpful. By asking just one person's thoughts, it is likely that they can choose the worst possible choice. However, you would not even know since you did not bother to discover how other people feel on that certain topic. Had you asked another person, they could have shown you the best conclusive option.

Another reason seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, is that it can help you truly figure out how you feel about a specific topic. For example, I was at a restaurant with my family. However, I could not decide what I desired to eat. I gave my parents my two favorite options: the pasta or a hamburger. They ended up saying I should get the pasta, but I did not stop there. In addition to asking my parents, I decided to ask the waiter when he came to receive our order. I asked if I should get the pasta, or a hamburger. He suggested the pasta. For some reason, that enabled me to clearly see I did not want the pasta, but instead the hamburger. Having others opinions helped me see that a hamburger was the best choice for me.

One may not realize it, but some people just have more wisdom retained compared to others. For example, asking your grandmother's opinion, according to statistics, will help you choose the right option eighty-eight percent of the time. Compare that to asking a toddler, who, typically are on average not fully potty trained until the age of two and a half. They have not even been a live for half of a decade. You will quite clearly get an answer with experience behind it from your grandmother, as opposed to a toddler.

Making decisions by yourself can be very difficult. That is why discovering other people's stances on topics can benefit you in choosing the better choice. Do not settle with one person's opinion. Take the effort to make the best choice, for it can impact many others, including you. Finally, I hope you have learned that you cannot just ask one person's opinion, for that may stray you on the wrong path, which you could be stuck on, for the rest of your life.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F2A6DF88AD73,"Advice, we all need it, and sometimes we need multiple opinions. We make decisions everyday, for example; ""Should I eat pancakes or eggs for breakfast,"" or, ""Should I do my laundry?"" but when seeking advice on a decision that is harder to make people usually go to who they trust most, but sometimes you need more than that. Going to different people can be helpful with these harder decisions because everyone has different points of view, and experiences.

When you need advice, going to different people can be helpful because they all have different points of view. This can lead to different outcomes and with that you always want another opinion. When looking at the different points of view you can always think through what might happen in that situation. For example, one time I needed advice on whether I should retake a unit test for math; one of my friends said to retake the test because she was thinking of helping my grade; my other friend said not to because it would stress me out. In the end, I went with the first option because my grade was important to me at the time. Decisions can be hard, but getting advice from others on what to do can help immensely.

Another reason why getting advice from different people can help is that they all have different experiences to learn from. Sometimes listening to what others have gone through helps with a decision because you can imagine what might happen through their words. For example; I was deciding whether or not I wanted to go to school on the last day. I asked two friends; one said that I shouldn't go because we weren't going to be doing much and from their experience the last day is never fun; the other said I should go because you never know how eventful the day might be and from their experience sometimes the last day is a lot of fun. When it came down to the wire I decided not to go because in the long run going that day wasn't going to benefit me.

Going to different people for advice can be helpful with harder decisions because everyone has different points of view, and experiences. Learn and grow from each other, and always make the decision that is beneficial to who it affects. In the long run these small decisions can lead to one big decision and knowing you have people to help and to give you advice is important. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

When under pressure it is always good to seek help from others but how do you know if its good?.If you have a choice it is better to get multiple opinions ,as people go thought different experiences,you can filter out and average the advice, there are always going to be biased opinions.

It is wise to get multiple opinions because people go through a different experiences. this is important because many peoples values are not the same,as how you grew up and information you have learned varies from person to person. After trying out for the school play i had been casted as ensemble. Debating whether i should drop out because of my minor role. I decided to ask a few friend about the issue. One friend had a bad experience in a previous show saying that it is never fun and if you dont have the part you want you should drop out. another friend that had a good experience in a minor role said it was fun and helps you get experience even if in the background. I value both as good friends and trust there opinions. In the end i decided to keep the role and stay in the show because even if not a major role you can improve and get experience for the next one. Multiple opinions are important because anyone with a different experience can have different views. These biases can be positive or negative, and with multiple opinions you can look over all options and sort out the pros and cons of each.

It is better to get multiple opinions and advise because you can filter out and average what you need from the advice. Averaging out the advice is a good method because you can find the pros and cons of the situation leading you to a better answer. Before starting the interesting hobby that is cosplay (spending time and money to make different character costumes to wear year round) i wanted to ask family and friends what they thought ,as this was a big decision. Many of them said that it was weird and that i should stay away from this community. Others who had cosplayed before said it was a good idea but a lot of effort . i combined these ideas and values with my own and created a pros and cons list . On one half i would have to work hard and put in effort to afford and create these costumes. On the other half it would be worth it to have a creation you can wear , get attention from,and the bonus of joining a fun and supportive community. In the end i became a cosplayer .Multiple opinions are important because you can make a pros and cons list learning from others mistakes,so you can make better decisions .

Multiple opinions are needed to make a choice because their are always going to be biases . Being biased is unavoidable ,on purpose or not everyone is influenced by opinion . Being biased is based off the experiences and values you have .Before playing a team sport you are asked to pick teams . You have already picked most of your members and there are a few kids left . One of the kids left is your friend .You want to pick them but feel you should ask the rest of the team to get their opinions. We start to talk about picking them or not. One teammate had gotten into a fight with someone from that kids friend group so he disagreed saying she doesnt want him on the team. Another teammate liked him but they werent friends so he agreed with two others that also didint want him. If i had picked this friend without asking the others it could have started a fight. I was biased to have that friend on the team because of past experiences. Their biases and experiences helped switch my opinion for the better. It is important to get multiple opinions because people will always be biased for good or for bad.

Even if your not helping with a life changing decision your input could always help someone, experiences are something that cant be replaced. If you have a choice it is better to get multiple opinions ,as people go thought different experiences,you can filter out and average the advice, there are always going to be biased opinions. For better or worse peoples experiences can influence you. Its important to filter them and use the best advise possible.

EA2B5EB1DFDA,"Statistics show that 30% of people who ask for advice from more than one person end up making a smarter decision. Life is filled with decisions, some that may influence your whole life, and some that are not very important, that's why it's good to get some extra opinions. Many people have a hard time making decisions, and appreciate the extra help they get from their friends and peers. Having more than one person give you their advice on a matter could be all the help you need. It might also make you feel better about the decision you are taking. Asking your family and friends about a matter might also give you the answer you need. Gaining more opinions and voices if always better than not getting anything.

Some problems you may encounter in life will lead to you making a very important decision, which might not be the easiest thing in the world. You make decisions every day of your life without even realizing it, such as choosing to eat breakfast or choosing to finish your homework. Those decisions might not require you to get more advice, because you are already so used to completing them each day. Studies show that as you grow up, you are faced with more important decisions, that might not only effect you. Like making a decision to move to Africa with your family, which in that case requires you to collect all the opinions of your family members, because the decision not only effects you, but your whole family also.

Receiving more voices and advice on a matter might not only allow you to make a better decision, but also allow you to gain more knowledge on that subject, like a decision to go on the keto diet. Your friend might offer pros and cons to going on a keto diet, and why you might like it or hate. Each person has their own knowledge on a certain subject, like a doctor could offer you knowledge about health matters, or a lawyer could offer you knowledge about civil matters. If you had an important decision about your health, you might want to go to your doctor to get his advice on the matter, because he knows more about that topic. He also studied more about it and is more knowing.

Coming to a conclusion on a decision might be the hardest thing you do in your life. It might make you feel depressed and down, like you can't even make a simple decision, and that's okay. That's why asking more people about it might make you feel better. An example is myself, when it comes to making choices I am the worst to come. I hate coming to conclusions, because I always feel that I made the wrong decision or didn't think enough about it, that's why I always ask my family members for advice before making a decision, it makes me feel more relaxed and happy about my choice. It also makes me feel like I got the knowledge I need I make the right decision. That's why asking more than one person, could lead to you feeling better and more relaxed, and you could finally get on with your life, knowing that you made the right choice.

Last but not least friends and family know you the best. They know what you like, and they know your personality. They are the number one people who might offer you the best advice. An example is my friend Generic_Name, she once came and asked me if it would be good for her to take a year off of college, she wanted to relax and have a year to herself. I told her no. Why you might ask, because I knew my best friend and I knew that she would feel sad and depressed if she took a year off, because she's the kind of person who likes to work, she might feel overwhelmed at times, but overall she loves the thrill of getting a new assignment. So she took my advice and didn't get a year off. The next year she felt so much happier and thanked me a lot for giving her my advice. So in conclusion what I mean is that your friends and family in the end know you better than anyone else, that's why it's good to get their opinion on a matter, especially if it concerns your future. Trust me the advice they will give you will benefit you in life.

I'm nearing the end of this essay, and I just want to say that no matter how hard you think about a decision. It's best if you get other people's opinion who might know more about that topic or subject. It's important that you find the right people to ask when looking for advice. If you are ever having trouble making a decision don't forget that your family and friends are always here to give you their opinion and advice on a matter, because that's what matters the most.

70A25239A8B7,"Some people think that asking for more than one persons advice is a good thing to do, while others would argue that you should only ask one person for their advice. I personally think that asking more than one person for advice is always the right way to go. Some people can give better advice than others can, some people know you better than others, and would know the best advice for you, and because it is always good to see more than one persons perspective. If you only have one person giving you advice then you would only see where that one person is coming from and just automatically just take their advice.

One reason why you should ask more than one person for advice is because some people can give better advice than others. Some people are more familiar with things that go on in life than others because they have been around longer. A lot of people could have experiences with something you need advice for, so all that you would have to do is ask them for their advice and they could easily help you out. Many people have different thoughts and opinions than others do. It is important to hear a lot of peoples advice so that you can put all the advice that you are given together, and then easily solve your problem. Asking more than one person for their advice is a good choice because some people give better advice than others, and it is always a good thing to do because it helps you out the most.

Another reason why you should ask more than one person for their advice is because some people know you better than others. Some people know your life choices and know your personality way better than others do. If you ask someone you are close with for their advice, that is probably going to be the best advice that you get, just because they know who you are as a person. On the other hand, if you were to ask someone who you are not that close with for their advice it might be the total opposite from what the person who you are close with gave you. If you are not close with someone that gives you advice then it most likely will not be the best thing to listen to, just because they do not know you that well. If you ask more than one person then it would be very helpful because you could hear what everyone has to say, and then you can decide which advice you want to take. Asking more than one person for their advice is a good choice because some people know you better than others, and it is very helpful to you so that you can have lots of options.

The last reason why you should ask more than one person for their advice is because it is good to see more than one persons perspective. Some people might think of something that you ask them one way, but others could see it a total different way. Not all people think the same way as everyone. Someone could say something and someone else could take what that person said and come up with a lot of their own thoughts. Even some people have thoughts could be the total opposite of what the person said actually mean't. If you look at something one way you would automatically jump to conclusion that, that is what it is, but if you look at something more than one way, then you get to see all the different perspectives about it. Asking more than one person for their advice, because you get to see a lot of more peoples perspectives, is a good thing to do because you get to see more thoughts and it will help you out a lot more.

To conclude that asking for more than one persons advice is a very good choice because some people can give better advice than others can, some people know you better than others do, and seeing more than one persons perspective, are very helpful to you as a person because you get to have multiple options, and get to see where multiple people are coming from. Asking for more than one persons advice is the best thing you can do when you are struggling in life and need some help. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B0AB337A9B59,"Having multiple opinions is like trying something new, you need someones feed back. When people ask for advice, they sometimes ask more than one person. Having multiple opinions can be helpful, for it can be easier to decide, it can help later in life, and two is better than one.

To start off, multiple opinions can make it easier to decide. The majority of people that make decisions only get one other persons' opinion. That is why most people are left feeling uncomfortable with their decision they made. If more people would ask at least two more people on their decision that they are about to make, then maybe they can come to an easier conclusion. Specifically, my father and I wanted to by this video game, but we could not make a decision between the game or the map packs for the game. I wanted to get the video game and play it with my friends, but my father wanted the map packs to his game as well. At the time we were not going to buy either of them. The my dad asked one of his friends to decide, his friend decided on the map pack. After that we purchased the map pack, and played it for two months. it got boring after a while and now we both wanted the video game. If me and my dad would have asked more people for their opinion for the game, then we would have made an easier decision.

Also, multiple opinions can help later in life. Nowadays people should always talk to a friend, their parents, or even a co-worker to help them one day. If anybody is anti-social and does not like talking about anything, no one can help them. So that why everyone should ask for an opinion on how this food taste, or maybe about some shoes they wanted, because that choice can go a long way. For instance, my mother from a young age never ask for opinions or second guessed herself. She always wanted to ask, but gave up in the process of asking. My mom was quiet and a little shy. Growing up my mom did not like shopping for clothes with her parents, they always asked her if she liked the item they picked for her, and she would just say yes. Then when she wanted something, she would never get their opinion because she was to shy. If my mom would have learn to ask for opinions at a young age, then she would feel more comfortable with her opinions in life.

In addition, multiple opinions are better than one. My family always go shopping if not for clothes then for groceries. Me and my sister always want jacket or shoes and are parents straight up say ""it looks ugly"" or ""do you have shoes that match with those."" Our parents always give opinions on our fashion sense. So we never got to get other opinion, for we always shopped with our parents. Until our grandparents and aunts and uncles came in to play. For example, me and family were at Walmart to get some vegetables. My mom wanted to come out this store with only vegetables, but she knew that wasnt the case. My dad on the other hand wanted some snacks, so me and my sister wanted some snacks too. We picked up some cookies and Doritos. Them our dad said,""yall have to ask your mother too."" If our mom would have seen the basket of treats we had, she would hurt us. So me and my sister put the cookies, and Doritos back and drove home treat less. If me and my sister would have told our mom about the snacks, then she maybe would have said yes.

In conclusion, we all need a little advice and second opinions in our life. If we all just ask our siblings or parents no one will get the full experience. Having multiple opinions helps us make easier decisions, helps us in life, and is better than just one opinion. So ask some for advice the worst thing that can happen is they do not respond.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
9627B47C10DE,"Generic_Name woke up with a churning feeling in her stomach. She still didn't know whether she should cut off her toxic friend Generic_Name or not. She picked up her phone and read the text from Generic_Name. It read, ""Hey ugly. You better not wear that hideous green shirt of yours today. I'm wearing my green dress and I don't want people to think we're matching."" Generic_Name sighed and just ignored the text. She decided to text her friend Generic_Name, who is also friends with Generic_Name, and ask her what to do. The text read, ""Hey Generic_Name, Generic_Name has been really mean to me recently and I dont know if I should stop talking to her or if I'm just being dramatic. Please help."" Generic_Name responded, ""Stop being so sensitive! Don't ruin the friend group with your petty drama and just let it go."" Generic_Name didn't expect this reaction and she still wasn't sure if she should continue being friends with Generic_Name but she didn't really have another option. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because one person could know more about the situation, someone could have gone through something similar, and you could see how different people react to the problem.

The first reason I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that one person could know more about the situation than others. For example, let's say that Generic_Name decided to ask her friend Generic_Name, who was also friends with Generic_Name, what to do. Generic_Name would probably inform Generic_Name that Generic_Name was talking bad about her behind her back and spreading rumors about her. This new information could help Generic_Name make the right choice about how to deal with the situation. Another example is if you want to buy your best friend a gift for her birthday but you don't know what to get her. You decide to ask your friends to help you pick a present and they don't know what to get her either, so you decide to ask her boyfriend what you should get her and he tells you that she told him that she wanted to take a trip to the spa. Then you would know what to get your friend because you asked someone else who knew more about the situation.

The next reason I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is someone you ask could have gone through something similar and know what to do about the situation. Let's say Generic_Name was still unsure about what to do about her toxic friend, she could ask her old friend Generic_Name, who stopped talking to Generic_Name a while ago, what to do. Generic_Name knew that Generic_Name used to playfully make fun of Generic_Name but then one day Generic_Name just left the group. Generic_Name could tell Generic_Name that she went through the same thing and she just couldn't take it anymore and she had to leave that situation. This information could help Generic_Name make a choice because she now knows that Generic_Name has treated her friends like this in the past and that she is not just being sensitive. Another example is if you want to adopt a new pet but you don't know if you should adopt a hamster or a bird, so you decide to ask your friend, who has a bird, if you would be a good bird owner. Your friend could tell you that having a pet bird takes a lot of time and you need to be able to give your birds the proper care and attention that they need. Whereas when you asked your friend who has a hamster if they need a lot of attention she said no because they are nocturnal .You know that you're a very busy person so with the information your friends gave you, you can make an educated decision to not get the bird.

Finally, I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see different people's reaction's to the situation. For instance, in Generic_Name's situation she asked three of her friends what to do about her toxic friend Generic_Name. Two of her friends told her bad things about Generic_Name and gave Generic_Name more reasons to stop being her friend, whereas only one of her friends told her to keep being Generic_Name's friend. Since more people reacted the same way to the situation, Generic_Name now had a more informed opinion and a better idea of what to do. Another example is if you want to start a business selling jars filled with dirt and you ask your friends if you should. Your friends could give you different reactions to the idea. Four of them could say that it's a terrible business idea and two of them could tell you to go for it. Since more people felt that it was a bad idea you could rethink it and make a better decision in the end.

With Generic_Name's new information and advice from her real friends, she decided it would be best if she cut Generic_Name out of her life. She got out of bed and put on her green shirt and smiled. She thought to herself, ""Generic_Name doesn't control my life or what I wear."" When she got to school she walked passed Generic_Name in the hallway and didn't even look at her. ""Hello!"" shouted Generic_Name, ""Didn't I tell you not to wear that? You look ugly in it. I was trying to save you from embarrassment."" Generic_Name didn't even turn around to respond, she just kept walking as if Generic_Name didn't exist. She was happy that she decided to listen to Generic_Name and Generic_Name's advice and not just listen to the advice from Generic_Name. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because one person could know more about the situation, someone could have gone through something similar, and you could see how different people react to the problem.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
6F29B2264805,"Getting more than one opinion for advice is very benificial, so why wouldn't you? Advice is a great key to many things, so you want to get good advice. if getting that means asking many people, than so be it. Advice will help you all throughout life, through problems, good or bad. And don't foget that someones advice isn't ever the best way to go. You want to get more than one person's opinion so you know which ways seem to work.

There are some great reasons for getting more than one person's opinion. First off, you want to make sure the advice someone tells you is common. Most of the time if advice isn't common, it usually means people don't like that way, or there's a better way. Another reason for getting more opinions is you should always ask how different ideas worked out for people. You might have heard someone did good with an idea, but someone else could've done better with something else. Lastly, you should ask different people because you might find ways that interest you. Sometimes people like ideas that don't interest you, so you have to find a way you like that's a strong enough idea.

There are many examples of getting more than one opinion when getting advice. A very important situation, is figuring out what type of college you want to go to. Some people might say, go to a community college for a couple of years or this college is really a great one. Another example is figuring out a sport you want to play. Obviously you should pick a sport that interests you, but you can always ask people what sports they've enjoyed. For a final example, helping the environment. Some people might suggest the best ways, the easiest wyas, so on and so forth.

In conclusion, there are many benifits to getting more than one opinion when getting advice. Sometimes you might go with a strong piece of advice that you personally like, or you might go with the best piece of advice you think you've heard. The only possible way of doing this is getting more than one opinion. It can help in everyday life. Getting more than one opinion is a choice, what will you choose?",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
00A4CB36E006,"Do you get advice from people? Many people do but some just go off what one person says to do. Most people like to have more than one or even many people give them advice before they make a choice. There is nothing wrong with only getting advice from one person but it might not be the best option. Most people tell other people something but can not relate to what is going on. As people we might tell other people things we would not normally do. I think it is important to get different people to give you advice because multiple people can help a person make a better choice, it can help a person change their out look on the matter, and it is better so one person can not tell you something and try to make things worse.

Getting advice from different people can help a person because people have different point of views. This is a good way for people to view and and better understand their options. Advice from others will help people see what is good and bad for each option. When people explain why they think it is a better option it will be easy for the person to pick a side or a choice. Since everyone gives different advice it will help make better options more clear. When you get advice from other people you only get to see what they think.

When getting advice from people it can help change someone's out look on the matter. When people give you different advice you get to see both sides of what is going on. This may make a person change their mind or even choose to something else. This is a good way to view what people are trying to tell someone to do. This type of advice is also a good way to learn how to help give other people advice. When people change your out look it will help make you choose what is best for you.

Another reason I think it is good to get advice from more than one person is because people can try to tell you the wrong thing. This could make things worse because they are giving you bad advice. That means they are not trying to help you but, they want you to do the wrong thing instead of what is better for you. If a person who does not like you gives you advice it can mostly likely mean they want you to fail or make a bad choice. When people get advice from many different people they will not have this problem. Therefore people who who have not been through what you have going through can not really relate or understand what is going on. This means you want advice from people who really knows how to help.

There are many reasons why getting more people to give you advice is better than just one person. People who get more advice tend to make a better choice then people who have one person telling them what to do. When you get advice you should want more than one person telling you what to do. When you get the right advice it will make the right choice clear and easy to pick. It is important to get different people to give you advice because multiple people can help a person make a better choice, it can help a person change their out look on the matter, and it is better son one person can not tell you something and try to make things worse.            ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B6A7E0AA3574,"Everyday we are faced with a decisions we have to make, from picking a movie, to deciding whether or not to take on an new job. No matter the decisions we're making, we all tend to ask others for advice. But why do we turn to others for advice instead of just one person? When we ask others for advice on a situation or decision, we are usually unsure on what to do and what the best choices to make are. By seeking multiple opinions from others we are given new opportunities, and points of view.

In many different situations around the world we look to our elders for advice. Elders are seen as the wisest by many and by asking them for advice you can learn about their experiences, what happened, and what changes they would have made. Using the information they shared you can apply it to your own problem and avoid the mistakes they made in the past.

Depending on the decision your making, you may also need someone's advice to clear your head. If your emotionally attached to someone or something involved in the decision or problem you may be blinded by the feeling you have toward them or the object. Being blinded by emotions can cause you to make ill-founded and panicked decisions. Its better to ask someone who is not involved for advice, they will have a better idea on what to do and have a different point of view.

Lastly, asking multiple people for advice that have different backgrounds will provide many different ideas and opinions. For example If your living in New York and you ask a cowboy how to find a parking space in Times Square, he won't know. He may give ideas or explain how he find parking Texas, but you would need someone who understands the situation from their own experiences. By asking people with different backgrounds you may get advice that you needed or some that you ever thought about.

Many different people give different types of advice and see problems differently by having a large amount of people give advice about a decision you have to make will give you a better understanding of all the possibles and what the best choice is. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
2CB23505789E,"Have you ever had a hard choice to make and needed a lot of advice? Is it easier to just listen to one person's opinion or many?

Seeking multiple opinions for advice can help you greatly when you need to make a decision. It helps to hear from people who hold different perspectives and beliefs, have different experiences, and many different opinions.

A lot of people think differently and have different beliefs, even with their religion. Therefore, by listening to just one person, you may only get that one person's opinion about what he or she believes is right. It is important to listen to what many others have to say in order to make the best decision for yourself. Recently, I got a bad grade on a math test. My grade hadn't gone below a 98% in Algebra so far. This test brought me down a whole letter grade. I didn't know if I should retake it or not. I knew it probably wouldn't bring my grade up much. However, I still didn't know what to do. I asked my Math teacher, my parents, and a few of my friends. Each looked at the situation differently. After listening to all of these perspectives, I put them together and formed my own decision. As long as I did my homework and got a good grade on the next test, I would be back up to an A and not have to retake it. I was helped a lot by getting different opinions of people with different backgrounds.

Also, different people have had different experiences, when preparing to go into 8th grade, I couldn't decide which elective class I should take. I narrowed the decision down to either Art or Tech Ed. I didn't know what to do, so I asked all three of my older sisters who had recently gone through Generic_School, the school that I was currently at. One of my sisters said she loved Art and I should take it. Another said that a lot of boys enjoy Tech Ed, and you get to build a lot of cool stuff. I was still on the fence, so I asked my dad. He said the stuff you do and the tools you use in Tech Ed will be a lot more useful as my life went on. I came to the final decision of Tech Ed. This is just one example of why asking for advice of multiple people with different experiences is so important. If I had just listened to what my first sister said, I would probably be doing Art.

Lastly, by listening to what many other people say, It helps you form a better conclusion for yourself. It is important to listen to others opinions so you can form your own. Humans can do so much more when they put their minds together. Getting many perspectives from other people and putting them together to form the best decision is the best way to do it. It is imperative that your choice reflects what many people say, and not just one. There are so many different opinions to be heard.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. There are many different opinions out there. People look at things differently and have different beliefs, and everybody doesn't have the same experiences. Even on just little things like retaking a test or figuring out your courses for the upcoming year. Listening to other peoples opinions will always help you form the best one. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5BCE3F6D4C83,"Maybe you don't realize it yet, but all the advice you receive will benefit you in some way, even if the advice given is with ill intent. Asking more than one person will in theory remove bias, as having multiple perspectives can give feedback from all sides of the equation. Some people that are asked for advice may not take it seriously and act sarcastic or patronizing toward the person in need of it. In turn, others may see this as an opportunity to manipulate you into thinking something they want you to believe, with them benefiting from that belief in some way. There are some people who have good intention and believe in you and the prospect of you being successful in whatever you may be going through. Those people set your views a little straighter, and dampen the uproar caused by others with poor intentions.

Many people just want to mess around, and have fun, while toying with you, and while they might try to convince you to believe something silly or far fetched, you almost never believe them. At least, as you grow and your mind develops, you wont. These people target younger people, as they are more susceptible to believe whatever they've been told, as they see elder beings as wiser, and further experienced, and with good reason. They will get you to believe something, then humiliate you in front of others, making you feel like an idiot. However, they don't do it with ill intention. They realize that as you grow up, you will see others like that, and, whether they are aware of it or not, they want to prepare you for what is to come. They are the ones who provide you with humility, an essential trait to live with.

Unfortunately, there are people who don't have the right idea. These people have no real intention of helping you or providing advice, but want to manipulate you and to see you fall. Once you fall, they use you as a stepping stone, and elevate themselves with your broken body. They have ill intention, perhaps to get back on another friend, family member of yours, or you. They prosper in the land of those suffering, for they are not in a similar agony. They created this pain, this blister, and are there to see it grow, and become more and more of a problem for those around you. The suffering around them brings a selfish and vile enjoyment to them. You become a weapon, a tool, and grow upon self awareness and strength. You learn to keep fighting.

Finally, there are people with real advice that they know you'll need. These people don't even have to be asked for their point of view. They give an honest opinion on what you should do, while still leaving the choice completely up to you. Nothing they tell you is with ill intent, and while what they say may make you upset, it is something they most likely want you to reflect upon. They want you to be able to live your life the way you want to. They want to witness you with confidence in all your actions, and integrity in all your mistake and faults. You aren't expected to be perfect, but they will expect you to aim for perfect. However, perfection isn't about being successful in all you do, but moreover striving for improvement.

You can't really get advice from one of these kinds of people, even the ones with good intentions. With only real and honest advice, that makes you want to do better, you end up getting ahead of yourself; being too confident can get you hurt badly. With manipulative advice, you don't know what you fight for, or what your fighting in the first place. You need humility to counter whatever may be causing this violence, and to see whatever may causing this is with ill intention, and only seeks to harm others with you. Only having humility will get you nowhere, and you will be in hiding all your life. Having all of these traits will benefit you greatly, and let you become independent in your actions. Having a healthy balance of this will create a good average and mindset of these different types of advice, and allow you to make better decisions.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
89E1BF0D40C8,"When people ask for advice why do they ask multiple people? When you ask more than one person for their advice, you get multiple points of view. Asking more than one person for advice is better because almost every person has had a different experience with something. If you only talk to one person and you just go off of what they tell you, your decision is going to be bias. The reasons why asking multiple people is better than just one are you get multiple points of view, every one has a different experiecs and opinion, and so your decision is not bias.

The first reason asking multiple for advice is good is you get multiple points of view. If you only have one point of view you do not know all the real facts. All you know is what that one person told you and your decision is not going to be accurate. If you had multiple points of view you would know a lot more facts and your decision would be a lot more accurate. That is the first reason why multiple people's opinions are better than one.

The second reason is asking multiple people for advice is better than one is every person has had a different experience. For example, say your looking to buy a new truck, you pick out one you like and you ask one person with the same truck if they like it, and they say that they hate it and it never runs right. Then you ask two other guys if they like it, and they say they love it and it runs perfect. You buy it and then you really love it, but if you had just listened to the first guy you never would have bought it. That is the second reason why you ask more than one person.

The final reason is if you talk to just one person your decision is going to be bias. When you have not heard from anyone else but that one person you believe them and think they are 100 percent right. They could be right, or they could be terribly wrong, but you don't know because you have no way to tell if they are right or not. If you hear from two or more people you won't be bias because you have multiple people's opinions. That is the final reason why multiple people are better than just one.

In the end you should always ask more than one person. Never ask one person, you are probably gonna end up with a bias opinion. If you have a bias opinion your most likely not going to make the best decision. If you ask one person he might be right, he might be wrong but asking multiple people will tell you if he is right or wrong. Those are all the reasons why asking multiple people for advice is better than only asking one.             ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F2941764EE14,"When people need advice they usually ask more than one person so they don't do the wrong thing, can help other people, and they can gain trust. Asking people for help is like going to a store and knowing what your going to buy. So when people get help it can make them a better person in life because it can help people with anxiety. Helping with anxiety is important because some people who have anxiety are sometimes antisocial. Also people that are antisocial can do better in life so talking to people especilly asking for help can help a lot.

First, asking for help and knowing what to do can help them to help other people so they can help you back in the future. For example other people would to help them because some people would feel guilty if they don't help back. Another reason why helping other people is that people can make friends because people sometimes want friends who are nice and can help when they ask. Another reason is that if people dont know them that well then they can think different things about them. For example if they help them it will make them know they're a nice person and they will become a nicer person.

Next, asking for help from more than one person can help people is so they don't do the wrong thing. For example when some people do something wrong at a job the boss or coworkers can get mad and could yell at them and make their life worse. Also doing something wrong can cause people to dislike them because some people don't like people who mess up sometimes. For example when people mess up some people would think they're clumsy and would dislike them for messing up, which I think is messed up. Also not doing the wrong thing can make them think it can help them with things they thought they couldn't do. For example if they keep asking for help on how to do something they thought they couldn't do but did it they would feel accomplished and probably try to do new things in life.

finally, when asking more than one person on how to do something and they don't lie they will start gaining trust. For example when people gain trust they want to keep asking those same or other people so that they know they wont lie to them. Another reason is that they would be happier if they gained someones trust or someone gained their trust. For example if someone gained their trust and they gained someones trust then they would be happy since someone trust them and they trust someone so they could help each other when the need it. Also it can gaining trust can help with anxiety and antisocial people since they're talking to people. For example they would be gaining peoples trust if ask people for help and they would start talking more, start talking louder, and talking more clearer.

In conclusion, these things help people with their lives because some people dont talk to people or just are antisocial and when I used to be antisocial I would ask other people to help with with things that I was stuck on and then when they would ask for my help I would help them. So when I started talking more and more It was when I was asking for help and it really helped me in my life becaue now I have more friends that my old antisocial self thought I would have.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5C9E6CCEAF57,"Sometimes when people are trying to make a decision they look to their peers for their input on the situation. Some of the benefits to looking to others for help is you will get a variety of opinions, more knowledge about the topic you're making a decision on, and different perspectives of the situation.

In the end this can make it easier to come to a final decision.

Getting opinions from multiple people can greatly impact your decision. Other people might think that you should deal with the situation a different way then what you were planning to do. this can open up your eyes to other options, you may decide that you like their suggestion better than what you had originally planned to do. Some people also might have already experienced the situation that you are dealing with, this will give you input from someone who has already been through the same situation, you can compare this with what you are dealing with. They would also be able to tell you how they handled the situation and how the people around them responded. From there you can use what they have told you about their experience and maybe do the same thing as they did.

Asking more than one person for advice can also help you make a better decision. Some people might have a lot of knowledge about the topic you are making your decision on. for example lets say you are trying to decide where to go on your camping trip. The first person you talk to could have only gone camping once but the fifth could have been going camping for years. This person would know a lot about camping and all of the different camping sites; which ones are good and which ones are bad. If you had only talked to that one person than you could of picked a terrible camp site and had an awful overall experience but because you talked to more than one person you ended up getting more knowledge about campsites and had a terrific time camping. Over all you are able to make a more educated decision with other opinions.

Getting different peoples perspectives is another benefit to asking multiple people for advice. The situation could look different from different perspectives. Talk to other people about what you think you are going to do, get them to tell you what they think of your decision from an outside point of view. Getting multiple people to do this will give you a wider variety of peoples perspectives it may help you realize how your decision will impact other people. which This will help you make a more conscious decision.

Concluding I think that looking to others for advice is a great idea, It will give you a variety of opinions, more knowledge about the topic you're making a decision on, and different perspectives of the situation. Other people may have been in the situation that you are dealing with and you would never know that if you didn't reach out and ask for help.

You also may not have realized the impact some of the decisions you are making impact on others. Overall it will help you make a better decision and deciding what is right for you.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
900853D24E86,"People love to have their on ideas but Is it important to hear other peoples advice? I think yes it is because of many reason including, one way is that they can hear what they did and what happened. Also they will have different ideas about what they experienced,and they can tell their story. Another one is after they all say their stories the person can pick the best one that they can choose the best one. That he or she likes the best and best relates to what he or she wants.

One way is to hear what they did and what happened because of what he or she did. Did he or she do the right thing or wrong thing what was the consequences. What if it was bad did they get in trouble and if so do you want to get in trouble. Even if he or she knows they will get in trouble would he or she still do it. I am not fully sure it is appending on what it is. Yes people can do bad things but if they know about it they are choosing to do it when they know the consequences. I personally think that it is good to hear what they did and what had happened when they did it to see if he or she should do it.

Another way is for them to tell their story if a person tells another person their story they can do the same thing,but he or she can make a couple different choices. To do the same thing but have a different outcome. Say a person tells another person a story. The other person wants to do it but in the story a person does something wrong say a speeding ticket. He or she can do the same thing but have different outcome by not speeding. See he or she can hear the story but change things to make it work for them.

The last idea for having multiple options is at the end of everyone talking to the person. Say a person didn't know what to do so he asked 10-15 people and they all gave him different ideas so he or she gets home and thinks. What one am I going to choose he had good ones and bad ones. So he or she rights all the ones on different note cards and throws away the bad ones and at the end she has 5 left. Now he or she thinks and eliminates 2 more now he or she has 3. The last 3 are good ideas so he or she thinks about it his or her choices. The one with the least money but also has a lot of entertainment which was go carting. It has low cost and high entertainment he or she can limit his or her choices by good and bad and how the person is feeling to give them a answer on where to go.

In conclusion, I think that having multiple options is one of the best things to have but that is in my option. By having different ideas coming to a person have ideas that a person would never think of. Like skydiving,snowboarding,skating,golfing or many other things can come to a person. However people can help influence us as long as the person knows right from wrong. By good selection, good people, and knowing what happens in those stories. A person could have a wonderful day and a lot of choices that no one would think of.  ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
1BA91BC3D89A,"Generic_Name and Generic_Name are on their way to the pet store in seek of a household pet that can accompany them. They want to get a dog, but don't know how to take care of one. ""How should we find information about taking care of a dog?"" Generic_Name said with tear filled eyes. ""I don't know but we should ask around the pet store for help."" Generic_Name said. Generic_Name looked at him in confusion and said, ""Why don't we just ask the person who works in the dog department?"" Generic_Name looked at Generic_Name with a wide grin and explained, ""It's better to ask more than one person when getting information because everyone has a different view on dogs and how to take care of them."" Generic_Name then understood as they walked around the store asking different store employees about what they need and what they need to do to take care of a dog. Not everyone's opinion or advice is valid or important in certain circumstances. This means just asking a singular individual on a topic might not be the best choice or even give you the best advice. People should seek and ask multiple sources on advice because they get clearer information, see different view points, and get more feedback.

First off, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can get clearer information on a topic. For example, I went to a website to search for how to stay calm when your stressed. It didn't give me a clear answer so I searched up another site. This one told me exact steps and procedures on how to calm yourself in a stressful situation. It gave me a better understanding on why looking at multiple sources can give someone better and clearer information. In addition, when my sister needed help at swim practice, she asked multiple people on her swim team how to do a certain stride instead of asking just one person. This helped her see an arrangement of different techniques that gave her different perspectives on how to do the one stride correctly. Later, she went up to her coach and asked her for clarification on how to do the move as well. This helped her choose whether she needed to practice her stride more or just to improve on little alterations. This leads into the next topic on how different view points can help someone make a better choice.

Next, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can see from different view points. For example, I looked at reviews on a product before buying it to see what other people's opinions on the product were. If I were just to have bought the product without reading whether it would work or not, it could result in me losing my money and having a useless product. Seeing other peoples different views and opinions can alter my own opinion and lead me to a better choice in a product to pick from. Additionally, my dad, when he was picking out a cat from a shelter, took into great consideration of the advice the workers gave him on what he needed to take care of a cat and how. However, he also asked around with people in the cat owner community who helped him out as well. The different view points that the shelter and the cat owner community had were vital in the way that gave him the proper tools and techniques to use when taking care of a cat. This leads to the final example on how asking for advice from multiple people can give someone more feedback which helps them in making a choice.

Finally, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can get more feedback. Furthermore, my cousin plays the trumpet at a professional level and most of the time needs feedback on his performances to see how he did. After his shows, he usually asks some audience members how he preformed and if he could improve in someway what could he improve on. It really helps him see what he needs to do better on by asking multiple people, rather than just asking a singular trumpeter in his band. It also helps him decide if he needs to practice more or if he sounded amazing and preformed at the best of his ability. As well as, when I record a video of me playing my instrument I ask more than one person for feedback. I email my band instructor on how I did and on how I can improve for later performances. I then ask my mom and dad on how I did by playing the video for them and ask if they heard that I sounded squeaky, or if I need to redo my video because the sound quality is low as well as other things. The more feedback I have on how I did, the better of chances I have improving my playing skills along the way.

Generic_Name and Generic_Name walk out of the pet store with nothing more than a dog and the essentials for owning one. They both give each other a wide smile and a sigh of relief as they walk home with their new family member. ""Thanks for asking around on how to care for Fluffy,"" who Generic_Name had named. ""It was way better than just asking one person for everything we needed!"" Generic_Name looked at her again with a stern face, ""Now you know the important's of not just asking one person for advice, but for asking multiple people to see their opinions and options on certain topics. Just because they don't have an answer doesn't mean that no one does."" Generic_Name looks at him with a gloomy face and apologizes for her misunderstanding. ""Feedback from others will also help us change and better our understanding on how to take care of our dog."" As they continue to walk home, they both realize that not everyone's advice is good and not everyone is bad. But asking multiple people for help does give you a better understanding than just one straight forward answer. Some people's opinions in some situations won't help you in making a better decision. In conclusion, people should seek and ask multiple sources on advice because you get clearer information, see different view points, and get more feedback.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
D344430F21DA,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes go to more than one person. Advice is something people look for when they need reassurance or confirmation on a subject. Martin Luther King Jr. stated, ""People look for advice in multiple people for confirmation that they are doing the right thing."" Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a wiser decision because it will give them more options to think about, it will give them more than one perspective, and they can put all of the options together.

First off, it will give them more options to think about. When you ask more than one person for advice, then that can give you multiple options to go through in your head. For example, at church when I am going through a rough time, I always ask multiple people for advice so that I can have many options to choose from in my head. Another example I have is, when I need advice on school issues, I always ask my parents because I know they will give me two great pieces of advice to choose from. To end, People should ask more than one person for advice because it will give them more options to think about.

Second, it will give them more than one perspective on the situation. When you have more than one perspective from multiple people then it could help you make the best decision. For example, when I was having a tough time at school, I talked to a couple people that are close to me and got their perspectives on the situation and I was able to fix my problem. However, when you get advice from multiple people and they give you their perspective on the situation, some of them might have bad things to say and some might have good things to say. You can always take out the bad perspectives and use the good ones. For example, I was asking my friends at church their perspective on a situation at home, and some of them gave me good perspective, but others gave me not so good perspectives. In the end I just used the good perspectives because they would help me out in the long run. In closing, people should ask more than one person or advice because it can give them more than one perspective.

Lastly, they can put all of the opinions together. When people give you advice on a situation they could be giving you different advice from the other people you talked to, so you can just put the advises together. For example, I was asking my mom and dad for advice on what I should for my french project, and they both gave me different advice, so I just used both and my project turned out amazing. However, other times people could be giving you the same advice other people gave you but maybe turned around different. In that case you can also put them together to make your situation better. For example, I was asking my brother and his friend if I should tell my friend something, and they both said almost the same thing, so I used both of their opinions and my situation with my friend worked out better than it would have with just one opinion. To summaries, people should get more then one opinion because you can put them together.

To conclude, people should seek advice from multiple people because it will give them more options to go through, it will give them more perspectives to think about, and they can put all of the opinions together. If a person does not ask for advice from more then one person, then they might not get the advice they where looking for. If a person chooses to ask multiple people for advice, then they will more than likely get the advice they where looking for. All of these reason I stated above are great reason why you should seek advice from more than one person. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
9D0665A39328,"Seeking advice from different people can be helpful, because it can expand upon your view of a topic.

A person asking for advice will sometimes ask multiple people for advice, to get different opinions on a topic

These opinions can either help the person with learning about a topic or they could just be receiving incorrect information. This can also lead to the person becoming confused about the topic and ultimately fail to resolve their topic. And while they are confused the could be led to do the wrong thing and lead to worse consequences.

But they can also gather a lot of correct information which would help with opening them up to more choices, if given the correct information. Getting advice from multiple people can also lead to choices that benefit more people or just a more open minded decision. These decisions can really affect the outlook of someones topic, for somebody giving a person incorrect advice could lead to a horrible decision.

But most importantly while seeking advice you should seek multiple inputs to decide which one is the best fit, so when you make your final choice its the best one. Making sure the advice you get is credible is also easier when you ask multiple people because of similar advice.

For the best advice you should ask multiple people it expands upon your view of thew topic and greatly helps you come to a final decision and helps you learn even more.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
089DE1EB8CAF,"We ALL strive to make good choices in life, that goal is very hard to obtain without the help of others. Talking to multiple people before making decisions is an essential thing to do because we can learn from mistakes others made and make the best possible decision. It's impossible to know everything and make perfect choices on our own, that's why our peers are here to help.

It's very important to talk to others that have made the same or similar decisions that we will be making so we don't make the same mistakes they made. For example, I once saw my friends planned to fight after school on Friday. I didn't want to tell on them but I also didn't want them to fight. I asked my parents and a couple of my friends for advice. I took all of the advice and eventually got them to call off the fight without any adults knowing. My dad the told me that he made the mistake when he was younger of letting his two friends fight and they both got in trouble. Since I asked many people for advice, I avoided making the same mistake he made. People that commit crimes don't seek advice or different opinions so they end up doing what they think is good and that's not always right. It's easy to think that a criminal would see other criminals in jail and be discouraged, but that's not the case. They end up making a bad choice because they refused to seek out different opinions and advice before they acted. It may seem hard to make the right choice and not mess up but others are there to help make the right decision for everyone.

Important people like a CEO or the President of the United States don't make decisions for their corporation or the U.S. on their own, they talk to many of their peers first for advice. The best possible decision isn't always what benefits you the most. You must take others into account when you're decision making. That's why it's important to converse with others so you can get their point of view and their advice. The right decision is what's best for everyone, not just yourself. In some cases, there isn't a choice that will benefit everyone. In those times it's important not to doubt yourself because that will lead to a unfavorable outcome. For example, there was a time when I had to choose between staying home from school and helping my sick mom, or going to school and helping with a group project where I as the leader. My gut feeling was to stay home but I couldn't let my group down. I ended up staying home because my mother is more important than school. I did have to do make-up work because I missed school but I was glad that I had helped my mom. I felt that was the best choice I could make. The right decision shouldn't benefit us the most; the right decision lies within other needs.

Perfect choices don't happen when thinking to ourselves. It's the decision maker's job to converse with smarter people so they can make the choice that benefits everyone. Everyone's point of view is important and deserves to be shared. Advice can come from anyone, this advice helps make the truly perfect choice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
58669BF55DF1,"Imagine living in a world where everybody thinks alike. A place where everybody has the same political views, the same views on relationships and even ice cream flavor.

A world that lacks different kinds of people with different mindsets is no world at all. Without unique mindsets to guide you through the highs, lows and small mysteries of life, we would all be at a roadblock. Weather you seek advice from outsiders often or do so once every blue moon, every person you ask will answer your question differently, with a unique thought process of their own. Seeking multiple opinions can guide someone to make a better choice in various ways, such as opening their eyes to something they hadn't previously thought about, and having them realize what someone else would do if they were in that same position, taking multiple opinions into consideration is beneficial to all of us.

Asking others simply for their input on a subject can deeply affect the way that you may view something. Outsiders viewpoints on a subject can change our perspectives drastically, opening our eyes to a new and different way of thinking. Every single one of us has had something in our past that affects our decision making process, weather its based on our experiences or how we were raised. It may be that you think through things with more caution, or don't think through things at all and thats why you are so spontaneous. I once asked a friend if I should get a necklace with pearls on it or a necklace with golden stars on it. She told me the one with stars on it because she enjoyed the way it looked on me. I then turned to my other friend who was known for thinking through things with a bit more caution and logical thinking. She started to ask me questions, ""What necklace would you get more use out of?"" ""Which necklace could you wear in all of the seasons?"" ""What necklace is the most similar to a necklace that you already have?"" With her advice I then realized that I owned necklaces that were similar to the stars at home and I would get much more use out of the pearls because they went with all of my outfits and were always classy. I would have had a necklace with golden stars on it, that I may have not gotten much use out of. However, with the input of another outside source I was able to eliminate that situation from happening. Though this is an example on a small scale with little actual effect or strong importance, the same thought process applies to something on a larger scale. With more viewpoints and opinions comes the idea of higher knowledge and with knowledge comes more implied power.

Realizing that everybody has unique and different viewpoints can be extremley beneficial to all of us. When we take advantage of many unique view points it helps us to make a better choice. Hearing the thoughts and opinions of others opens our eyes to ideas that we may not have previously taken into consideration, the viewpoints of others may even make us realize what someone else would do if they were in our position. Everybody has a past that affects and alters the way that they make everyday decisions or life changing decisions. However, with the help of multiple people's opinions, it can lead us down the pathway of a better decision. Next time you need help with picking the better choice, seek multiple people with different view points to really find the true right choice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
04C4DFEECF27,"Have you ever had to decide on something, and you don't know what to do so you ask one person and then you chose based on what they said and it is wrong. This is where asking multiple people for advice helps. When you ask multiple people for advice you get to see what everyone thinks you should do. If you ask multiple people they will try to help you come up with an answer. When I was going to baseball practice, I couldn't decide between two hats. I asked my dad and he said the red one, I asked my mom and she said the red one too. Then I asked my brother and he also said the red one so I wore the red hat to practice. You should ask multiple people for advice because you get to hear all the opinions, you can get help figuring out what to chose, and you get too hear all the different choices you can pick .

You should ask multiple people for advice so you can hear all the opinions. Lets say you can't decide on a movie so you ask one person they tell you their favorite movie. It might not be your favorite movie but you took their advice and watched it. Instead of asking one person you should ask multiple people. Lets say that you ask 10 people and 7 chose the same movie, that means that a lot of people recommend you to watch that movie. Studies show that if you ask more people for advice instead of one person, it helps you make the right decision.

When you get help from more than one person it helps you figure out what to choose. In elementary school, I had a group of friends help me survey a couple classes to figure out what they would want more, A new playground or new computers. After we surveyed everyone we figured out that people wanted, newer computers. If I hadn't asked people for their opinion then I would have picked a new playground. Asking advice on what too chose helps you every day. You can ask where to go on vacation, what car to get, what to do on your day off, or even what to have for dinner tonight. Studies show that when you ask somebody what you should choose rather then deciding yourself, when you ask somebody else you make better decisions

When you ask multiple people for advice instead of one person you get to hear all the different choices you can make. Lets say you want to play basketball or baseball, and you ask somebody and they say why don't you play soccer and you decide to play soccer. This can help you come up with more options then you had before you asked people for help. Studies show that most options people pick they don't think themselves, but they ask another person and they tell them the option.

I know that it is sometimes hard to ask for advice but it really does help. I have made the mistake of only asking one person for their advice and I dont want you to make the same mistake as I did. Next time you ask for help, you should ask multiple people because you get to hear all the opinions, you get help figuring out what to choose, and you get to hear all the different choices you can make.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5B33DBFCC997,"When people ask for advice, they talk to more than one person, which helps them make a better choice. The reason to why seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice is because they have different opinions and it gives more options to make than just one.

When seeking advice, asking advice from different opinions can help make a better choice. For one, multiple opinions have different backgrounds and answers. Second, multiple opinions have different levels of understanding, ensuring that you get a good opinion from at least one person. Finally, multiple opinions can gives more than one answer as one opinion gives just one

More opinions can give more options to make. First, you have multiple ideas of your choice. Second, the more perspectives you get, the more materials you have for your choices. Finally, more opinions makes sure that you have a better chance at making a good choice than just hearing one opinion.

Therefore, Multiple opinions can help people make a better choice because of the different opinions and the multiple choices it gives.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
3253860FE997,"In times of distress and need, people often seek advice from others, but sometimes having only one opinion is not good enough for us. On the other hand, a multitude of opinions can provide many benefits towards us. For example, have a multitude of opinions is almost always the safer option. Having only one opinion means your placing everything on the line that it is correct, however, with a variety of opinions you have all the time you need to decided which one you will side with.

When seeking multiple opinions, you can find the opinion that is just right for you. With a larger group to consult with there is a bigger chance that you will find the opinion that perfectly suits your needs. Personally, this has always worked for me because being surrounded by peers sets me to a ease of mind, where I can clearly think and communicate. Also, there is close to no chance that you will feel pressured into any opinion, it is quite the opposite of that, you may feel overwhelmed or flooded.

Another reason why having multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that you can be assured that you are correct. With many different people all giving you opinions, it wont be hard to find someone with an idea similar to yours. You will feel that you fit in more, as people agree with your original idea, they can also help modify it to perfection. This will lead to a boost in self confidence, less hesitation, and won't start a reliance on peers. Great friendships can easily start, and they usually do, from people relating to each others ideas/beliefs. This usually works for me as I situate myself around people who think close to me.

A final reason is that you will have the benefit of peer review upon your decision. This is a great way to have your work evaluated to perfect your choice. Peer review is a beneficial tool that can be used in almost all decision making. Peer review can also help boost self confidence within someone, as you can be more certain about your choice if others agree with it. For example, before I ever turn in anything, I always consult with multiple peers in order to perfect my assignment. Peer review can positively change your decision to benefit you in a great way.

To summarize, I believe seeking multiple opinions about a single issue is a better idea then seeking only one. I think this because of the many benefits that come along with it. These include having a wide variety of opinions to choose from, not feeling pressured into anything, being assured you are correct, and peer review. Together these will provide you with a good decision to almost any issue.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
FB946CB635AC,"Have you ever asked someone for advice and they give you a bland answer or an advice that you just do not like? I think when seeking for advice you should always seek multiple advice from a variety of people because you have more options to try, it widens your knowledge about the subject, and you learn more about the people you are asking.

Your overall knowledge of the subject would grow majorly by asking for multiple advice. When you knowledge is widened about a subject it helps you understand the problem or event more. Knowing a lot about the event or problem is just one part of making a good choice. You can you use knowledge about the problem with ideas that other people had. Overall when you know more about the subject you are asking advice for it can fuel a better choice.

Asking for lots of advice gives you more options to use to build a good choice. Therefore you get lots of feedback when you try different advice. You can also use feedback to your advantage. Resolving a problem is all about trial and error and learning what you have to do to overcome the problem. You may not even have to use trial and error if the advice works and you can come up with a good choice. Therefore the knowledge from your feedback and advice you can form it all together and make a great choice.

Pushing the problem solving to the side, when asking for advice you will learn a lot about a person from the advice they give you. Asking for advice and agreeing on something could spark a friendship with someone. If you agree on a advice while caring out the choice that you made your would have a good attitude about it and the advice would probably work. Working together is also a great option when you have to make a good choice. It can combine two different views into one great choice.

In conclusion, I think you should always seek multiple people for advice because it widens your knowledge, you have more options to try, and your learn more about people. Your overall knowledge of the event,subject, or problem would grow because you just asked a couple more questions. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B6D4400A3B06,"My mother always said ""Generic_Name, life is much simpler when you trust and take advice from others."" Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, for they can use those opinions to make an objective one, they can learn lessons from others, and it can cause someone to become a better person.

First an objective opinion can help by, being unbiased therefor one can make harder decisions that can effect their life in serious ways. it can also keep one from siding with a bad influence or group out of bias or personal opinion, therefor keeping out of trouble or harmful situations.

Next using these opinions can teach someone useful lessons in life, like who to hang out with, and how much trouble one can avoid, or even if they should buy that new phone without looking at the reviews. Those reviews are very important for someone if they are going to buy something. If they pay attention to them, they can find out if the purchase is worth it or not. That is why its beneficial to take lessons from others' opinions.

Then there is the fact that listening to other peoples' opinions can create a better person, it can give them something to fall back on when they cannot use their own wits to escape a situation. Because of this people will want to trust them, and want to help them when in need. These in turn will raise their sense of self tremendously, and create an all around better citizen.

Finally using these opinions someone can, create an objective opinion, they can learn valuable lessons from others, and become the best person they possibly can be.

108C28958E5B,"Lots of people go through life based upon their own opinions, but truthfully, having multiple peoples' opinion leads to making better choices.

If you try and make an important decision based off of only your own opinion, you could face a truckload of consequences.

Going to friends, family, or someone else you trust for advice is a great way to have more input while facing a decision.

These people could have a different point of view on the matter, have more experience on the topic, or they've made mistakes and can help you learn from them.

If someone has a different opinion or reasoning on a topic, they could help you to look at the issue from their point of view, which might change your mind on the matter.

Being able to look at a problem from both sides of the argument could positively affect your decision, whether it's choosing a side or settling on a compromise.

For example, if you're not sure you should tryout for a team, or be involved in a school play, ask for opinions from your parents and friends to see what they think you should do.

Their input would not only help you make a decision, but also build your confidence in what you're trying to achieve.

Getting multiple opinions on an issue would really help to make better choices on the topic.

Second, finding someone with a lot of experience on the subject can help improve your choice making.

They've gone through the process, or possess a lot of knowledge on the topic, that could help inform you on the best choice to make.

For instance, let's say you really want to buy a brand new surfboard, but you don't know which brands and models are the best.

You could go on a professional surfers' website and see what board he uses and/or recommends.

This would let you know that the surfboard is a top-notch board, considering someone who surfs for a living uses it.

Finding someone with lots of experience and getting their opinion is crucial in making an important decision.

Third and finally, getting peoples' opinion based off not only their own, but also your mistakes can result in improved decisions/results in the future.

You could learn what to do because of something they did wrong, or you could've been the one to make a mistake, and they could tell where you messed up.

Let's suppose you went fishing with your dad and put your bait on wrong, causing it to slip off the hook when you cast the line.

Your dad could help show what you did wrong, and correct it, because he has made the same mistake before.

Learning from mistakes is a great way to improve and have better judgment next time.

Getting an opinion from a different point of view, receiving advice from a person with lots of experience, and creating opinions based on your own or others mistakes are all great ways to making better choices.

The person could change your mind on the topic, inform you with knowledge that you didn't possess before, or tell you what they did wrong and what not to do.

Whatever it is, talking with someone will help you choose, and feel more confident making a decision.

The whole group just sighs and gives Generic_Name a quick glance with a voice backing it all up saying, ""She just isn't right for you that's why."" Generic_Name looks to the ground with defeat on the outside but rage filled on the inside which causes him to try giving a quick defending response. All that came out of his mouth was,""Well what if you're wrong,"" Which caused the whole group to walk away with quiet whispers and a few laughs. Seeking advice from more than one person is a better choice because it gives you different points of view, more options to choose from, and keeps you closer to the people around you.

First off, seeking opinions from others can be a better choice than only getting an opinion from one person because, it gives you multiple points of view. A great example of this is when my friend Generic_Name got in a fight once. He got sent to the office and was claiming he didn't start it and it was self defense, so they called in a few people who saw what had happened and found out Generic_Name was telling the truth. This is important because if you only ask one person they can use their bias opinion to make a person or situation seem better or worse than it actually was. Another example is in football when there is a call being made all the refs huddle up to talk about their opinions on what happened during the play. This highlights the fact that when there are multiple opinions the out come is usually better and more logical.

Secondly, another good thing about seeking others opinions it can give you more options to choose from. For instance, this happens a lot in the sports world on final plays of the game. What happens is there is not much time left on the clock so they all try to figure out the best play possible to win and try to execute it. This is only useful when there is multiple opinions and plays coming in because with out different options than the one option used might not have been the best one or the most successful. To illustrate, another time having multiple opinions is helpful is when you have a girlfriend. I had the similar thing happen to me when I was dating someone because I didn't have any ideas for a date, so when I asked my friends I had much better and more ideas. All the ideas were helpful and useful and made my date worth while.

Lastly, seeking advice from multiple people is better because it keeps you closer to the people around you. An example of this is when I asked my friends for their opinion on the sport of basketball it not only made me contact them and talk to them but now they know that I am working on a report for school. This helps all of us out because know they know i'm working on my report which means I can't hang out right now and I reminded them about it and made them do it. In addition, this happens a lot when my mom asks one of our neighbors for their opinion on a certain product, but it ends up turning into them catching up and talking for the first time in a while. This helps my mom and our neighbors to stay in touch and get better opinions on products or services.

""Necklace, gift, chocolate, and flowers."" quickly states the group. While Generic_Name is still processing the information, he says, ""I think i'll just go with the necklace and flowers, but thanks for the ideas.""

7A788F9A3894,"In life people will come across many dilemmas, and seek help for their troubles.

Asking someone that they trust for advise is never a bad idea, but they have to be careful.

Sometimes, someone that he or she trusts will be biased, and not give the best advice.

Therefore, they need to ask different people.

If he or she asks many others for their opinion, they will have many options to take. Asking multiple people not only presents different points of view, but it will also help them explore more outcomes, and fully understand the situation.

Throughout the world, people go through many different things. As a matter of fact, more than 7.5 billion people live on this earth, and they all have their own problems. This is why people have their own point of view. If someone who has an issue with school went to ask a teacher for help, and asked a student the same question, he or she will get two different answers based on the individuals point of view. On one hand, a teacher might say something more sensible and optimistic. On the other hand, a student might say something more emotionally charged without giving a rational explanation. Each person they ask will present a different point of view, and along with that, a different outcome to the situation.

Different points of view will present many solutions.

This lets a person explore said solutions, and choose the best possible one. Having many options to take is a very important tool to have, and will help resolve the issue. Many problems can only be resolved when looking at them from a different angle, and the option to choose an outcome is the best way to do so. if someone is stuck on a math problem, they will never figure it out unless they take a break and look at the problem differently. This analogy can be translated as, if somone doesn't look at thier problems from a different standpoint, then they will never figure it out. Choosing the best outcome to any dilemma is the end goal, but it is almost impossible to do so, without full comprehension of the situation.

No matter how many people an individual asks, or how many outcomes they may find. The only true way to solve a problem is to fully understand it, and you do this by asking for advice. All of the points of views and the different outcomes all lead up to a full understanding of the problem. If someone doesn't understand the problem then how do they go about solving it? They ask for advice, and this is why doing so is important. It all ends up being one circle leading to a final solution to the problem.

All in all, asking for advice is the most important thing to do. It will help an individual with all of their problems if done correctly. Not only does it give you different points of views, and many outcomes to choose from, but it also leads to a full comprehension of the dilemma, and a solution to the problem.                      ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

This is because when you ask many different people that may have different opinions, you may get an answer that is right for everyone, but especially you. Keeping others thoughts in mind will help you get the perfect answer. When you ask for advice on something, you could ask many people, and maybe some of them know exactly what to say because they have been in your shoes before, and know how to answer. All these other opinions can help shape your opinion, and here are ways they can help you in the real world.

Choosing what to do can always be hard, but with more people and different opinions, you can decide what you want. Do you ever have to choose between two things and do not know what to choose? For example, when you go to the mall and you find two pairs of shoes that appeal to you so much that you just want both? But you have to pick one pair, and only one. You can ask your friends which pair they like better and get the one everyone likes better. It doesnt effect you because you liked both pairs equally and would not mind getting the one they proffered. As well as choosing between two options and using others opinions to choose something, you can use others opinions on what to choose something when there are so many more options.

On a regular basis I never know what to eat. There are so many foods that I choose from, ans so many restaurants. But sometimes I dont crave anything and just was something to eat. I dont want to go somewhere that I always go to, but I dot want to go somewhere that i have never been to and have a really bad meal. Thats why I always ask other people to help me find a place. I ask other people what they would recommend, and they give me options. They could suggest a place they really like, that I have never heard of. Or they could suggest something I know of that I havent thought about. Making decisions based on other peoples opinions is easy, and can help you choose something when there are so many options and you don't know what to do.

Lastly, I feel like this is the most important way of getting someones opinion on something to help you. When someone you know is feeling down and you do not know how to help them, you can ask other people for help on what to say or how to approach the situation . You could ask a friend, or someone you know well for advice on how to handle a situation. You want to help your friend feel better and happy but you dont know what to do because you dont what to make anything worst by saying something wrong. If you really need help and the situation is really out of control, you could go to professionals for help. Its always okay to ask others for help and their opinions so you will know what to do.

In conclusion, asking others for advice is always a good thing to keep in mind. Either if its serious or simple, asking for advice is always good. Asking multiple people and getting many different opinions on how to approach situations will make your choice on what to do better. Everyone is different and you need to understand other peoples beliefs and why they choose to do things , and with that you can use some of their opinion and put it into yours.            ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
6F9173D54DD8,"Imagine you are a high school junior anxiously awaiting your college applications. One night you get home to find three college application letters. You are accepted into all of them, your dream school, an Ivy League and your local in state university. Before making this huge decision do you only talk to your parents, your friends, your teachers, alumni, or all of the above? Believe it or not it would be healthiest to ask multiple opinions before making your final decision. When people ask for advice they often talk to more than one person. A study found that talking to more than one person before making a important decision can help create the best one. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, because it highlights diverse perspectives, provides verification of other advice and can sometimes even stop a dangerous choice.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by highlighting diverse opinions. Considering that I am only in eighth grade, I haven't yet been in charge of very large choices, however when I was entering seventh grade I had to choose whether I wanted to take seventh grade math or seventh grade math honors. At first, the choice overwhelmed me, I was worried that I would make the wrong choice. Then I started to get multiple opinions on the subject. My parents told me I could handle taking honors, my older friends told me the class had been easy, my teachers told me it would be difficult to skip a year of math. Ultimately the choice was mine, however without their different perspectives I wouldn't have been able to the best option for myself. Other people and other perspectives are a huge part of our world and our decisions affect their lives too, so our decisions should include their perspectives too.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by providing verification of other advice. About a month ago, me and my parents talked about applying to a Generic_School summer camp called Generic_School. The camp was expensive but it meant that I didn't have to take a gym class freshman year. My parents said that if it meant that I could take another elective and it would make me happy they would love me to do it. I'll admit I was a bit skeptical, until my close friend told me almost the same thing. Having multiple of the same opinions can verify other ones and make you feel stronger about a decision. A study found that people normally feel stronger about their opinions if they have been told by society that it is a popular one.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by stopping sometimes dangerous choices. Suicide prevention has found that before most people commit suicide they will exhibit signs, often by talking about suicide to loved ones. In most cases the suicide victim talks to multiple people. A recent study found that in cases where a person talks to multiple people, they have a greater chance of survival, considering someone might notice these signs. Like this, before making a dangerous choice, if you ask for multiple opinions there is a much more likely chance that you will get the help you need and create a better choice.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, because it highlights diverse perspectives, provides verification of other advice and can sometimes even stop a dangerous choice. This means that when you have a big decision, getting multiple opinions is beneficial to ultimately making the correct decision. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
3ECE3D9AD865,"Everyone has an opinion, some are helpful, yet others just are going to make your life worse. You might ask why anyone would care about someone else's opinion, well it's hard to answer that question. You see, having multiple opinions can help limit the bias from the first opinion you received. Thus, why wouldn't you want to have multiple opinions, well it's quite simple, it's because people in our world are too scared to ask for others opinion or their advice. When asking for advice you are receiving wisdom, this wisdom can guide you to many great things, or it could lead you to absolute disaster. You will be guided into doing the wrong things in your life however you could stop all of that with a bit of advice. Having an opinion from one person can be very helpful, but just imagine if you could see both sides of your problem, thus leading you to obtain enough information on your problem and make the right choice. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because wisdom from those around you is helpful, it will help limit bias, and two opinions is always better than one.

Bias, bias is a thing no one should want in the opinions they are receiving. It is never a good choice to make to accept a biased opinion as a truth. Staying away from a biased opinion will benefit in so many unbelievable ways one could be eliminating the untruthful opinions from your life. It can be very unhelpful as well, these biased opinions could lead you down a road you should not go down. You can have a very bright future awaiting for you, but the one bias opinion you listen to can and will destroy your life. You might ask how could it destroy your life in an instant, well people will look at you differently based off the one bad biased opinion you listened to, and building that former life you previously had will virtually be impossible. Avoiding the bias will help you make better choices in your life. If and only if you eliminate bias opinions from your life will you become successful and have a bright future ahead of you. There is always a bright future awaiting for everyone only if you make the right choices will you be able to achieve that bright future.

Wisdom is one of the most important things you will ever receive. Wisdom can be received or given by anyone such as your peers and elders. Everyone you meet will always have a choice to make therefore for every choice you have to make daily will effect your life forever. Some however will not be as big as others deciding what you will have fir dinner is no where as big of a decision as what you will do when your house burns down or you lose your job. Wisdom is extremely helpful because it will help you make the right choices however sometimes you will make the wrong choice. That is when those closes to you will be there for you in your times of need. Making the right choices will be very hard, yet you will always have some take aways of past knowledge of the event to help you make the right choices. Now understanding whos wisdom to listen to is up to you although your parents and your grandparents could be great places to start. These days all you here about is how others around you have the best life ever and that they've made the best choices possible however they will never share to you the wrong choice they have made. Therefore, wouldn't you want to be able to make the right choices ,well wisdom from others is a great place to start.

Having one opinion could be good, but could have bias however having multiple opinions will be even better. It you have two opinions you will be able to see both sides of the problem therefore making it easier to for you to make the right choice. Having only one opinion is definitely worse than having multiple because you are unable to have the option to see the other side. The one opinion could lead you into making some wrong choices, yet have multiple will lead to make some of the better choices that you could have made. Having the most opinions possible could change your life for the better, and possibly make your life easier. Although, receiving multiple opinions could sound easy it is quite difficult, due to the fact that nit everyone is going to want to help you. Some people in our world will not want you to succeed. However one opinion is worse than having multiple because you are unable to see everything that could be harmful towards you.

Obtaining multiple opinions for your problem is helpful for making the right choice because personal experience or wisdom is helpful, helps take away biased opinions, and multiple opinions from others is always better than one opinion. Who would care about others opinions, finding the answer will be almost impossible. Multiple opinions can limit the bias you have previously been given. Why would you even want to obtain opinions from others if they are all bad, well that's not true, opinions from others can be good for you to listen to. Wisdom form others should be a big part in the choices you make. However, you will have to be sure that they persons' opinion you are listening is trying to help you. Opinions come in two forms good and bad however you must do everything in your power to only listen to the good and not harmful opinions.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
0B084590D876,"One reason people seek different opinions is because some people have different opinions on what people should do. Seeking different people's opinions allows you to get all the information from all sides. If people seek more than one person's advice then you would be able to compare the information to see what you think is the best choice. Also, if people seek more than one person's advice then the person might be able to collect all the information and put it together.

Another reason people ask different people is because the first person may not be giving you the best advice. Like, what if the first person's advice is pretty good, but then the next person you ask has better advice. If the person asked advice from more than one person then you wouldn't have to be stuck with the bad information. If you just ask for one person's advice and it was bad advice then it could get you in really big trouble. Like, if you rely on one person's advice and they told you that if they start making you mad then you can put your hands on them. What if the person you put hands on presses charges then you could go to jail for a long time. If you asked another person's opinion then you may not be in the situation that you are in.

The next reason why people ask different people for adivce is because if the advice the person gave you worked for them, but it didn't work for you. Like, if a person is having trouble with their dog alerting them that they need to use the restroom. So that their dog doesn't keep going to the restroom in the house. They might say ""you could give your dog a treat when they alert you they need to go to the restroom"". If that doesn't work, but you only asked one person for advice. Then, you would be mad because the advice didn't work. Next, you would have to ask another person for advice, but at the beginning if you would have just asked more than one person then you would be able to peice the information together.

Finally, if people ask more than one person's advice then it will help you make the best choice possible.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

In the moment Generic_Name thought to herself, ""why did I not listen to them, I should have listened to their advice to practice more instead of slaking off at practice."" Generic_Name her instructor, ran over to Generic_Name as fast as he could, and Generic_Name said to him when he reached her, ""I should have listened to everyones advice.""

The opinions of others can be very helpful in the future. Such as opinions of helping you with something you don't understand. The opinions from others are what shape our personality/lifestyle, this is because opinions are mostly statements of what we need to do correctly or what we need to improve on. For example a man is trying to get better at something but is having a difficult time grasping what he needs, but if someone who understands the skill shares their opinion of how they understood it easier, then the man will most likey have an easier time understanding the concept behind it, and if the man is still having trouble then he can just ask others until he finds a method that suits him. To sum it up the example stated above tells us that if you don't undestand how to do something then just ask and someone will in time help you.

Opinions can also can also change the way you view your lifestyle/everyday routine. Lets say someone finds you eating or drinking something unhealthy, so they decide to express their opinion about how you should properly take care of your body and not eat junkfood because it can lead to medical issues, you could ignore it or you could listen to the harm of what not taking care of your body can do. If you listened then you would most likely stop eating junkfood and find something more healthier to sooth your cravings, so you try to find something, but nothing came to mind, but that's when you remember you have an app that lets you see everyone's opinions in catagories. I don't know why you would go to so much trouble for not even trying peoples opinions on different foods or drinks that are healthy, so lets assume you do try them, so you later get into this habit of eating it so much it turns into a daily routine. Good for you you are now eating healthy food all the time because of other peoples opinions.

Another reason why you should listen to others opinions is because they can help with what you know and don't know. If you use snapchat, intagram, and facebook then you will most likely find an opinion in the first ten seconds that your in the app, this is because the app was designed to share someone's opinions with others. If you look on the app you probably find something new and interesting that could help you in the future whithout you even knowing that you got this skill from an opinion that was off of an app. These opinions are what give you knowledge, for example we started off as caveman but then someone came along and was like,""this is not good enough,"" and created a fire, then many other world changing opinions were expressed and that led us to this point in time now. To summerize it someone learned off of someone else and then that just kept happening millions of times and is still happening to this day with the ideas on how were going to put humans on Mars.

In conclusion opinions of others can help with many problems that you are facing, can help with living healthier and better, and opinions can even help you get smarter through someone else's mistakes.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
BE6D18BAA3D1,"Generic_Name is a rising 9th grader. Generic_Name's school is having their students choose their high school classes this week, and he doesn't know what classes he should take. He wants to take all AP classes because he thinks it will help when he applies for colleges in the future. Generic_Name asks, ""Generic_Name, do you think I should take all AP classes?"" ""Yes! They're super easy and fun,"" Generic_Name exclaims. Generic_Name doesn't know a lot about AP classes, he doesn't have any older siblings and he hasn't talked to his teachers about his schedule yet. Generic_Name responds, ""Wow! Thanks for the advice, I'm definitely going to take them."" The next morning he drops his schedule off at the guidance office. Generic_Name overhears Ms. Generic_Name, the guidance counselor, talking to a student in her office. ""Make sure to only take the classes you can handle. AP classes are extremely challenging and you should only take about 2 or 3,"" Ms. Generic_Name explains. Generic_Name's heart drops to his feet, he had no idea how hard the classes were! Suddenly he gets a rush of rage and storms to Generic_Name's locker. Generic_Name yells, ""Why would you tell me the classes are easy? Ms. Generic_Name was talking about how hard they are and I already turned in my schedule!"" ""I'm sorry, I had no idea! I don't know a lot about high school and I thought they would be easy because I have all A's,"" Generic_Name says. Generic_Name responds, ""Dang, I should've asked more people about it."" When people ask for advice, they should talk to more than one person and seek multiple opinions because different people have different amounts of knowledge on topics, people have different points of view, and people have different experiences.

When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different amounts of knowledge. For example, if one person is an aspiring fashion designer and another is just an ordinary teenager, you would want to ask them both for their opinions on your outfit because they have different amounts of knowledge on fashion. Most people have a certain topic, hobby, or sport that they know a lot about, so asking multiple people for their opinions can help you make the right decision because you might find someone that has a lot of knowledge on the topic you're asking about. Another example is if someone was asking me what instrument they should choose to play, I could give them a lot of information because I play an instrument, but if they asked someone who has no knowledge on music and doesn't play an instrument they wouldn't get a lot of information. You might not know your friends have a lot of knowledge on a topic until you ask them. Simply asking multiple people for their opinions can spark a conversation in which you learn a lot about the topic.

When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different points of view. For example, if you're asking people for advice about what you should do when you have a problem with your friend, some people might tell you to go to a counselor and work it out, and some people might just tell you to talk to the person about it. When you ask different people for their opinions you can see how many people have the same opinion on a topic and how many people disagree with it. If everybody you ask about a topic has a certain opinion, but only one person disagrees, you wouldn't just go with the one person disagreeing. If you only ask that one person about the topic then you could've made the wrong choice, but if you ask multiple people for their points of view you can make the right choice and get more insight. Furthermore, when a lot of people have the same opinion on something, it is most likely the right choice.

When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different experiences. People have different experiences and their experiences can cause them to have more wisdom than others. For example, if you ask people on advice about where you should travel, you might find people who have a lot of experience traveling and they can give you their opinions and share their wisdom. If you only asked one person and that person has never even left the country, then you aren't getting a wise, reliable opinion. Another example is if you're asking an adult or a professional about the topic then they are clearly more wise because they are either specialized in that field or simply have lived longer and have more experiences in general. People who have a lot of wisdom are responsible and reliable. They'll think about the outcome of your decision and all the possible negatives, this makes them really good people to ask for advice and they'll probably choose the best option for you.

Generic_Name goes to Ms. Generic_Name's office to ask her if he could take his schedule paper back. She gives him the paper back and asks him if he needs any advice.

You should only take AP classes for the classes you're really interested in and have a B+ or higher,"" Ms. Generic_Name explains. ""Oh, that makes sense, I think I'm going to take AP bio, AP geometry, and AP world history because those are my favorite classes and I have a good grade in all of them,"" Generic_Name says.

Thank you, I would've had no idea if I didn't ask you!"" Now Generic_Name has a lot more information.

People seek multiple advice because they can get more than one answer to a problem. They do that so they can summarize and break down each advice that was given to see which works well with your problem. If someone ask you the same question, it will help you give another person some advice and help them. If you ask only one person for advice then you will barely get any information for the problem.

Pros:

It will help you give another person advice that was giving to you before

People give you multiple answers and use which one that will work out well.

It will give you a plan B if the first advice doesn't work

Cons:

They could give you bad advice and will effect you.

Before you get advice, ask someone that has experience it before or know about it. If they've never experience it before or know about it then they could give you the wrong advice or they wont know. I ask for multiple advice before and it works out well because someone gave me a lot of advice to a certain problem I had.

FD05FDCEA11B,"My footsteps seemed impossibly loud as I walked into the classroom, and it felt as if everyone was watching me. I glanced around, taking in the unfamiliar eyes staring me down.

I'm never going to fit in here.

One of the eyes turned away from me and began to speak. She formed strange sounds with her mouth in a language that wasn't familiar to me. I turned around and ran out of the room, feeling so alone, so deserted. Salty tears stained my cheeks.

A week ago, I had taken a 14 hour long flight from

Generic_City to Generic_City. It was my first time being somewhere else other than my home country, and I felt so intimidated by the new environment. Strange shapes, strange sounds, and strange people with impossibly bright hair and piercing eyes surrounded me. It was all beautiful to me - but at the same time, the most horrifying thing I'd ever seen. I felt trapped in a haze. This haze was brimming with thoughts of never fitting in, never adapting to these alien surroundings, and mostly - the crushing feeling of homesickness.

This haze pushed me down into a deep cavern, and I was encapsulated by darkness. Even though my parents tried to find me in this cavern, every search effort was in vain, until something miraculous happened. An angel, perhaps, entered the deep labyrinth and ushered me out. Her name was Ms. Generic_Name. She gave me a new perspective, a new bias. Ms. Generic_Name told me to view this unfamiliar atmosphere as something special, a new opportunity - not a hostile monster trying to swallow me whole. She told me to be glad of the change in my life. This was the first time I had ever listened to somebody's opinion and savored it in my heart. I didn't know the importance of listening to the viewpoints of others at the time. I thought

I always knew what was best; after all, nobody knew me better than myself. I took her words and used them as fuel for learning English and making friends. I thought her words were all I needed, but somehow, I was still in despair. I still struggled. So - I decided to let someone else tell me what they thought was best.

After school, I talked with my parents. I told them what I felt, that I was always alone. That I felt so, so homesick. They told me it was good to feel that way. Moving overseas was a tough thing to endure, and they said it was healthy to let myself feel down sometimes. They told me I didn't always need to pretend I was happy when I was not. These two opinions from Ms. Generic_Name and my parents shaped me as a person - I learned to let people in, and know that seeking multiple opinions is a wise thing to do. Because of this, I learned to speak English and surround myself with a group of compassionate, kind friends who guided me through my darkest times. I learned to let in my parents and take notice that they always wanted what was best for me. I learned that I didn't always know what was best, and that was okay.

I can't name all the things I've earned through listening to multiple opinions. But, I can name the many benefits of listening to multiple people. Everyone has gone through unique things. After all, our lives are not the same. What people have experienced shape them as a person, and since we're all different, some people may offer advice that's helpful to you while others may not. You'll never know if you've sought out the best advice if you only listen to one person.

If you hear multiple pieces of advice, you can learn new things, such as I did. As mentioned earlier, not everyone has gone through the same things. If someone has been through something that you haven't, it can prepare you for the future and teach you a lesson. Also, people have different biases. If you only hear one side of an argument and not the other, you can't know for sure which side you stand for. Since you don't know anything about the other standpoint, you can't make an accurate conclusion.

Finally, people have blind spots, because we're only human. One person could have partially helpful advice, and another person might have the guidance that the other was missing. If you've heard ""incomplete"" advice, such as I have, it may not help you as much as it could. If you listen to someone else's opinion, they may correct the blind spot. This would help you to the full potential.

Seeking multiple opinions is an important thing to do. When you're stuck in an impasse, these pieces of advice could be the only things to get you unstuck. Multiple opinions can help you know that you've found the best advice possible, teach you something new, and make sure you've received all the guidance you need. So, ask multiple people for their opinion. You never know what it could teach you. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
BDD65CF27087,"Many people struggle with making the best choice. Therefore, talking to other people and hearing their ideas would be a huge help! Listening to opinions from other people can help someone make the best choice because everyone has different minds, ideas and opinions from multiple different people helps to see different ways of thinking something, and those opinions help to influence the person that is in need for advice. Everyone has different ideas and opinions to help you make the right decision.

First, everyone has different minds and opinions. Therefore, not everybody thinks the same. Two different people will each have way different advice. If you are thinking of one thing, someone else could bring up an entirely different thought. You could ask anybody you know for advice. For example, you could reach out to your mom or your friends. You and someone could be talking, and they are giving you advice, but at the same time you could possibly also be helping them with speaking about your different ideas as well. There are so many people in the world, so that means that there are so many opinions and ideas. People could get really creative when it comes to giving good advice. Some people could agree to advice that is given to them, however, some people could disagree and not take the advice from them. Plus, asking other people for advice could make you two better friends, especially if you do not know them.

Next, ideas and opinions from multiple different people helps to see different ways of thinking something. One person could tell a story to you, and the other person will tell you what to do and what not to do. You should definitely speak to more than one person. Multiple people will help you see the twists in the situation. Some people could share an experience their life, or someone could share an experience from somebody else that they got advice from in the past. Who knows, someone could be in the same position as you. Meaning, they could need some advice, and you could give them your advice, and they could give you their advice too.

Lastly, those opinions help influence the person that is in need for advice. For example, the person asking for advice could start to think differently ever since the advice was given to them. People with positive opinions and advice will other people positive opinions and advice. However, you must look out for people with bad advice. Although, someone could be horrible at giving advice, but listen deeply to understand what they are trying to tell you. Thus why you must listen to multiple people in order to get the best advice in the entire world. Also, people who hear good advice from some people, will tell the same advice to other people who reach out to them for advice.

In conclusion, seeking advice from multiple different people helps to create tons of more ideas and opinions about something. People have different types of giving good advice to people. Meanwhile, if you are struggling with a choice, ask multiple different people for their advice to make the best decision. Plus, people who need your advice can reach out to you for the best advice on what choice to make. Therefore, while people are sharing their experiences and ideas, they get could get linked around so much, that the first person with that advice could get it told to right back them. The best advice helps make the best choice. It is important to talk to multiple people, and to help people the best you possibly can. The whole point is to listen to multiple people for advice. Listening to at least two people is the best way to go. Listening to the ideas of other people is always the best option when you just cannot seem to pick the best choice. It is good to listen to multiple people and then pick between their ideas if they seem good enough to you to make the best decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Firstly, having similar responses can help a lot. It sometimes prove that the advice you have been given can be a fact. When you get the same answer from different people it causes you to belive it and makes you stick with that answer.

Next, when you ask someone for advice and the answer you have received wasnt really a wise answer which you most likely wouldnt accept which would cause you to ask someone else for a good answer.

In conclusion, when people receive advice from others they may or may not receive the right answer they are in search for which would cause them to ask someone else and a smarter answer.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
078FCB89177B,"Have you ever needed advice on something that you really want to do? Asking multiple people is a big factor when you need advice. If you ask someone for advice they might only tell you the right things to do and not the bad things not to do. Everybody makes mistakes so, if you ask a person for advice that has made a mistake in that situation then, they probably will tell you what not to do. So reasons to ask multiple are important becasue,

You will be more educated,

You will be able to tell the difference from right and wrong,

And you'll Have a better chance at making the right choice.

My first reasoning is that people who talk to more than one person is going to be more educated on the subject. When you go to school and the teacher ask students about a book, some say the book was amazing and others might say it was horific. However, if you wanted to look into that book, asking students who hate and love the book is going to be important. You want to be able to know both sides of peoples opinions so you would have to ask both of the students. The good reasonings might make the book more interesting to you but other opinions might not so, this will help you decide what the best choice is going to be for you. In all getting multiple opinions will effect your choice to do something or not so, it is better to be educated than to know nothing.

Secondly, You will be able to get the opinions on what and what not to do by asking multiple people. If you want to get some advice on what classes you want to take in your future life for college, you would want to ask many people that have been in the same situation as you. Say you really want to take a buisiness class but you dont know if you would like it or not. In this type of situation you should talk to people like your teacher, parents, and maybe people that have been to college. You would probably want to know what is like so, your teacher can tell you what it is like and your parents would tell you if they liked it or not. They would tell you the pros and cons of doing that because they want what is best for you but, it is your choice. My point is that you want to ask multiple people so you know what is going to be the best choice for you.

Lastly, Asking multiple people is going to lead to you finding out the best option or choice for yourself. Say its your junior year and your finally going to get a car. You want to have the best car for you and a car to keep you safe right? Well in order to find out if a certain car is going to be perfect for you, then you should totally ask people that you know are going to give you the best option. Before anything you should ask your parents on what they would perfer or ask a near by dealership. The person at the dealership will guide you into choosing the best car for you. Your parents will tell you what they want you to have but ultimatley you have to make that choice. So asking many people will lead you into choosing the best option or in this case car but, my point is to make sure you have other people guiding you with advice, escpecially more than one person.

In Conclusion, talking to multiple people with boost your chances of making the best choice for whatever you are doing. However, always know that some opinions might be the cons and some might be the pros. Some people prefer to talk to multiple people becasue it gives them a since of what other people have done. You always want to have the highest chances of making the right choice in whatever you do so talk to multiple for advice. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5B8A26E5511F,"When asking for advice people may want to ask more than one person.

They would want to do this so they can get more ideas on what to do, have more opinions, and can help in making the best choice.

Those are only a few of the reasons asking multiple people for advice is helpful.

To begin, when asking for advice it is good to ask multiple people to get more ideas on how to handle the situation.

When you ask more people they can tell you more ways on how to accomplish what you need to accomplish.

If someone has an idea to build a chair it is good for them to ask others for advice. They can comment on how it looks and feels.

Then they can use their feedback to improve the chair.

Secondly, opinions are really important in advice.

When someone asks for advice from other people others will give their opinions on what the person should do.

They will give an opinion on what they should do.

Opinions can be a good or bad but as long as someone picks the one they think is best for the situation everything will be ok.

Sometimes people may receive some opinions that are really bad.

It's ok to not have to listen to every opinion.

Finally, asking multiple people for help can lead to making the best choice.

If more than one person is asked on what to do they can come to the best conclusion possible.

Multiple people can help someone come to the best choice by combining ideas and opinions.

For example, the chair.

If someone asks for advice on it people will give ideas and opinions.

When they are combined they can create the best possible solution.

Asking multiple people for advice can be extremely helpful.

It can give a person more ideas, more opinions, and allow them to make the best choice.

Everyone can get advice, all they have to do is ask for it.      ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B4BD4DD677AD,"One summer afternoon, a boy named Generic_Name asked his mom if he could go to the park. She agreed, but told him not to stay out too late. Generic_Name informed his dad about going out and he said to travel with a few of his friends, due to kidnappings in the area he didn't want Generic_Name to be alone at the park. Generic_Name also told his older brother about him leaving the house for a bit and he said to watch the area for anything suspicious and that if he did see something, that Generic_Name and his friends should head home immediately. Thanks to his family, Generic_Name and his friends got home safe and sound. Listening to multiple opinions can help people make safer and smarter decisions.

The first example is that multiple opinions can help you make safer choices. Like with Generic_Name, going out with people you know is a great way to stay safe. Doing things in broad daylight helps as well. Unfortunately many kidnappings and random shootings are happening presently. Following all of this advice could help a simple walk to the corner store just that much safer.

Secondly, taking in multiple opinions help people make smarter decisions too. Referring back to the introduction when Generic_Name's brother told him to survey the area and watch for any strange activity was an amazing idea. Watching for people that are acting out of the ordinary is a helpful tip, because if that person were to do something weird knowing who exactly it is your getting away from is a good thing. You also always want to know where you are at all times. It's also important to know where every exit and entrance available in any public setting.

In summary, listening to the advice of multiple people is a way to stay safe and make educated decisions. If Generic_Name were to just leave the house without speaking to his dad or brother, who knows what could have happened. The safety of you and your peers is a major priority. Everyone should get a second opinion on as many things as possible. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EBA2F18D9666,"Have you ever felt like, if I was told by there opinions to stop or to keep going, I would have stopped or been able to not give up? That has happened to me before. when I was ten years old I was at the Generic_City mall with my older brother Generic_Name, and my younger brother, by 6 months, Generic_Name. I really wanted a little surprise box from a store that we were in, but didnt have any money. I took the toy and put it in my left side of my blue hoodie and tried to acted like nothing happened. We where about to leave the store when Generic_Name saw that I had took it and grabbed it out of my hand. I got in trouble with my mom because my brother told her, but I learned my lesson. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because they will get you out of trouble, keep you safe, and you can also help others too.

First, peoples opinions can help others by keeping you out of trouble. when a person does something bad or thinks about doing something bad they might do it if they dont think straight. If someone helps them by telling them, "" Dont do that,"" or "" thats a bad idea."" They might say that they were not thinking straight and go on there day without doing that bad thing. I once told my little sister, who was about to take my mom's bracelet, to stop and put it back because my mom will get mad if she takes it. She told me no and took it anyways, my mom found out that it as gone when she came home from the store and found out my little sister took it. She got in big trouble and told me that she was sorry for not listening.

next, peoples opinion can help others by keeping you safe. someone might think bad thoughts about many thinks like, killing them self or others. If you talk to them and tell them how you feel and ow they should not do it, they won't. I watched a movie that was about a young girl who had parents that hated her, brother was a bully to her, and had no friends. She was becoming suicidal, and she was planning to kill her self. On the day she planned to do it was a day were she would be home alone because her brother had practice and her parents had work. When she went to school she saw that there was a new girl and her name was Generic_Name. She looked very shy and scared because it was her first day at school with no friends. After class she went to talk to the little girl and they stared to become friends. The little girl told her about how she wanted to kill herself and Generic_Name told her, "" No, you shouldn't kill your self, it might seem like no one likes you but they do! you nice, funny, and fun to play with."" That made her day so much she forgot about the hole thing.

Lastly, peoples opinions can help others by, you helping others. Some one that might be your friend might need to be told not to do something too. Someone you love might do something bad and you might have to tell them not to do it. You can show them that its going to be ok. You can help others by making sue there ok, telling them not to do something, or even to do something. You should always help others when they dont know what to do or if they are going to do something really bad.

In conclusion, other peoples opinions can help make better choices in many ways. If people do this, there will be less crimes, people dining and people getting hurt. If people dont do this, people everywhere will be bad it hurt. You should listen to what I have to say because this might make a change in the world and make our population grow. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
FCA553D1B819,"Have you ever took advice from your friends or people before? Getting advice from people is better than just doing it yourself. I think getting advice from people is good because you can get better information if you are applying for a new job and it will also help you from not making a stupid decision.

Getting advice from people could really help you when it comes to getting a job. You can get all the information from people who work at the place you are trying to go work for. An other reason for getting advice from people is when you have to go to school and take a test and you get advice from your teacher of what it is on and what you have to study. Advice is an other word for choice and when you make a choice you need advice. But at the same way if you donÃÂ´t use advice your choice you make may go down hill. For example iÃÂ´m a new kid that goes to school at matoaca and I just started and I dont know where any of my classes are I would go to the office and ask for advice so I can know where to go.

Back to when I said that when you donÃÂ´t get any advice your choice after that could be very bad. You could possible get hurt if you donÃÂ´t get the advice for the situation your in. For example you go with your friends sky diving and if you dont take any advice when you go you could die.

If you get advice that you really dont trust or you dont feel comfortable with, than dont do it see what other people say. But advice that you trust you dont have to worry about making stupid decisions or not having to get hurt.

At the end of the day I feel like getting advice van really help you. But not getting good advice stay away from because it could not end well. So when ever you are in a situation when you need to get advice get it from someone that you trust. Like a teacher parent or any adult.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Most of them said to use nails to build the porch when you were using screws. You tried the screws to build the porch which did not work. You use your friends advice and use nails which leads you to actually building the porch. If you hadn't asked for all of their opinions you might have never thought of using nails.

Asking for multiple opinions can also help you decide what would lead you to a better outcome. Lets say you need help with on how to greet someone. You ask multiple people to greet them with a smile or with a frown. Most of them said a smile because when someone greets you with a smile it makes you feel happy and welcome. The people that said a frown said they had a bad experience and made the person uncomfortable. You go along with the smile and end up making a new friend because you greeted them with a smile.

Asking for multiple advice may just make life easier and help you move forward. Lets say you were debating to do your homework that is worth five points. You ask your family if you should do the five point homework even though you still have basketball practice.

Seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice. It is better than just coming up with a better solution by yourself because it might never help you. We all need to talk to others and see what they think or want to say about it. If we listen to them, we will know what to do. People have different perspectives, have experience from the same situation, and knows how to help.

People have different perspectives of a choice or decision. Everybody has a different opinion since we are all different people. If you talk to multiple people, they all have different answers that can help your problem. One time, my friend was in a very hard situation and needed help. She asked for others on what to do. My friend got many different answers on how to solve it. She didn't agree with some of the people but it still helped her. After talking to a lot of people, my friend finally got an answer that she really liked. Finally, she felt so much better just because of talking to others. Another reason why we should seek multiple opinions is that some people have been in the same place as we are right now.

Some people have experience from the same situation as we might have. Many people might have been in the same place as us and knows what we should do. Studies have shown that over 60% of people worldwide has had the same problems as others. These people have dealt with the problem could help us. Reaching out to others that had the same problem will help you a lot. If you don't have many connections, maybe go to your school or neighborhood that could help. Even your friends might have been in the same position as you. Not everybody has the same exact problem but there is a chance that maybe at least one person that you talk to has. Not only do people have experience from the situation, they also have knowledge on what is best.

The last reason why you should seek multiple opinions is that people know what to do based off wisdom. Many people are smart when it comes to choices or advice. They know what to do when a problem arises and could try to solve it. Many months ago, my sister was having a lot of stress and needed advice. She was in college which is hard and gives her a lot of work. My sister wanted to talk to others since they might have knowledge on it. She went to her friends, family members, and neighbors. She got a lot of advice but none of it worked. Some advice might not help but you should still try to talk to people. Then, somebody gave her very long talk about stress and also gave her advice that actually helped. He didn't have experience from it but still knew what to do. My sister took his advice and it made her feel much better. Although some advice didn't work, my sister kept on trying and we should all do that. Many people know what to do and how to help.

All of us need to seek multiple opinions so it can help us. We should always listen to others instead of ourselves. It will help us now and could help us later in the future.

People tend to hesitate before asking someone to help them because they are not sure if they want another persons view that is contrary to theirs. Having multiple people adding and sharing knowledge is a good idea if you want to make the most educated choice. It is crucial to consult more than one person for their opinion or advice about something when you are looking for the best choice you could possibly make .

By asking multiple people for advice or an opinion you will receive helpful bits of information along the way. Each person comes from a different background, they all have their own knowledge and ideas. Consulting different people will lead to tons of information on whether you are making the best choice. One example is that publishers make authors send their books to professional editors, editors advise the authors to add some of their ideas and fix any mistakes that are shown. This goes to show that having another person that will give helpful bits of information will help make a much better decision.

Talking to more people and consulting with them for advice or an opinion leads to more ideas. Based on what the other person says you can always make a decision on whether to input their ideas into yours or if you want to disregard their idea. For example when a student is about to hand in an assignment they always have someone peer review/edit to add ideas or tell them what they think needs to be fixed. Most students do this because they want to have someone else view and improve on their work. By inputting the other persons opinions and using the advice that was given the student will turn in the better version of the assignment than what the student was about to turn in beforehand.

When you ask another person for advice or an opinion you get a new outlook and perspective each time. Each person views something differently. Having multiple view points is important if you want to see how each person inter prates what you are saying, and see whether you like the way they see it, or if you want to change it to be perceived in a different way. Something doctors do is they refer you to another doctor to get a second opinion. They do this because the other doctors may catch something that the original doctor did not catch the first time. This example goes to show that everyone has a different outlook on things and see things that some people may not see.

Whether that may be many people or just one person it is usually someone we confide in with our thoughts and someone that can confide in us to be able to tell the truth. At times, we may find it better to talk to more than one person when asking for advice. We may go to one person to get an outside opinion on the situation. By getting this outside opinion this person may not necessarily be biased to one side of the story and it gives this person a chance to be truthful. You may also go to someone who has a different way of thinking as you, someone with a different mindset. This person could bring up new points to you and new sides of the situation to open up your mind to new possibilities. There might also be someone who has a similar way of thinking as you that could help you reassure and understand your thoughts and emotions. Another reason why you may go to a different person is just to vent. By simply telling this person everything thats going on it could help you organize thoughts in your own head. You may not look for this person for advice but someone to be there to listen to you while you figure out how you want to move forward in the situation. By expressing your feelings to this one person it could help you organize and address thoughts in your own head. By asking for advice from multiple people it could help you explore different mindsets, get an outside unbiased opinion, and give you a chance to express and organize your thoughts and emotions.

At times in stressful situations or in situations where you simply need advice it may be better to talk to a distant friend or an adult who isn't exactly in the loop of things that are happening in your life. Talking to someone to get an outside opinion could help because this person doesn't know all parts of the story or maybe doesn't know everybody involved personally. This is helpful because they have no sense of bias on who is involved and what is happening in the situation. This person isn't going to sugar coat their words and tell you the truth even if it's something that you don't want to hear. They may simply listen to what you have to say and will already be ready to introduce to you new opinions and will help you look at it from a different perspective. They may tell us the truth to address the things we may be avoiding in the situation such as something that is right or wrong. This helps us because sometimes we need to hear the truth to see why we are right or wrong in these situations. By hearing the truth and possibly getting advice to move forward you get to move forward with all your facts laid out.

Another type of person that you may seek for advice is someone who you know has a different mindset than you and maybe even someone who has a similar mindset than you. By talking to someone who has an opposing mindset as yours they will be able to give you new perspectives and new ways at looking at the situation. It may not always be a positive mindset but it's good to look at the negatives just as much as the positives. This persons different way of thinking and looking at things may introduce new and different ideas on how you should move forward and how you should address the situation. You may also seek someone who has a similar way of thinking as you. Theres always a possibility of this person help you discover new thoughts and information but this person will also assure you about the thoughts youre already having and make you feel better about them. They will give you this sense of reassurance it will help you move forward confidently and effectively.

The last type of person you may seek for advice is someone who is a good listener. This person will listen to everything you have to say and will just let you vent all your emotions and that may be the only advice they give you to just vent. This person will not only listen but support you on your choices and on what you have to say no matter what. By venting to this person it could help you organize your thoughts by simply expressing them all out loud. It is likely that it may even help you come to realizations you hadn't come to before. This person is very important when going through this stressful process of not knowing what to do of getting that reassurance that everybody needs from time to time. This person may or may not be the best person for advice but they are really good of being there when you need them and listening to you when you are going through a stressful. By expressing and addressing these thoughts it could help you move forward content with your thoughts and confident on your decisions.

In conclusion, I think that by seeking more than one person for advice it helps you get the support you need to make new and smart choices. Different people that are helpful to seek advice from is someone who is more of an outside opinion because they tell you the truth and dont sugar coat their thoughts. If you seek someone who has a different mindset they will introduce new ways of thinking and different approaches you could take in the situation.

By expressing all your feelings, thoughts, and emotions you are letting someone know how you feel and getting the support you need to move forward confidently. By talking to multiple people exploring new thoughts and mindsets, getting an unbiased opinion, and being able to express and organize your thoughts you are getting set up to make good choices rationally. I personally believe that when someone asks multiple people for advice it and seeking multiple opinions it helps them be able to make smart and rational choices while being confident with their choice and content with their thoughts and emotions.                                                           ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
E1F8CC751301,"When people seek for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. The reasoning behind this is, that one person can give better advice, the other can be easier to understand, and the person asking for advice possibly wants more information from more than one person for more information.

Some people always look for the best advice from others, but some give out bad advice with no effort put in to it. ""It's always better to make a pizza with all of the ingredients"" as some say for this reason. Having more information can be better for some people in many different ways. This can possibly help someone succeed.

Other people have some trouble understanding things sometimes. So it can be easier to understand if the advice was explained in a simple way. For example, having a younger audience can be hard to explain to them in a ""adult"" form, but keeping it simple can help you get to your point with them. Even adults have a hard time understanding, just a better way of explaining things can help others.

Getting different opinions of advice is another great way to find it. You can find some pros and cons from other peoples point of view. It's like baking a cake, what are the best things to use to the worst things to use, always look for the best of it. Advice from others can help you find more of what you want.

When people seek for advice they talk to more than one person. It can possibly help someone succeed some where in life. Explaining it in a simpler way can be easier for people to understand. Or getting different opinions from others help you more. Will you find better ways to get advice from others?, or is your own advice better for yourself?",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
2FCED491B631,"When people are asking for advice, they often turn to multiple people to get a better perspective. When you ask just one person, they will usually just tell you their side of the story and how their experience was wiith that situation. People can differ and so can their opinions.

When you go to eat out at a new or fancy resturaunt you often check the reviws to see how bad or good it is. But you often check more than one or see how many of those total reviews are five star. This is just one common way people can take advice from others and learn about an experience they had. People have a different stories on their time pent there. If 8/10 people say it was bad, you would likely look somewhere else to eat. That is how it is with asking for advice. If you ask three or four people and more than half of them say it's a bad idea, you won't do it.

But you can also learn from others mistakes. If you want to try vaping and you are about to start, getting advice from someone who has actually vaped and had to deal with the addiction is definetly a useful way to deter yourself from starting. Most of the time they will tell you to stay away from it and not to try as they hate being addicted to cigarettes. It's things like these that make it important to listen to others as they give you advice. You can see that things aren't always as good as they seem.

There are also good ways to get advice on what to do. If you are falling behind on school and someone gives you advice on what to do to get your grade back up, you should probably follow it, as it can help you succeed. If you want to try to do something new like skydiving, you would ask someone who has done it to see if it is right for you. All of these things can be positive influence, from grades to finding a new activity or sports team. It is good to get multiple viewpoints to help learn and overcome fears or find a new favorite thing to do.

This is why getting different outlooks on what we want to do and getting advice on them is good for learning what you want to do. Even if it is small, it is always important to get a second opinion. You can learn more by doing it and get the right advice and help you make a more informed descision. Even I like to make sure what i'm about to do is a good idea, even when it is clearly not.

CBA9043182C5,"When asking for advice, some people talk to more than one person. They might want to do this for a wide array of reasons, but one of the main reasons is, because asking multiple people will help someone in making a better choice for themselves. This make the best choice this way because, they get different points of view, they can get advice they need, and so they don't get led the wrong path.

First, getting different points of view on something is important. It helps someone see both sides of an argument and what might happen if they choose one side over the other. By asking multiple people and getting multiple opinions on advice, someone would see what different people think about the situation they need advice on. One person may think that one thing might be better than another, and someone else might think something else is better, but by listening to all these options, someone would have a lot of options to choose from where they can make the best choice for themselves.

Secondly, different people think differently, so when asking for advice, someone would know something that they didn't before. This is the whole reason to ask for advice. Some people might not have a proper response to the advice someone needs, so asking the most amount of people for their take on things would be the best thing to do. Someone might not get the advice they need by asking one person because of this.

Finally, asking just one person for advise could lead someone down the wrong path, because that person may not have the best intent. People only know themselves the best, and don't know about what someone else might want to do. Inherently, we think that everyone will want to help us, but this is not the case in the real world. Someone might want to actively sabotage someone, which would lead to the person asking for advice to go ask more people for advice. Those new people that they asked for advice might actually give them the advice, because they might have good intent.

In conclusion, getting advise from multiple people is better than getting advice from one person. Someone will get different points of view that they might need on a situation. They get the advice they need, because many people think different way. Also, some people might want to lead someone astray by not giving them the advice they actually need. So, because of all this, someone should get advice from the most amount of people, so they can make the best decision or themselves.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
9DF9D4AC395A,"When asking for advice do you just ask one person and just go with whatever they say? Gathering more than one opinion can give you a thought process of a large variety of options. Seeking different perspectives can help you by seeing what the major number of people would do or say when asked for advice. While they are making decisions they can cause problems which then they cannot come up with a solution to fix which is why they come for advice. Usually when people ask for advice they want to know what different actions that would be a better choice to take.

Advice given usually vary because of such things like race, ethnicity, lifestyle, and many more other things that make people different therefore give different answers depending on how they see the question as. While asking for advice it is more recommended to ask many people because they can all give answers that can be very helpful to get you to have a different thinking process and make different decisions. While asking for advice the amount of people asked can be helpful or even confusing whether they give good advice and you don't know which you should take or advice given is bad and you are left unsure of what decisions to make. Advice given can either be taken or ignored, depending on the situation advice can be ignored of the person who asked thinks it is a bad idea. When a person asks for advice it can be something small like recommended shows or it can be something very serious that can heavily impact their lives.

While people are looking for advice and seek different opinions they ask for an opinion to help them make up decisions. Depending on what they are asking advice for multiple opinions can be very helpful. Having multiple opinions on a topic can lead to them having multiple choices that they would be able to take. With a variety of options they can also try to go over all advice given to choose the best one. When asking for advice there may even be a conversation debating different options that are able to be taken.

When given advice people would usually say which options they would take and those give you an idea. While going over the idea if you have some people you could take to or even just one singular person it could help them by telling them the idea the person who gave the advice had and debate over it whether it's good enough to choose. While going over other ideas as well you could vote which one seems more suited and the best option to take. Once the best option is chosen from all the other options you could have a final decision to take into action that can help you and affect you positively.

When asking people for advice you should usually ask a variety of people who'd have different perspectives on a topic for more of a larger amount of options, seeking more options to take can be useful to choose a better decision between all of them if you cannot come up with one that seems good enough.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B222F9F093CB,"Why would you possibly want to ask more than one person for advice? Well, most times when making a hard decision, you'll want to talk to more than one person about it. That's because you get to hear their opinions, which helps your mind choose the best one, create more possible reasons, and then limit it down to the best one.

First of all, when making decisions and asking for advice, you'll want to ask more than just one person. That's because you don't want to hear just one opinion because that might make you feel pressure to do whatever that person suggested. Not everyone's feedback that you receive will necessarily be great, but it may still help. Sometimes it may even be the opposite. That's why you need to collect as many opinions as you can so that you will have options to choose from so that you can decide on the best one. However, as long as you get more than one, you'll be good. When going around and asking people, you might want to ask someone a lot older and smarter than you because they've been here longer than you and may have experienced the reason why you are asking.

Another thing you should consider when asking for advice is that you'll be getting a tone of opinions so that later you can think about which one you should use to help solve your problem. Having those extra opinions on advice can benefit you in making a better choice. Depending on what advice you're asking for, it's probably best if you ask someone who has either been in the same situation as you or someone that's older and wiser and knows a lot about how to deal with problems. That way they can help you with handling the situation you're in in the best possible way and help you decide what to do about it.

Lastly, once you have all your options, you need to go back through them and choose the best one that you think will help you with your situation. Each opinion will be very different so you have to be able to pick out the one that will best suite you and will give you the best outcome to solve the problem in your situation.

Therefore, you should always talk to more than one person when seeking advice because if you ask the right person, you'll be able to get the best advice to receive the greatest outcome that will solve your problem. In that process you will also learn from the mistakes that you made along the way to help prevent them from happening again in the future.    ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
D4FF4B2AEFB4,"What are the benefits of asking more than one person for advice when making a decision? For example, a boy is challenged with the option of running for the highest leadership in his community. What shall he do to make sure that he is making the right choice? To put it simply, your average boy next door has the opportunity to be a youth leader in his community. With natural leadership skills, his parents have no doubt that we would make a good leader, but doubt still seems to be a deciding factor. Our boy is faced with doubt and overwhelming uncertainty of his options. With so much going on, he has no idea of what he should, and can do. Would you, as his neighbor help him? When people have a decision to make, consulting more than one person can oftentimes lead to the better choice. Sometimes, others can have more knowledge than you, and therefore would be a better source. Others, especially adults with more experience can even tell you possible outcomes of your decision. Seeking advice from people with experience, knowledge, and wisdom can help you make the right decision.

More than one set of eyes on a topic can be a good thing sometimes. With more people reviewing your choices they could catch mistakes, or even tell you what you could do to improve your idea or choice. For example, when I wanted to buy a new camera, I was torn between so many different options. After asking my parents, friends, and family, I finally made the best choice for my money. Even when you have a small decision to make, like what to buy for lunch, asking your friends could help you get the best option they have to offer. Even when the President is making decisions, he too has people he can ask for advice. No matter what choice or decision you have to make, asking others for advice is a healthy option.

When others have more knowledge than you, their opinions and advice can be more in depth, practiced, or even more intelligent. To put it into perspective, if you have a question on math homework, asking the teacher would be more beneficial that asking your peer, or table mate. If you want to switch classes, or change your schedule, asking a counselor, or teacher with more knowledge than you can help you make the right decision too. Even when a high school student is applying to college, they too would ask their parents for advice. Using other's experienced advice, older knowledge and wisdom can lead you down the road to the right choice.

When making a big decision, sometimes asking somebody who has done such a thing before can tell you the outcome, or give you experienced advice. If a girl wants to get contacts, she could ask her parents, family members, or teachers who have had contacts before for advice. They themselves have had it before, so they would know the outcome, and therefore would be a great resource for advice. I know that when I wanted to go to summer camp, I asked my teacher who had been there before. She knew what it was like, and could tell me all about it so I knew I was making the right decision. Even when an aspiring actor or singer wants to join the industry, they too ask those who have gone through the same process for advice, or what to expect as an outcome. Asking those with experience, or previous knowledge can not only help you make the right choice, but also tell you about an outcome that the choice might provide.

Seeking advice from people with experience, knowledge, and wisdom can most definitely help you make the right decision. So, would you help the boy next door? If you have been through what he is experiencing, would you offer him advice? It can be tough to find people, but more than one person reviewing a topic or choice can help someone make the right decision. Having other people review your decision, or asking multiple sources can sometimes help you make the right choice. Even asking more experienced individuals can help too. When asking someone who has more in-depth knowledge, or is wiser, you can receive advice that you wouldn't have thought of. Even when making a big decision, like our boy next door, you can ask people who have done such things before. When asking those who have experienced first hand the choices you want to make, you can get opinions or advice from more experienced individuals. When you ask others for help, advice, or opinions, you have the chance to dive into a world of possibilities. When asking more than one person, you can experience even more possibilities. Asking other can give you the best help you may ever receive.                ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
E680D448BBA4,"Everyone always say ""listen to your heart"" but getting opinions from others on a topic is better then thinking of ideas yourself. Advice is really helpful for people who have a hard time making decisions and people who struggle to think of somethings on there own. I think that seeking multiple opinions is a good options because it can impact your decision on a topic, you can compare both of the different view points, and you can combine all off the contrasting ideas to create one big and great thought.

Peoples advice can change your perspective on a certain topic. When thinking of what you will eat for dinner to deciding what college you want to go to, just one person can change you mind on your decision. I am going into high school next year and picking out my classes is extremely difficult and not easy to go through alone. Thats why I be sure to ask my parents and close friends ""Should I take honers biology?"" or ""What electives should I take?"" I get there opinion on what I should do and it really helps impact on me making a better choice.

Whenever I have a hard decision to face I usually get multiple opinions and compare my ideas to theirs. I ask my mom, dad, sister, and close friends how they feel about my viewpoint. I then take what they say into account and compare all the the different viewpoints to find the flaws and specialties about them. This is a great method for me because everyone has a different opinion on somethings and hearing what other people have to say about my topic really gives me a lot of perspective when deciding.

Getting a numerous amount of different kind of viewpoints, it can be a lot to handle and take in, but adding all the good word from your peers can help you make one good decision. For example your faced to decide what book to get for your English project. Your best friend says you should get a fiction book but your mom says you should get a book about dogs. Your probably saying ""Always listen to your mom!"" but instead of throwing out your friends idea you can combine the two opinions and wined up getting a fiction book about a cute little dog.

I do believe that seeking multiple opinions is a good option because it can impact your decision on a topic, you can compare both of the different view points, and combine all of the opinions to get one big idea. So what if your faced with a decision you dont know how to handle it. These three different ways can help you when coming to make hard, frustrating, and confusing decisions. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
2A4C1A1AD665,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Explain why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Use specific details and examples in your response.

Sometimes when asking for advice, people talk to more than one person because it is difficult to get proper reassurance with only one person's opinion, a person may favor somebody else's opinion, rather than the first person they asked, or sometimes, others simply lack honesty. Many people like to see what others think about them, rather it be a new look, or needing guidance in a difficult situation. They may also be seeking reassurance, to make sure others think they handled a situation the correct way.

From time to time, people may seek reassurance from others, as it may be hard to give themselves that relief of knowing what they did was right. It is easier to be reassured by multiple people, rather than one, because a group of people is more likely to think of more different ideas, than an individual person. One person may tell somebody that they look good, or they did well at something, just because they wouldn't want to hurt that person's feelings. In contrast, a group of people may agree upon recommendations, or could even help the person, depending on the situation. Also, if a person is in a tight situation and asking a group of people for their opinions, somebody in a group may think of a response nobody else had thought of. Since multiple people will most likely have different ideas, a person may like somebody else's opinion, rather that the opinion of the first person they asked.

If somebody needs a quick response to their concern, they may ask a person near them, whether they deeply know the person, or don't know the person at all. Sometimes, in the moment, people need fast advice, although the advice may not necessarily be the best. This ""fast advice"" can make people feel better in the moment, but they still may not fully believe what the person had told them, especially if they don't have a connection with that person. This can cause the person seeking advice to ask other people what they think, just to be safe. If somebody asks other people the same question and gets a different response, they may value the second or third person's opinions, rather than the opinion coming from the first person they asked. For example, when going to get seen by a doctor for an injury, people may have multiple consultations for treatment, then choose which treatment plan best suits them. Therefore, having multiple valued opinions can help somebody make a decision that fits the situation, but also fits that person's own needs.

Trust is a big factor in terms of feeling safe. If a person doesn't trust somebody, they're not going to value or put much meaning to what that person tells them. It is a good thing to seek multiple people's advice because at times, somebody's biggest concern may not be being completely honest. Many people have been asked for their opinion, yet, they may not tell the truth. People have trouble telling the truth to people at times, simply because they worry that they may hurt that person's feelings. A lot of times, the thought process of the people that are lying is more along the lines of trying to be kind and respectful, rather than giving a fully honest opinion. Although some people might not tell the truth, others most likely will, if asked. Since honesty is a key component of trust, honesty is valued far more in rough situations, than just being nice.

If somebody asked only one person their opinion, it would be impossible to get a group's majority. As mentioned in the second paragraph, a majority of people can bring far more reassurance than one person. This can help somebody make better decisions, since there are other people that have examined the situation as their own, and have given thought out advice. As well, it is often a good feeling to somebody, knowing that multiple people acknowledge and care about them. People like when they have not been lied to, because it shows a relationship of trust. Trust can play a big factor, in terms of advice, because a person will not be able to believe other people's ideas, if they can't rely on the person. In conclusion, asking a group of people for advice can lead to different recommendations, an increased sense of relief, and ultimately, making better decisions. At the end of the day, it is important to ask others for advice because people have to make their own decisions. Sometimes it can be extremely hard for people to decide which path to take. Therefore, seeking advice from multiple people is a better way of guidance, and can lead people to make more effective decisions.           ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
25B15676D65B,"Has there ever been a time in your life when you didn't know what to do and needed advice? When you asked someone something did you only ask that person or multiple people? There are some people that only ask one person. But I will explain why asking multiple people is better than asking one specific person. That is because getting different point of views allow different feelings and understandings, you find out things you never knew,and you get to learn about that person.

My first reason, is you get to see different point of views which allow you to feel and understand that person better. Different point of views help some people get through things and helps others get to the right place. As you learn it makes you want more to learn. But learning that much takes time.

The next reason, you find out things you never knew. Finding out new things can be scary as well as exciting, but that is a part of different views. Some people hate finding out new things because their scared of what is is. An example is if a family of four found out that their mom has a third child the family would be devastated at the fact of another child they knew nothing about. But there are just somethings people have to learn to except.

The last reason, you get to learn about that person. Learning about new people is always exciting. You can make new friends, and your friends can meet new friends. But meeting new people is still hard because you don't anything about them. Also when you try to learn about them they can get defensive. Some people hate their past, but they need new people to be friends with to forget about their past.

The conclusion of this is different point of views can help people in a lot of ways. You can meet new people, find out things you never knew. But the important thing is how you can see different point if views for advice. And advice from more than one person is a good thing. So make sure to ask multiple people about something to get different angles of that thing",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
3206E3F5CA39,"When looking for advice its better to talk to multiple people. Talking to more than one person for advice can benefit you more . Getting advice from multiple people gives you a more opinionated and/or correct answer , which helps you make better decision. Only talking to one person for advice is less beneficial then talking to more than one person , because your most likely going to get better and smarter advice if you get advice from multiple people

Talking to more people gets you different advice from different people. You get peoples opinion , which you may or may not agree with . You also get different perspectives and you can combine those perspectives and opinions together for better advice. For example your best friend is very mad at you and you do everything to make them forgive you , but nothing works so you go to other friends for advice. They give you advice you have already tried so you go to your mom, and she gives great advice , but its not enough so you go to your dad who also has great advice. So you combine your mom and dads advice together and use it on your best friend it works and you guys get closer. Using multiple opinions, perspectives, and advice can help you make better choices as can combining them.

While you may want to get a lot of other peoples advice on something you may not agree with it. Everyone has their own beliefs , opinions , and ways of giving advice. So you may not like what everyone says but its best to listen because you never know if they can change your mind on how you think of something. You can learn a lot from other people and their thoughts which benefits and improves your thinking on things. This improves your decision making and thinking for future problems. You should always listen to others opinions and thoughts because you can learn from them.

Getting only one persons thought on things isn't as beneficial as multiple opinions on something. When you hear other peoples opinions and advice you may use it to use on your own problems. Other opinions and thoughts you may not agree with can also benefit you in a way , because your listening to other thoughts different from yours. Expanding your knowledge and thinking smarter when solving problems , because when you put two ideas together it helps you make better choices.     ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
84D2A6C75C67,"Talking to more than one person for ideas or advice is very helpful for many reasons. It may help you understand different sides of an argument for example. Or you may even get more, or different information from different people. Everybody thinks differently, and the more people you question on a subject the more unique answers or ideas you would get. That is why I would think talking to more people for advice or for any subject, is better than only talking to one person, or no one at all.

A big reason I personally, and from experience think getting more opinions on is when you get into an argument. Not all arguments are about settling an aggravated dispute. Some arguments begin by at least one person disagreeing with another persons idea. This is not a bad thing. If you were in an argument and you thought you were right about something, ask a friend or somebody what they think. They may prove your side of the story, or they may even change your mind and explain why you were wrong. Doing this can be a good way to understand whole different sides of stories that you may not have even considered.

Another reason for talking to a lot of people for something is to get ideas. Businesses do this all the time to invent new products. A bunch of people may get together and decide they wanted to make a new brand of car. Instead of one person thinking about the idea, everybody in the business may suggest something like what to call the car,how wide the car should be,how many they should make, or where they should sell the new car. The more brains and perspectives you have, the more you can accomplish.

The final reason to ask people for their opinions is to gain information or techniques. If you were trying to grow a garden and all of your plants were dying, it would be smart to ask a farmer what to do. Or even go online and look up the reason all of your plants were dying. You could even find out that you were watering your plants to much, or that the plant you were trying to grow needed shade. Even learning techniques from another person would be an excellent idea. If you need help with something there is also people around to question or get information from.

If you put everything together, asking people for help or for advice is a very good option. It can help you in so many ways, such as being in a business or growing a garden. As a plus their is not a lot of downsides to asking for help. This will help you settle arguments or gain information.                                    ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
7F2C3D877C97,"Do you like to ask people questions, or do you like to stay quiet?

Honestly, I stay silent, but asking people for their opinions is a terrific idea.

When I say people, I mean at least 10 people. Why you may ask, well i'll enplane.

I think asking people for advice, or asking more than one person is a good idea for these exact very reasons, having more than one perspective gives you better options, some peoples ideas can be better than others, some people have weak opinions, and also you could vote on it.

Firstly, It's better to have more than one perspective on your question before yo answer it.

If you do this you are less likely to make a choice that is bias.

What I mean is that if you only go with your choice you'll seem selfish.

Being bias, in this scenario, is not as good as a idea as you think it would be.

Maybe your idea wasn't the greatest, if you would to have asked multiple people you would have gotten more choices to pick from. For me, it's always better to have more choices. This is why you should ask more than one person for an perspective or an opinion.

Second off, some peoples ideas are better than others.

Most likely, if you asked multiple people the same question, they will have all sorts of different answers.

Most would probably be better than others.

If you only ask your best friend or co-worker they might not have the answer that you truly need, but you'll still listen because you only got only 2 opinions, theirs, and yours.

So if you get more than just one persons opinion you'll have a better chance of doing something better then you thought.

Some times people have weaker opinions than others.

If you ask someone with a weak opinion on your question they will probably give you a random or odd answer, because they might not know what they are talking about.

Others will have a strong opinions, but you'll never know unless you ask them,.

Instead of asking one person who might give you a good answer or a bad answer, ask a group of people because you'll get some good and bad opinions for your question.

Its always a good thing, in my opinion, to ask instead of assuming that someone has a strong opinion on your question.

Finally, you can make a vote or a chart.

You can make a vote or chart out of everyone you asked opinions.

If you asked 100 people the same question they'll give you different, and same answers.

If people chose the same answer multiple times than that is probably the most common answer. Depending on what the question was, that could be a good or bad thing.

If you can never make your mind ask people, and than record you answers to see witch answer is best, and then they would technically be voting or you could make a chart.

You'll get more than one perspective from people.

Some peoples ideas a re better than others.

People have strong and weak opinions.

You can make a vote from the answers.

B541C87764FC,"When people ask for advice they usually ask for advice in different areas like say you need help with a babys name you wouldnt know, thats why you need different opinions from your family, friends co-workers, people that care about you , people that would give you a great opinion or in this case , a great name to name your newborn baby.

Once you have a problem in mind that you caant seem to figure out and have trouble with, you tend to get a little hasty and you have to go around your friend group etc and get different opinions from everyone.

Different opinions are a great way to make the right decision, if you get bad opinions you can get the wrong idea and make a bad decision thats why you need to be careful who you ask and how you ask for an opinion.

More than one opinion, and both times they are the same opinion you are more likely to be right or make the right decision the first time than get a bad opinion and be wrong all the time.

In conclusion different opinions are a great way to make somehting happen, or make a right decision and have a great outcome, and having a bad opinion can lead you to a bad oucome and worse answers to your problem.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2

Nothing is worse than a problem that requires you to choose between multiple things. Sometimes you need a little guidance so you can stay on the right course. We can't view asking for help or advice as a weakness. We first need to observe the benefits. Wisdom, different perspectives and satisfaction are all reasons why seeking multiple opinions is so great.

Wisdom plays a big role in decision making.

There are people that have been through what you are going through, and can give you sound advice. This advice can be better than normal advice because not only do they understand the situation, they probably know what you've been going through on top of that. These people have learned from mistakes they have made, and know how to avoid them. Seeking an opinion from someone with experience will always be a sound decision.

We often count out people with opinions that aren't similar ours, but we fail to realize the reason for varying perspectives.

When faced with a decision to make, no matter how small, our judgment can become clouded.

To another person who isn't dealing with that problem at first hand, things look a little clearer for them.

They can provide an unbiased opinion that you probably needed.

These people can also open you up to ideas that you hadn't even considered.

When it's all said and done, sometimes we don't end up with the outcome we would have preferred. But knowing that you tried the hardest you could and exhausted every possible resource leaves you with a slight satisfaction. Seeking out multiple opinions may not have gotten you what you wanted, but you can move forward with this new information feeling better about yourself, and better about the future.

With all this new information, you can now face your problem head-on and know just what to do. We've established that there are a multitude of benefits to seeking multiple different opinions.

Wisdom, different perspectives, and satisfaction.

Its now up to you to decide if utilizing this info is in your best interest. Making decisions can be tough but that's just my advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
4EF56F42107E,"People sometimes talk to multiple people when seeking for an advice. If we only ask one person, then that person might not be correct. People tend to trust the most when they ask for more than one person's advice. And also, if we ask multiple people for an advice, we can see what their viewpoints are and what they would do in different situations. When asking for an advice, it is more efficient to ask multiple people to ensure if what one person said was accurate, it gives us a variety options to choose from, and we can combine some advises to form a better one.

The first reason in which asking more than one person for an advice is better is to ensure that if what one person said is accurate or not. If you are not sure of what one person said as an advice, you can ask other people to check if what they said was true. For example, if you ask a friend on how to handle a problem and you think that what they said wasn't accurate or good enough, then you can ask someone else for more credibility. If you do not ask more people, then you might get the wrong advice. The solution you think is correct will actually be inaccurate and instead of making things better, you can make them much worse. You can ask different kinds of people of different ages to see what most people think. You can't do that if you only ask one person or just ask the same type of people.

Another reason that it is better to ask more than one person for an opinion or advice is that it gives us a variety of options to choose from. If we only stick to an advice that one person gave us, then we will only have to take that advice, not knowing if it was accurate or not. Having only one option to choose from can sometimes be better for indecisive people, but it is better to have more options to choose from most of the time. Having more than one option is better because you have the control over the situation. If you ask one person you will have to take that advice without knowing what other great options are out there. Finally, if you have more options to choose from, you can imagine the outcome of each of those options and see which one is the best one. Plus, it is sometimes fun to try new things that have a different outcome.

The last reason in which multiple opinions are better is because you can combine some advises to form a better one. If two people say different things and both of them make sense, then maybe you can combine them to make the better choice. This also helps you with your creativity of combining things to get a better outcome. Combining advises is the best option for indecisive people. Instead of choosing between two options, they can just do both but combined. If someone gives you an advice that you would never take, but it looks like a good advice, then you should combine both. It is never bad to take positive risks, you should try something new everyday.

In conclusion, it is more efficient to ask multiple people for an advice to make sure if what one person said was true or not, you can have a variety options to choose from, and you can combine some advises to form a better one. If you ask multiple people for an advice, then they can encourage you take an action that you never took before. You should also combine advises because two brains are better than one. Different kinds of people's viewpoints can be better to try something new or just to have different perspectives with different options. When asking for an advice, you should always ask multiple people for their opinion.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
AB8EFBD82820,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Since they might need help, and they might try to get the most advice possible. I think taking advice from others is really helpful. Three reasons why I think seeking advice can help are new ideas, different mindset, and you can help others.

One effect of taking advice is new ideas. So, what i mean by this is you may have different look on things. math for an example you might be confused on how one person teaches it, but then go to a different person and they teach it a way you understand it. Also, it doesn't have to be about school it can be maybe your having a ruff time at home or something is going on in your social life.

Another reason is you can get a new mindset. Lets say if you were really negative and you went to go seek advice from from therapist. Then you can have a new mindset on how life is and possibly become more positive. Since now that the internet is a thing you can get advice on almost anything. I remember this one time in my life how i was really negative, and i went to someone for help and now i'm more happier then i have been.

My third reason is you can help others. I know what you might be thinking how does this have anything to do with taking advice from someone. Just let me explain. So, lets say if anyone of your friends is having a ruff time and you can give that said person advice. Also you can be a therapist yourself or a life coach. Thats the wonderful thing about the world. You can get advice and give it too.

Mots people usually ask for advice, and they will most likely go to more than one person. Sometimes a person might need help, and so they go to the most advice they can get. I think taking advice from others is helpful. The reason for this is you can get new ideas, a different mindset, and you might be able to help others yourself.       ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
FF6E114981D0,"People ask for advice on a daily basis, But is asking more then one person to much advice. You need more then one persons advice for different things and everybody has an opinion on different things so you should as multiple people for any advice you need. There can be people who agree with you and who dont agree with you so its always good to know both sides of the story.

Lets say you want a new pet so you ask 5 of your friends what you should get between a puppy and a grown dog, You might want a puppy but not all your friends might agree with you,3 out of 5 friends say you should get a puppy because it is energetic and you can see it grow and it will be loyal to you because it has been your puppy for along time,2 out of 5 friends say you should get a grown up dog because it will be trained and it will not pee in your house as much as puppies do,both sides of your friends gave very good advice so now you can think about what you really want.

Getting advice from more then one person like you mom and from your dad you can ask them how a dress looks on you,your mom will know what to look at like how your body looks in it how it fits you all these things but you dad on the other hand wont say as much as your mom he might just say it looks nice without really looking at every little detail on your dress.

9A5D8C898877,"Have you ever needed advice and one person is not enough to help you so you should for sure have multiple people giving you advice it would surely be enough to help you. I believe that people should have multiple people helping them because they can give you better advice because they so much ideas that different people have. Therefore, you should for sure ask for more people to give you advice If before you only asked one person. I say that because of these three reasons They can give new ideas, you can make better choices, and there is different points of view.

One reason that you should ask more people for advice is because they can give you more and new ideas. I say that because if theres different people with different minds then others they can surely give you and idea you never thought about. I know this because it happened to me before I was very mad because my parents did not buy me a toy. Then I asked many different cousins of what should I do to get that toy and many said be good or others said just dont get it and that gave little me so much to think about that I never even thought of before so that helped me because I got much more things to think about then just constantly wanting that toy. Also even researches say that 80% of people who ask for advice to many people get better outcomes. There is no reason for you to only ask one person if you get so much good things to ask more.

The second reason I say that multiple advice is better then only one is that you can make better choices. Lets say that you need help on what to spend your allowance on and you have two things that you like but you can only get one. Would you want one person to help you with deciding which one to get or multiple people giving you feedback so you can make a good choice. If you would only want one person to help you let me tell you why thats not a good choice they could easily think for what they would love to have and not what you would love to have. For example lets say the two things is a dog and a cat they could easily be a dog person and just say dog but if there was multiple people they would give you reasons on why you should get the dog. Even research that a lot of scientists have found that is that 75% of people who ask for multiple people for advice makes better choices.

The final reason on why you should ask multiple people for advice is that there is more points of view. This is a lesson that I learned before too because this has happened to me before. One time I was devastated that my parents would not let me play video games. Eventually, I asked my parents themselves on why i'm not allowed to play video games and they said think about it this way what if you were the parent would you let a child that has school tomorrow and it is passed his bedtime play video games while he has not been on his best behavior. That gave me so much made me learn so much things the whole time I was looking from my point of view while I should have been looking from both of my parents point of view.

In conclusion sometimes one opinion can be better then one if the one person knows you very well. Although, in most cases more minds is better then one. Those three reasons clearly show that multiple people giving you advice is better then only one. Therefore, the next time you need advice try asking more then one person it could seriously make a difference. There is literally no reason on why you should ask one person for advice if you ask a lot more it can't make things worse for you it can only make things better for you.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B962DFFBD558,"Seeking opinions can help you make better decisions. ""Two brains are better than one."" See now everyone has heard this quote at least one time in their life. And that's because it's true! Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because, more minds the better, different people from different cultures can have other ideas. And also it's good to have conversations about something that you're not sure on.

More minds the better. You know all those tall buildings built in the city? Yeah, those took many minds to make, over 1,000 engineers worked on the worlds tallest building. What if only one engineer made the design plans? I bet you it wouldn't even get past the drawing board. Everyone has heard the ""We're stronger together"" or ""Team work makes the dream work."" Now, do you know everything about airplanes? I bet not, so that's why you would talk to someone that does know something about planes. 99% of engineers need someone else to work for them because they don't know something. See, that's a perfect example of a way that we need other people to help us by using their knowledge that they have and that we don't. But overall everyone is better together and not better divided.

Different people from different cultures can other backgrounds and ideas. You may think that one word is good, but then your friend from a different country might think that that word is horrible! See now no one person is the same so that's why sometimes if you have and opinion on something then maybe you should ask someone else that has a different cultural background from you. One thing that famous politicians do is check with other people with different backgrounds to make sure that they don't offend people when they don't want to. Before you go out and start blabbing on about some other country maybe you should try and talk to the people from that country so then you don't offend them? You as a person will never be the same than anyone else. I personally have friends from other countries that eat dogs but look here, in the USA if someone eats a dog, that is very illegal. That's a perfect example of how people with other backgrounds will differ in opinions. So as you've read, most people that are different from you will widely differ in opinions from you.

It's good to have conversations about something you're not sure on. Everyone that is successful right now has asked at least one person for help, I can guarantee you that. So if you need help just ask! It's one of the best ways you can get help anyways. There are over 1,000 different information data bases that can help you find information on anything. One that I like is Wikipedia it may not be 100% reliable but that's only if you're ignorant while reading it. Wikipedia has over a million topics of information that you can browse. See this may not seem like your asking for help but it is one way you can. I only listed one good source of information but overall there is hundreds of sources for information and you can get help from any of them.

But the best you can do is always seek for more information and keep on learning. That's why more than one person's advice is better only one person's advice. So I challenge you to go out into the world and to keep asking questions and to stay educated!",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
4779C9C9093F,"When you seek for different opinions do you ask multiple people? A study shows that when people ask multiple people for different opinions for a certain thing they make a better choice then not asking anyone for their opinions. This happens because not everyone has the same opinion on a certain thing, the certain individual that they are asking has been through that same situation, and you get multiple opinions and you pick the one you think its right.

Its better to ask multiple people for their opinion because not everyone has the same opinion on a certain thing. For example, lets say that a student was asking her friends if she should take a job or not and more than half said yes and the other people said no so, shes probably going to go with the answer with the most votes. Also, there is billions of people in the world and they have similar but not exact opinions on a certain thing or situation. It is also better to ask for different opinions because every single person in the whole wide world as a different mindset and different ways they will solve their problems and they also have different knowledge over a certain thing.

Many people ask multiple people for their opinion because that certain individual that they are asking has been through that same situation. It is sometimes very common for someone to has had or has the same problem or been through that situation. For example, my friend ask me for my opinion for a certain situation and turns out I had been through that same situation or problem. There for, I helped her solve her problem and helped her make a better choice. Also, when you find a individual or person that has or has been helping you solve that situation, they sometimes can help you through life because you and them might have a similar mindset of solving a problem or situation.

Seeking for multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because you will get multiple opinions and you will pick the one you think its right. It is proven that when you have different options to pick from you will pick the one you like the best or the one you think it is right. For example, lets say that someone had the chance to pick anything from a box of expensive items, they will probably pick the one that is appealing to their eyes or the one that it is more visible to their eyes. There for, it is the same thing that happens when you ask multiple people for their advice for a certain thing because then you will pick the one you like the best.

In conclusion, people ask multiple people for their advice for a certain thing or situation because not everyone has the same opinion on a certain thing, the individual that they are asking has been through the same situation, and you will get multiple opinions and you will pick the one that you think its right.          ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5BC187A4FE09,"Boom! It's picture day and you can't decide which dress to wear! You pick out your two favorite dresses, and quickly ask your family members which one they enjoy best. Most of them agree that your pastel, lavender dress would best fit your spring pictures. When you take the pictures and get them back they look amazing! Due to the fact you asked multiple people for their opinion on your dress, you managed to get magnificent pictures. That is why I believe getting multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Doing so can help you improve on certain things like essays, help you make a difficult decision, and assist you from making bad decisions.

First of all, getting multiple opinions can help you on certain things like a math problem. Lets say the question was difficult and don't think you got the correct answer, so you ask others and see if they got a similar answer. If they don't you can see where you or maybe the other person went wrong and get a better grade! Another way it can help is letting other people read your essay. If you let multiple people read it, they might catch certain things you didn't see before. They might see things like spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. For example, I let my father, my step-mom, and friends read the stories I write to see if I made any mistakes.

Also, if you ask multiple peoples opinions it can can help you with a difficult decision. Going back to the example in the first paragraph, you didn't know what to wear for picture day. So, you asked your family their opinions on what to wear because you couldn't decide. With asking their opinion they helped you choose and prevented you from struggling. Also, you might be choosing a new backpack because your old backpack broke, so you go out to buy a new one but can't decide which one to choose. Instead of standing there for hours you ask your friends their opinion and now you have a brand new backpack you love. A personal example is I couldn't decide what jacket to wear, so instead of sitting there for hours I messaged my friends and asked for their opinion. Their opinion made me able to go out and enjoy my day sooner than sit there debating which jacket to use.

Lastly, it can help you from making a bad decision. If you don't know what clothes to wear in cold weather, you can ask others what clothing would best suit the weather. Their opinion helped you go outside in warm clothing than walking outside in clothing that is meant for warm days in below-freezing weather. Or maybe your sick but don't think your ill enough to cancel the days plans, so you ask others for their opinion and they all agree your much to sick to go out. For example, one day I didn't feel well but thought I wasn't feeling ill enough to stay home from school, but I asked my family and they agreed I was much too ill to go because I was running a 100.1 degree fever. Due to the fact I asked their opinion I prevented the possibility of getting others sick and spreading my illness.

Seeking multiple opinions can certainly help you make a better choice. It has helped me and many others do excellent on certain things, prevented us from embarrassment, and kept us from making a bad decision. I understand sometimes it can be hard to seek others opinions and may be a little scary, but I believe it can and will help you make a better choice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

When people listen to someone's advice and it helps them a lot through life, it makes the speaker feel good about themselves. It makes the speaker feel like a positive adviser. It makes people to tell everyone advice. One person to tell everybody advice. Then those people who listened to the advice becomes more successful in life and spreads more advice to everybody else.

Fear is something everyone has. Whether if it's a fear of heights, a fear of roller coasters, and any other fears or phobias. I always wanted to learn how to do a back flip, but I was scared that I was going to land badly. I was scared that I was going to land on my neck and break it. So I asked my friend that does flips and told me how to get over it. He is a professional at acrobatics, so I listened to his advice. Then the day after, I finally did a back flip. Now I can do a back flip without any problems. My little cousin saw me doing it so he wanted to know how to do it. I gave him the same advice that my friend gave me. So my little cousin listened to it and landed it to. I felt proud of myself. I thought that I could help more people of getting over their fears.

Depression is a thing everybody goes through in life. Some people also talk about how to get over depression. People want to tell people about their story of when they felt sad or lonely and how they managed to get over it. When people relate to things, that's when people get the advice the person is talking about. It's easier to talk about things that people can relate to when you are trying to give advice.

Moving to a new school can be stressful. You have to make new friends. The school is a lot more different than your old one. You can talk to other people that go to your new school and ask them how get along with people you don't know. They can probably relate because they were probably new to the school as well. They can probably tell you their stories on how they made a new group of friends and got along with more people.

When you received advice from multiple people, you can use their advice to help other people. People always have an obstacle that they are trying to get over and try to to give that person advice.

A222836421FE,"What do you do when you need advice? Many people tend to ask others such as their friends, family, teachers, etc. The real question is, should you ask only one person for advice or multiple people? Asking multiple people for their opinions can help you make a better choice as people have different views and beliefs, personal experience in what you want advice for, and you have different people telling you their opinion so you can consider the best option.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, because many people have different views and beliefs. Nobody is the same, and the world is a very diverse place. Many people are biased, and if you were to ask somebody who is biased for advice, they would give you their personal opinion which could be on the far right or far left of the spectrum. Everybody was raised different. Some grew up in poverty, some rich, and some in segregated communities. The way you were brought up is also a factor to your opinions and asking just one person may affect your decision based on their opinion.

The topic you need advice on may have also happened to other people. People have personal experience in some of the same topics, and that's why it's good to seek multiple opinions. Tragic events happen to people everyday, and that's a factor in what can affect people's opinions. For example, women who have had a baby may have a different opinion than a childless woman. People are also very educated. If you needed advice on a medical topic, it would be best to go see someone who has a degree and is experienced in the field. If you were to go to your friend who self-treated them self, he or she may tell you something completely different than an experienced person in the medical field may tell you.

Multiple people telling you their opinions gives you a wide range of options to consider as they all have gone through different things in life. If it's a personal topic, it's best to ask many different people from different races, religions, and others as you'll hear many different opinions and maybe even hear something you've never thought about that you may consider.

Overall, it's best to ask multiple different people their opinions on a topic you need advice on. By doing that, you'll hear many different opinions and it'll give you a long list of options to consider as you are hearing opinions from people with different views and beliefs, personal experience, and from people who may be completely different than you.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B81F8D4BF791,"Is it better to go to more than one person for advice? Making decisions can be scary, and so we often ask other people what they were to do if they were us in the situation. It gives us clarity. Seeking this advice from multiple people can give us different points of view, can help you get a variety of different opinions, and may even help you realize that there was no problem at all.

In order to make a better choice, you need to know both sides of the problem. Asking different people can help you see different points of view. One time, my friend was mad at me; I didn't know what I did to upset her. So I went to a few of my other close friends and asked what I might've done to aggravate her in the first place. After I was done walking them through what happened, they explained to me what I had done to upset my friend and helped me see what I could do to fix it. If I had not gone to multiple people I may have never seen the other side of the story.

Going to talk to more than one person gives you a lot of different advice. That is why it is so good to talk to more than one person. If you like a dress but you don't know if you completely love it and ask some friends if they like it; Then you get six people who love it and two who don't. Having all those different opinions on the dress can help you make a better choice.

""Admiting you have a problem is always the first step"" they say. Well what if you dont actually have a problem. That's why asking three or more people for advice on a problem may help you see there was no problem at all. Though some people feel that asking three or more people can make decision making very difficult. Just keep in mind that advice from different people is very helpful.

In conclusion, asking someone for advice can help you make the best decision. It can give you the clarity to make the right choice. The benefits of asking multiple people are you get different points of view, you get a variety of opinions, and may make you realize you never had a problem at all.               ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
6D7A4D514692,"Have you ever felt confused? Have you ever felt like you were in the dark about something and couldn't figure out what to do? Whether it be through a tutor, a friend, or a family member, you may have asked more than one person for help or advice to solve a problem. They may give you bad advice, great advice, or maybe change your mind about something. This is why asking multiple people for advice can help you make a better choice because it can broaden your mindset, people may have more experience, and you can view more than one side.

First, advice from multiple people can help broaden your mindset. You may find yourself seeing the situation in a more serious or less serious way, and may find an easier way of how to deal with it. The fact that you have heard more than one opinion means that you can prepare if the situation somehow changes, which brings us to our next reason. Next, you can switch plans if the decision ever arises. Only one person could probably not give you all the advice you need, so more than one persons ideas could help you come up with a back-up plan to get out of a predicament that you may have not seen coming. Finally, you may change opinions about how to deal with a similar situation in the future, whether it be preparing for a big speech, or simply taking a small quiz. If after everything is taken care of, and you tell yourself ""I could have done it better"" or ""I didnt like the way I dealt with that"", you could form your own opinion or make your own advice to give out of your own experience and everyone elses.

Second, asking more experienced people may help you find a much easier way to deal with future problems. First they may offer more helpful advice. They may have been in the same spot you were in many times, and may have found a more easier way to deal with it each time, similar to how you may get the most recent and updated information from a website while doing research. Next, more experienced people may have different, more efficient ways to deal with a problem. There may be different ways to deal with the same type of situation, and you didn't realize. So when you run into the same problem again and you use the same technique to deal with it but it doesn't seem to work, just switch to Plan B that someone suggested to you. Another reason is that they may simply give you more straight-forward advice. Some people can give you a more complicated suggestion that you may not understand until after everything is dealt with, and that may be frustrating. The same person your'e asking for advice may have had that happen to them, and they try to avoid giving you that constant state of frustration, so they can just skip right to the important points.

The third and final reason is that you view more than one side. If you only ask certain people for help, they can give you advice for when you deal with the problem, you may not see the whole picture and end up dealing with consequences you didnt expect. If you ask multiple people, you can see the situation clearly and carefully deal with everything so unexpected consequences don't come out of nowhere and mess it all up. You can also make wiser decisions since you've heard every side. Finally, you can learn to avoid more habits that could have made the situation harder to deal with before.

In conclusion, it is always better to ask more than one person for help because it can make you more aware of what to do in the future, people who have more experience can help you make easier decisions, and you can view more than one side of the situation. Asking one person alone for advice may give you less ways to deal with something, while asking multiple people for their opinions means that you can combine all of their ideas to prepare for anything left to come.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5C2F188C0177,"Hearing peoples opinions is like being in a talent show and getting judge except it could provide you with great advice. Sometimes seeking multiple opinions can hurt, but they also can help you make a better choice like if your doing something you are not suppose to be doing, their opinions can keep you safe, and it can help you stay on the right track to help you suceed.

The first reason, is someone elses opinion can keep you from doing things you are not suppose to be doing like smoking, drinking, sneaking out, or even cheating on a test. One time, my older brother PROPER_NAME was asking me if he should sneak out, but before he asked me he asked my uncle Generic_Name and of cource he said no, so then he came to me and said, ""Should I sneak out tonight?"" I told him no, but he did it anyway and didn't come back until my whole family called him and told him to come back home. For him to hear all of our opinions it encouraged him to come back, so because of that he never snuck out again.

Second, others opinions can keep you out of harms way. For instance, many middle school kids can easily get persuaded in to doing things that can put them in extreme danger, but as long as you have excelent friends they can make sure you don't get hurt, Now and days kids do not care about their actions, and they don't understand that they are able to get hurt or get others hurt. That's why so many people are dying because the only opinions people care about is how they look, or how nice their clothes are meanwhile we have people that are doing stupid things and are in danger because no one really cares what others do. Everyone can always get persuaded into doing things, yet still can't get influenced to pick their life over harmful substances or choices.

Finally, your oinions can help others like your family members stay on the right path in life. For example, my mom was hanging out with the wrong group of people, so they made her try different things she never did before, and because of that she chose the wrong life style to live and it had her going in and out of jail. Since she had four kids we kind of pushed her to get her life, and decisions on the right track and it helped her. Everytime we saw her all of my siblings would give their opinions, she may have not liked what we said, but she knew it was to help her get her life together.

Therefore anything you say to someone can change their whole life around.

To sum it up, sometimes seeking multiple opinions can help you make better decisions like if you are doing something you are not suppose to be doing, their opinions can keep you safe, and it can help you stay on the right track. I feel like it is wonderful to get more than one opinion because sometimes one person's opinion can't always make you change your mind, and it is also more helpful to get more than one perspective.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
BF3CC3305C55,"My phone buzzed with his name appearing at the top. God, I don't wanna talk to you right now, take a hint man. My boyfriend and I had just had a huge fight and I'm texting my friend Generic_Name for advice. After explaining her opinion she says to listen to other peoples advice then decide what to do.

When faced with an issue normally our first reaction is to try to solve it on our own, although most of the time our head is way up in the clouds and we need another person to drag us back to the reality of the issue. Although most times, you need a few more than just that one person to help you make the correct choice. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

All in all, getting advice could be a good thing, since many different people have all had vastly different experiences. At the Virginia school of Technology they completed a study on getting advice from just one person compared to reciving advice more more than one person. Both people were given the same issue but only one was able to receive more than one persons advice. One of the conductors of the experiment, Dr. Joy Engstrom, stated that, "" The person who received more than one piece of advice seems to have made the more logical choice than the person with only one piece of advice, fixing the situation faster and healthier."" Therefore, asking more than just one person for advice can help you pull out a stronger and better outcome of the situation. Plus, receiving more advice can also hep you make a more logical choice then acting on what just one other person thinks is best. The advice given also probably would apply to other situations as well, so you are learning and growing as a person.

All the same, receiving advice from more than one person can also help to build trust with the people you ask. A study done by Jake Miller at the Maryland University of Health shows that when someone comes to another person for advice their trust in them normally increases. Mr. Miller Claims that, "" You install a certain level of trust in someone when you ask them for advice, if it be something small or something huge. Asking for their opinion on a situation also boosts the overall relationship."" More over, their advice doesn't only just help the situation it helps strengthen your relationship with those people. Plus, most of the time people are more open to helping you when you have a sturdy relationship with them. Not only does asking for advice show that you trust the people your asking but it can even help strengthen a whole groups relation and trust.

Overall, different sets of advice can also bring you to the best possibly out come. Creating a more logical and better choice to make. At the University of Utah a survey went around asking students if they made better choice when they asked more people for advice or if they made a better choice when they asked one person for advice 70.2% said they made a better choice when asking more people compared to the 29.8% that claimed they made a better choice when asking one person. However, majority claimed the best outcome would be asking just more than one person, still a lot of students replied just one person. From past experiences asking one person can make you think that that option and only that option will be the best, when in reality its actually not. When asking for advice you need someone who gives their opinion on what hey would do, not try to snatch away your judgment and brainwash you to their opinion.

In the end, asking more people for their opinion can not only help you build trust with the people you ask, but help you learn more about them and their experiences and make the best choice. So in the future it is much recommended that you seek more than just one persons opinion on a situation your not so sure about. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

When I was going through a tough time when my mom told me we were moving I was very sad,because just the thought of me leaving my friends again made me sad I didnt want to leave. I've felt this way before ,because growing up we moved a lot so i was kind of used to it but this time I made very close friends who I didnt want to leave .After talking to my dad about it he told me I could move in with him,my step mom ,and my half sister. I thought about moving in with my dad and thought how it could be a great opportunity to have some disaplince in my life. I also talked about it with my mom and she said that it would be a great opportunity to make new friends and open up a bit She also said that I would see my god mother and god brothers more often who which I care about very much. I also talked about it with some close friends and they told me that I should stay and move in with my dad ,because they know that I would miss them too much and that it would be a great opportunity to get more emotionally closer with him and that I could go vast my mom and other half sister on her days off just like i would do with my dad. I finally had the time and revise to myself and asked my self ""what do i want to do?.who should I stay with?"". I looked at it in many different ways and i compared there perspectives with others and decided to stay with my dad. I now go visit my mom on her days off .

D7B78756EA51,"Being stuck in a sticky situation can sometimes be difficult when you don't have anyone else's advice. Asking for advice from one person may help you in some ways, but if you ask multiple people for advice it could increase your chances on making a better choice. By getting advice from multiple people it could help you make a better decision because you can't always trust one person to make a decision for you, you will get a majority of one answer so it is easier to choose, and people have different opinions so you don't just rely on one.

The first reason seeking multiple opinions helps you make a better choice is trust. When your caught in a situation that isn't going so well, you might go up to one person and ask them what you should do. That person your asking might tell you something that could make that problem even worse. If you ask others for their advice then that shouldn't happen because some people want to help you make a better choice and some might not.

The next reason multiple opinions are better is because you can find out which opinion is spoken more then the other. If the majority of people say the same thing then that's great because you have most likely found your answer! When you find out what the majority said you should stick with it because that opinion isn't just spoken from one person its spoken by many. If you ask one person you are less likely to find an answer.

Lastly, advice from multiple people is better because when you ask someone a question and they say their opinion you only have that persons opinion to rely on. When you ask multiple people you will end up having a handful of opinions to choose from which is amazing because now you can find which opinion is best for you. If you stick with one persons advice it could go downhill and you would never know what other choices you could of had. It is better to hear what others have to say instead of listening to only one person.

The next time you are in a situation and need help, remember to ask multiple people because you can't trust one person to make a decision for you, you can find the majority of one answer, and people have different opinions so you don't have to rely on one. Not only will asking advice from multiple people help you make a better choice in one situation, but it will also help you in the future.    ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
586269D6471F,"Ugh! Have you ever been stuck in a tough decision? Were deciding your actions the toughest thing out of everything else? That's why seeking advice from others is helpful and it has many benefits. Asking others about your problem can offer you others' point of view on your situation, it gives you multiple choices on what you're going to do, and it also allows you to have an idea on what you're going to do. As you can see, Advice can be very rewarding and useful when you get stuck in situations.

First, you can see others' point of view on your problem. Advice can allow you to see what other people would choose to do if they were placed in your spot. For example, If you were deciding whether to hang out with friends or complete your school assignments, you could ask a friend. They would probably state what they would choose, and back it up with reasons why they chose what they chose. You would receive advice and why you should choose that option. One opinion can help you choose what you'd like to do or say. Although seeking more than just one can give you more choices and options.

Secondly, it gives you multiple options and often gives you an idea on what you're going to go with. To me, its like a video game. For instance, lets say you are battling a final boss, the game lets you choose what to do next. If you have one opinion thats your own, You'll only have that one choice and would have to go along with it because you didn't receive any other opinions from others. If you do explore others' thinking, you'll have more options to defeat that final boss.

Finally, After receiving all those ideas on what others would do if they were placed in your shoes, you can get your own idea on what to do. If you didn't like what they had to say if it was their decision, you can combine multiple opinions to produce your own to choose in your battle of choice.

Its like a math equation! If you have three plus blank is equal to six, you need that one number to complete the expression. The three represents your opinion and the blank represents someone else's opinion, When you get theirs, it's complete! You have an idea of what to do.

All in all, I think advice is a good thing. It can help out in any sort of problem you're stuck in. It is useful and again, it comes with many great outcomes. No more ugh!

When you get advice, it turns into a whoo hoo!

You aren't stuck in a tough decision anymore! And you owe it all to asking for advice from friends and family. If you're ever stuck in a tough decision, I suggest asking for advice. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
0959BDBD0FB4,"As a student I have had to ask for advice often to be able to come up with an educated response.

When I need advice I found it helpful to go to ask multiple people for their opinions rather than just one. I do this because asking more people gives you a variety of answers because people have varying opinions, a multitude of view points because not every one thinks the same way, and a plethora of different experiences to go off of.

You get multiple different viewpoints on the same topic when you ask multiple people. You get multiple different viewpoints because you should ask a variety of different people to get the most educated response. This can help you in finding your opinion because you can see both sides of the story and you make an educated decision from there. This way helps you more than just asking one person because if you only ask one person you only get part of the story rather than getting the whole thing. if you do that then you are unable to make and educated response.

People give you a variety of answers when you ask multiple people for there advice. This happens because everyone has a different variety of viewpoints, even if they are the same, they might see it a different way or have different facts backing it up. This helps you when you need advice, by letting you have the full view of the opinion and limiting the bias by using other people accounts to find the inconsistencies. When you do this it is much better than just having one opinion because that person might be biased towards one side and then by consequence your opinion will become biased.

When you ask a variety of people you get different opinions from a plethora of past experiences that led them to having that opinion. It is good to have a variety in past experiences because they can help you make an educated decisions for the present but also for the future. When you chose what experiences to go for, you should choose ones that are close to your present experiences but also for the future experiences you will go through. You should also have some experiences from the other side to siphon through the bias of the other experiences. This will help you to make an educated decision for the present but also for the future.

To sum up, I have found that when I need advice it's helpful to go to ask multiple people for their opinions rather than just one. It helps you siphon through the bias, decide which viewpoint fits you the best, and learn about the experience you might need for the present and the future. In conclusion, When ever you need advice going to multiple people is the best way to go. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
D0959D2F116B,"Have you ever been lost or confused and really needed advice? Don't worry, everyone has; at least once in their life. Many people though, only ask one person for advice, and that's where they are wrong. There are many reasons you should be asking more than one person for advice, the main one being bias. People have opinions, bias in what they tell you, so their advice might not be the best. And that's why asking more than one person might actually be the best option when seeking advice for something. Someone might also be very inexperienced in what kind of advice you are asking for, or sometimes, like me, friends like to mess with you, and you end up getting horrible advice.

Bias can be bad or good; depending on your point of view. But when looking for advice, you have the chance to choose the best advice to follow, so why not take it? Asking more than one person for advice will give you a variety of different opinions, and all you have to do, is choose the one that floats your boat, while asking one person only won't give you that much of an option. In special cases though, Everyone will give you the same advice, and if that happens, you just have to go with it. I once had this friend who was having issues with his girlfriend, he then asked one of his friends for advice, he took it, and didn't ask anyone else, they broke up the next day. A year later, he had a new girlfriend, and was having issues with this one too. He went to many people for advice and took the one that best floated his boat. They are still together today.

When asking for advice, asking people who know what they're talking about is the best option. This is common sense, but if youre asking for advice, you might not even know that the person is very inexperienced in what you're asking. Asking more than one person for advice helps you surpass this issue. How would you know the person was giving you horrible advice if you didn't ask anyone else? This is like using different online sources for an essay, it's a very bad idea to use one online source for your whole essay. I have asked for a lot of advice in the past, but I will never forget the time I asked my friend for advice on how to study for a test, he told me everything that wasn't on the test, later telling me that he didn't know what to study either.

Friends like to mess with you sometimes, often ending up in someone getting hurt or in this case, feeling dumb. Some people get enjoyment out of getting someone to fail. These people are friends, sometimes. When you ask more than one person, the chances of you using the advice of the usual prankster is lower therefore, better chances of you getting great advice. You don't wan't to be the person who is known for doing something dumb because of advice you took from a prankster, believe me. Tiktok is a good example of people trying to get you to do something incorrect. Every once in a while, there is a video which gives you advice on what to do on tests or whatever advice you're looking for. One of the videos gives you advice on what to do when stuck on a question, my friend followed that, and failed the test. he could've simply avoided this prank by asking other people for advice on the topic.

Asking more than one person for advice is really just common sense. Imagine going of of one persons advice your whole life, that would get very boring, or cause some issues. Using ""bubble"" to stay quiet as an adult would be very embarrassing. My family tree would not be a thing if my great grandmother had taken her husbands' advice of getting an abortion, instead, she asked advice of other friends and family, and decided to keep my grandma. Listening to more than one person should be something you use for the rest of your life, you will be grateful if you follow this, it really helps. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
4A3B58C0A386,"You wake up and decide today is the day to be productive and clean your room. You get up, make some breakfast and start to clean, but you quickly run out of motovation. You decide you will do it another day and go back to bed. You think to yourself that this wouldn't be a big deal if this was the first time this happened. You decide it is time to get some advice, but you don't know who to ask. Should you ask your best friend, a family member, or even that smart classmate who always gets her work done early? Well, why should you only ask just one person?

There are many reasons why asking for advice from multiple people is better than asking just one. For example, you're asking how to get motovated enough to clean your room. Someone might tell you to ""fake it until you make it"", but that might not work for you so you decide to ask someone else for advice. They tell you to view it as a goal you're trying to acheive, rather than a chore. You decide to give it a try and next thing you know your room is sparkling clean! Sometimes what works for one person does not work for others. Everyone is unique and different things work for different people, sometimes asking multiple people for advice can help you find what works for you.

Another reason you should seek advice from multiple people is so you are exposed to new options and ideas. Sometimes we only see one solution to a problem and talking to other people can help you see all of the options you have. Talking to people can open you up to new options and ideas. This can help you make a decision that will be better for you in the long run.

When you are seeking advice from other people the same solution might come up multiple times.

Sometimes people suggest what works for them, and if many people suggest the same thing you might want to try it out to see if it works to you. Sometimes this will also happen when others see a solution you might have overlooked. Sometimes we overthink things and the answer is more obvious than we thought.

Lastly, when you look for advice from more than one person, more people will know what you are going through. People will be able to listen and relate to what you are going through, and you will have people to turn to when you need help. Sometimes all we need is a little support to motovate us.

So if you are looking for advice, then you should ask more than one person. This way you can find solutions that work for you, see options you didn't know you had, see what others would do in your situation and find people that will motovate and support you.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
6FAB328F1CF5,"Have you ever been in a situation where you needed to make a decision that will affect you for the rest of your life? Who did you go to for advice? Making decisions can prove to be very difficult sometimes. Everybody has been in at least one situation where they have to make a very important decision. Many seek advice from multiple other people in order to make the best decision possible. That is the best way to get advice. If someone has gone to multiple people for advice, then the decision they were trying to make was most likely a smart one. Going to multiple people for advice can really help somebody make a logical decision that will benefit them in the future. Seeking advice from more than one person helps people make good decisions because of the information learned from their experiences, their different perspectives on certain issues or ideas, and because it has been proven to help people make smart decisions.

Firstly, seeking advice from multiple people leads to great decisions because each person that gives advice will give advice based on their own personal experiences. Assuming that they are of appropriate age, each person that gives advice will have had various work experiences and can offer advice based on those experiences. For example, when in the process of making a decision about whether or not to accept an offer to a job, those pieces of advice from those people can positively impact the decision. Additionally, the people that give advice have usually met a lot of other people and have experience with dealing with them. This is extremely important because advice can be given based on who to avoid and who to talk to. Also, the people who are giving the advice can give details about what has gone wrong at various points in their life. Multiple pieces of information about accidents happening can help keep anyone safe from those vary same situations. The first reason why getting advice from multiple other people can lead to beneficial decisions is because the advice is based on multiple experiences from those people's lives.

Furthermore, getting advice from multiple others helps lead to very smart decisions because they can offer wise advice based on their different perspectives. Everyone has been or is being raised differently and has slightly different views on certain issues and topics. When seeking advice from others, it is extremely helpful to be able to learn about the various perspectives of the people giving advice that were built during childhood. Also, other people may have influenced how the people giving advice view things. This means that the advice that is being given is not merely based on the people who are giving advice, but more people who you may not be able to talk to. The people giving advice may also have had teachers, mentors, or professors who have taught them how to view things differently. For example, someone who is seeking advice about which college they should attend might seek advice from people who have been through the process before, because they can offer views on college admission that others may not. The second reason why getting advice from multiple people leads to great decisions and success is because the person seeking advice can be offered a plethora of different perspectives.

Lastly, I have witnessed what incredible benefits seeking advice from multiple others has on someone. About one year ago, my brother, Generic_name was just beginning the college application process. He figured out which schools he was going to apply to and he applied to them. He got into five schools, but was torn between his top three schools. Generic_name went to our parents, his old teachers, school counselors, and even coaches for advice. He took notes every time he met with someone and kept it all in a notebook. After about four months, he ended up with a notebook full of advice, stories, opinions, and conversations from all those people that he talked to about college. After reading the notebook, he had pretty much already narrowed it down to one college. Generic_name could not have come to a smart, swift decision if it were not for the many people who gave him their advice. The advice he collected was so incredibly helpful because it was based on the very experiences and perspectives of the people who gave it to him. Had he only been offered advice from one person, he would have made a biased decision that may not have been right for him. Now my brother is attending a great school and is as happy as can be. This just goes to show that going to multiple people for advice is tremendously helpful and has a massive positive impact on the person or people trying to make a decision.

Seeking advice from multiple others is one of the best ways to gather extremely helpful insight that will help you make a smart, well thought out decision that will bring great benefits in the future. Firstly, it lets you learn about real experiences that have happened in other people's lives. Next, it helps you see the issue or topic from other interesting, wise perspectives. Lastly, I and many others have witnessed the amazing benefits that it has on people. If you are ever faced with a tough decision, go to multiple people for advice. I am sure that the advice they will give you will be helpful, as it will most likely be based off of experiences and different perspectives. If someone ever comes to you for advice, give them advice that will truly help them and lead them to make a great decision. They will remember and appreciate you for how much you helped them.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

When ever someone gets the same answer they know what to do, but when you get various answers you still know what to do. Getting multiple opinions could help someone get different ideas for something so they know if it's good advice or not.

When ever someone gets the same answer they know what to do, but when they get various answers they still know what to do. What that means is if you're looking for advice and you get various answers most of the answers may all be the same so you know what to do. Another reason is all of the answers in some way may link to form the same type of advice.

Getting multiple opinions could help someone get different ideas for something so they know if it's good advice or not. If someone is looking for advice and they get multiple answers on what type of advice to take, they'll ask other people if it's good advice or not so they can narrow down if they want to take that advice or ask for better advice.

Another way getting multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is if they are making a bad decision getting multiple good opinions on why that decision is bad could help them stop doing bad things and make them do good things.

The first thing that helps is, you give them many ideas on what to do. It can help open up the subject for people and they really realize whats going on. It also gives them ideas on what to do. If i asked my friend for advice, I would what him to give me multiple opinions about the question i asked him because the more information he gives me the more I will known.

2B3AA27C59CB,"Everyday, millions of people make bad decisions. It's human nature. We all do things that we don't think through, and afterwards, wish we hadn't done. But what can we do to not do these dumb things? What can we do to not be like most other humans and instead of making dumb decisions, making decisions that lead to the best possible outcome? Clearly there's more than one solution, but the one that stands out the most, is seeking help from many people. Why does seeking multiple opinions lead to better decision making?

One way seeking multiple opinions can help, is that different people have different viewpoints and see things in totally different ways. Asking multiple people that have different viewpoints can help you see the full picture. They help you see what risks you're taking with each decision, and what positives may come out of your decision. Then, they can help you weigh each decision out and make your choice. Say you're deciding what classes you're taking in college. Your counselor and parents can help you decide whether you want to take chemistry or physics first year. If you take chemistry then you get more credits, but you like physics much more. Which one would you pick? The more beneficial class, or the more enjoyable class? That's where asking for help comes in handy.

Furthermore, seeking multiple opinions buys you time to think for yourself. Although other people can help you make your decision, what you want is what's most important. Other people can help you lay out your options, and may try to talk you into a decision, but what you want is what's most important. Going back to the example from the first reason about which class you would take, I would take physics. College is the time to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life, and taking chemistry may help you make more money in the long run, but the amount of money you make is just a number if you don't enjoy what you're doing. If you know that you like physics much more than chemistry, then why waste your precious time with a class you don't even want to be in? That makes no sense. Make decisions for yourself, and your benefit when it comes to your career.

It is also the case that people are smarter in some areas than you, and can give you important insight that may lead to a change in your decision. If you are about to get brain surgery, and you know nothing about it, except that it's really dangerous and you don't want it, you'd rather live it out until you die. If you find the best brain surgeon there is, and they say they've dealt with much worse surgeries and their patients have walked out of the hospital fine after a week of recovery, wouldn't that effect your point of view? That would probably give you a new sense of hope, and make you want to go though witht the surgery right? But what if you also hear the day of the surgery that the rate of survival is low? Decision making is based off the knowledge that we have, but why don't we use our resources to find out more knowledge to imporve our decision? That's another thing to keep in mind when making important decisions. See the whole picture.

Ultimately, seeking multiple opinions can help you see the whole picture, but you have to make a decision based off what you think is right, and to make a decision off what you think is right. You should try to see the whole picture and know all the facts from either side of the decision you're making. Next time you're making an important decision, take all this into account, and make what you think is the best decision for your given situation.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
E3EC69F1DA50,"Someone seeking for multiple opinions could have a lot of different meanings behind it. Someone could be doing it for fun. Others could be doing to practice being a reporter when they grow up. Others could be doing it for a school project. Point is, there are a plethra of reasons people could be seeking opinions. Here's why.

All humans have a curious aspect to there personalities. One way people love to express that is by asking questions 24/7. And this would benefit anyone that ask questions because when you ask questions, you get an answer. And when you get an answer, that is something new that you now know. And when you learn something that you never knew before, your knowledge increases. In other words: when you learn something knew, you get smarter and you can increase your skill set. That is why it's so important to ask questions. Because not only are you learning about something new, but once you learn that new thing, you are able to so much more in life and build many qualities as a person.

Another reason people could be asking questions for opinions is that opinions can sometimes be facts. The people that ask questions for opinions are probably looking for multiple answers so he or she may be able to figure out what they need to figure out. But first, that person would need to divide these opinions apart. Then once they are divided apart into groups, that person will decide which opinions make more sense. Which ever opinions make sense the most is probably the right answer and/or fact.

Another reason someone would want multiple opinions is because they want to practice on what they want to be when they grow up. A lot of jobs involve asking a bunch of questions, so it only makes sense that this is a reason of why people ask for multiple opinions. For example, interviewer is a big one. Their whole job revolves around asking questions. Same with journalists. Only difference is that they tend to travel all around the world. Don't even get me started on therapists. Usually therapy revolves around one person. But in this case, I'm talking about couples and family therapy. Cause in this case, there are multiple people in one session.

Another reason someone could be looking for multiple opinions is because they're looking for advice. Now what they are seeking advice about is very hard to tell because there are so many things people could ask for advice about. This would be because you sometimes come across something that you're not to sure about, but that's normal cause everybody does. And the most likely thing a person would do is ask multiple people or one person for advice and let them decide for that person.

This reason is a little different from all the other reasons because this one revolves around school. The next reason of why people ask for multiple opinions is that they might have to for a school project. More than likely, the project would be in science because that's the class you get the most projects. So you would have to ask questions to get opinions and see which opinions were right.

In conclusion, there are a varieity of reasons people ask for multiple opinions. It could be about personal stuff, art stuff, school stuff, pretty much anything really. Point is, people ask for a lot of opinions. And its a good thing to. Because without opinions, we wouldn't be where we were today in the world.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EFE31525B288,"My mom receives two emails, one for hockey, and one for football. Now I have to choose hockey or football, both are expensive, so I can only play one. The next day I walk up to my friends for advice, before school starts, on what sport I should play. I like to ask what others would do so I can get their opinions on what I should pick or do. It is good to talk to more than one person for advice because you can hear from other's personal experience, hear what others would do, and they can help list the Pro's and Con's about your choices.

When I have to make a choice it helps to hear from personal experience from others. One reason is you can hear why they did that choice. I like to hear what motivated them to make that choice, and if it was a good motivation. My brother played football because he though it looked fun and he wanted to try something new. Another reason it helps to hear from personal experience, is if they liked what they choose. It is always helpful to hear the outcome of after the choice was made, and if they were grateful or regretted the choice they made. My brother was grateful for playing football because he made more friends and learned a new sport. A final reason why it is helpful to hear from personal experience is, so you can find out if they would or wouldn't recommend it for you. Before making that finale choice, it is always helpful to see if they would recommend it. If they recommend it great, that means that they think you would be happy with that choice. If they don't recommend it that is okay, but I would not make that your final choice because they think it won't be the best option for you. My brother would recommend football for me because he knows that I like to try new things and I like to run. It's always great to hear personal experience from someone if it was good or bad. It is always appreciated to hear what others would do, even if they don't have personal experience.

When asking others for advice it is great to see what they would chose ,if they had to choose between those options that you have to choose from. It's helpful to hear their reason behind the option they would choose. When I asked my friend ""Would you rather play hockey or football"", she said "" Hockey because she loves to skate and it just seems like a fun sport to play"". When I asked another friend the same question all she said was"" I would play football,"" She didn't even give a reason why.

What is the point of choosing an option if you don't have a reason to back you up. That just shows you're picking an option for the sake of picking an option. When people share their opinions they influence your final choice. When you add all the opinions people gave you it can help you make the right choice, therefor influencing your final choice. It's always great to hear what others would do, and why they would make that choice.

I also find it helpful to make a Pro's and Con's list, It's even more helpful when you make it with someone. It always helps when listing things about what is good about the choice. That list gives you a sense about why you should pick it and why it is better than the other choice. One good thing about hockey is that you get to learn how to handle a hockey stick. When making a Pro's and Con's list, you have to include the bad parts about your choice. One bad part about hockey is that you have to be good at ice skating. Once you list the bad parts about both sides it gives you an idea on why you shouldn't pick that choice. When you make this list with a friend or family member, they can help with coming up with things to add to the list. Even though this list isn't giving you a straight opinion, it is still helpful. Once you look at both the Pro's and Con's together it can help you get an idea on what you are going to choose. Making a Pro's and Con's list can be really helpful, it can be even more helpful when you do it with someone.

It is good to ask more than one person for advice because you get to hear their opinion on what they would do, they can help list the good and the bad on each choice, and you can hear what they choose when they had to choose between those options. Asking for advice is really helpful than just picking a random choice with out any advice. When you ask for advice from someone you can never go wrong.         ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

D2B408505884,"How does asking others for advice help someone make a better choice?

A while ago, a podcast had been going around asking random people one specific question. The question was if asking others for advice on a problem helps them make better choices. Majority of them said that it does help and most of their reasons were similar. I agree that asking for advice from others helps you make better choices. This can benefit you in the way you make hard choices in many ways. Asking others for advice helps someone make a better choice because you can see the persons perspective on the situation, it gives you more options, and you will not have to face the problem on your own.

When you ask for advice from others, you will be able to see and understand the persons perspective on the situation. Seeing and understanding that persons perspective really does help because you might see the problem differently. It will also probably make you rethink your choice. Almost everyone has a different opinion on a problem. The times we face our own problems, we have our own opinion on it. We may see it as a big problem and others may see it as a small one. Eventually, there will be times when we do not need others people advice.

However, when they explain the way they see the problem, you might see it too. You may not like it, but at least you were able to see things differently and try something new.

There might even be a possibility that you might change the others persons way of making choices. Peoples perspective and opinion can change over time

Asking for peoples opinion can give you more options. It is hard to make a choice when you do not have a fresh idea. This will give you the opportunity to think carefully and choose the best choice. Personally, I think that it is easier when you have more options to choose from. Our choices can sometimes make the problem worse. That is why you need to have an open mind. Having an open mind can lead to a better outcome.

Lastly, this benefits you because you will not have to face the problem by yourself. Most of us think that we need to resolve our problem on our own. It is always better to have people by your side when you need to make a choice. Even if it is just one person, that one person can help a lot more than you think. Also, nothing positive will really come out when you do stuff on your own. There is a certain point where you can not do it alone anymore. We are growing more everyday. Growing up comes with a lot of responsibility and with a lot of new responsibility comes hard choices. You will make mistakes and just will want to give up, but making mistakes leads you closer to success. It will not be easy, but all you need to do is trust in the right people, Later on, you will see that the outcome isbetter than you expected.

In conclusion, asking others for advice helps you make a better choice because you can see the persons perspective on the situation, it gives you more options, and you will not have to face the problem on your own. These are the reasons why I personally believe that asking for advice will help you make better choices. There will be times when you have to make difficult choices and you will not know what to do. You may think that you need to do it own. We will face challenges, but there are people who will be there for you. Asking for help does not make you weak. They will help you in making your choices; they will lead you toward your success. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

45AE96545D1A,"Seeking multiple opinions on an issue helps people make the better choice in a situation in many ways. Hearing multiple people's stances in a situation helps make the solution clearer. Therefore helping someone make a better choice.

For example, advice is more credible when given from multiple sources. If many people give you the same advice the odds of it being correct are greatly increased. For instance, when someone has an issue and many trusted people believe in a solution, their opinions are almost certiainly the best option. In addition, it can help you find the better solution to have multiple people confirm that it is the best option in the situation.

Furthermore, multiple viewpoints can help you better solve the issue at hand. Having input from both sides of a spectrum can help you find out what is better to do in a situation. In other words, a multitude of opinions can help you find a middleman of sorts to resolve the issue. Additionally, in some cases having multiple viewpoints can cause a realization that will please both sides.

Finally, multiple pieces of advice gives you the chance to have other advice in the case that one is wrong. Before making a decision, if you are given bad advice you have the opportunity to hear other opinions and correct the mistake. It can also help if you are given a bad opinion and have other input to help you realize which is the best option. Plus, when given multiple opinions you will allways have other advice to fall back on just in case.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions on an issue can help you find the best choice in someones situation. It can confirm the best option or even help rule out the bad ones. Any way you put it, asking multiple people's opinions is way more likely to help someone make a better choice than just one person's opinion.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F9D6B1172C58,"Thoughts and emotions racing through my mind the sweating and panting was getting worse. It was just a choice that needed to be made. I think that it's important to ask multiple people for advice when someone is making a choice. It helps people learn more and gain a better experience.

Asking multiple people for advice helps people learn more. Firstly, it helps others acquire more knowledge. When someone asks multiple people for advice, not only do they get opinions, but they also get an insight on that particular person's past. As a result, it causes people to learn new life-lessons or morals. Secondly, it also helps that person be more aware of how to deal with that choice in the future. When someone gets advice or opinions from multiple people they can learn how to use those opinions when those choices appear later in their life. That advice will help them without having to worry or contemplate their decision. Lastly, it teaches that person how to be aware of their resources. It teaches them that their not alone and increases their confidence in their decision. For example, when I was in third grade I didn't know if I should tell someone that my friend was being bullied. So, I talked to my parents and my sister. In the end, they helped me be more confident with my choice of telling my teacher what was happening and I knew who I could go to if it occurred again. It's important to ask more than one person for advice because it teaches people in a different perspective.

Secondly, asking multiple people for advice helps to gain a more interesting experience. It gives someone multiple ways to deal with a decision. Once someone gets multiple ways to solve a problem they're less stressed on how to solve it. As a result, it also ends up going much more smoother than expected. These situations are almost like a GPS, which gives you multiple directions. Sometimes the GPS gives you different routes or exits. However, people end up choosing the best route for their situation. Getting advice doesn't just teach someone about how to deal with the problem, it also teaches them about the person giving them the advice. When someone learns from other people, they also learn more about the person. They can get an understanding of that person's personality or how they grew into the person that they are today! After, it can help gain a special bond with that person. For instance, this can involve gaining a special form of trust with someone and helping them find someone to rely on. There are many trusted adults which can help give advice. Some examples may be a teacher, counselor, older sibling, or relative. Getting advice from multiple people helps others gain a more intriguing experience.

In conclusion, I believe that it's important to ask multiple people for advice when someone is making a choice. It helps people gain more information and it helps others have a more compelling experience. Wouldn't you want to open up your life to more wider possibilities for your future?",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
62E08644BD3B,"When seeking advice, people often ask more than one person; they do this to receive multiple opinions on the advice. People ask multiple opinions for many reasons, but here are a few. Some of the benefits, of seeking different opinions, are that you will get more accurate advice, you will get more perspectives on advice, and you will receive advice that you can trust.

First, when you get multiple opinions, you will get more accurate advice. Asking one person their opinion could give you wrong information, but by asking multiple people you are more likely to get more accurate advice. Some people have more knowledge or experience on the topic than others: it would be better to ask them for advice. For example, it would be more beneficial to ask a basketball player for advice about basketball, rather than someone who has never played the sport. Doing this will give you the most accurate advice.

Next, by asking more than one person for advice, you will get more perspectives on the advice. If you ask someone for advice from one person they may only look at it from one perspective , but asking many people you will get many different perspectives. An example would be if you asked one person their advice and then asked another person their advice. They may both give accurate views, but each have completely different views on the advice. So by asking both of them their perspectives, you can use both opinions to make the decision that will be most beneficial.

Lastly, you will get trustworthy opinions. If you ask a peer or someone that is untrustworthy, they might give you incorrect advice purposefully to be unkind. That happens quite often in schools. A peer may tell you advice to get you into trouble or cause you to look unintelligent. It is better to receive advice from many people to make sure that the information you are advice is true. That way if the advice is untrue you can not use the advice.

When looking for advice, you should ask multiple peoples opinions. Asking multiple people for advice will give the most accurate advice, give many perspectives on the advice, and give you the most trustworthy advice. Also you should seek advice from people with experience, people with different perspectives, and people that you trust. Doing this will cause the decision that you make to be the most accurate, the most beneficial, and make the better choice.         ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
57A4BDE06D1B,"When you ask for advice, do you go to one person and get only one opinion, or do you go to multiple people, and get multiple opinions? I believe that when it comes to getting advice you need to, keep an open mind, get multiple opinions, and think about everything logically when getting your advice.

When it comes to people needing advice I think that the first thing that people need to do is have an open mind. If you need help with something and you don't have an open mind about things you're never going to get anywhere. For example, lets say that you are in a fight with your friend, and you go to one of your other friends for advice on what to do. Are you going to go to your other friend needing advice an not having an open mind on what they may or may not have to say to you? No of course not because you can't really solve anything that way.

In addition, to keeping and open mind you also need to get multiple opinions, because you can't solve a problem just by getting only one persons opinion on the matter. That would be like going up to a group of your friends and saying, ""I want to go get ice cream. How about you Generic_Name?"" Then deciding on whether you go get ice cream or not just depending on her answer and her answer only, when there is a whole group of people who also have opinions on the situation as well.

Finally, after you have had an open mind and gotten multiple opinions, then you can start to make your decision, but you still have to think about it logically. Lets say just for example that you are thinking about going to get lunch with some friends. You've invited everyone, and they all said that they were coming you meet up somewhere, but now you have to decide where you all want to go. You picked out two different restaurants that you knew all of your friends would like and you got advice from a couple of your friends on where they thought the best place to go was. Now you have a decision to make. So what do you do? Pick where you want go the most, or pick where everyone else said that they would be happy? you need to think about it logically and make the best decision for the group and for you.

In conclusion, I hope that you can see that when it comes to getting advice, the best things that you can do are to keep and open mind, get multiple opinions, and then in the end, think about everything logically to make the best choice or decision on whatever it may be that you are struggling with. Just remember although things may get hard at times if you do the three steps of keeping an open mind, getting multiple opinions, and thinking about things logically then you will be able to get through anything.        ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Is their a lot of homework? Are phones allowed?"" asks Generic_Name. ""Generic_Name! Calm down, high school is not that bad as everyone says it is. Yes, it is bigger than middle school and you have more things to do but it is better, I promise. Now, take a chill pill and stop worrying so much. You still have a couple more months of middle school left,so just focus and enjoy them."" ""Thank you for the advice Generic_Name, I really appreciate it."" Generic_Name responds. ""Anytime you need something just let me know"" says Generic_Name.

Seeking multiple opinions can give you a better choice because you have more options, everyone does different things, and you are able to talk to new people.

Seeking multiple opinions can give you a better choice because you have more options. I know you are probably confused by that but what I mean is not everyone is the same. People have different perspectives on different things. If you want to try out for a sport, awesome! But wait..what do you have to do? You go and ask someone named Generic_Name, who is a cheerleader, what the things are required to try out. She says you need a form signed by a parent, your concussion training,and the sport you want to do. Hang on... what sport do you want to do again? You ask someone named Generic_Name, who is a sophomore that has been on the volleyball team since freshman year, what sports your local high school has. She responds with ""basketball,football. baseball,wrestling,soccer, cheer leading,track,volleyball,golfing,and swimming"". You've never tried basketball before so you're interested in it. You try out and you end up not liking it, at least you have other choices to decide from, right?

Seeking multiple opinions can give you a better choice because everyone does different things. Generic_Name does cheer leading, Generic_Name does volleyball, and Generic_Name does track. As you can see, no one does the same sport. They all do different sports because they believe whatever sport they do fits them. Just because your friend,Generic_Name, tries out for soccer doesn't mean you have to. Find a sport that you like and a sport that suits you and stick with it. Do a sport that you've never done before and see where it takes you. If you only do it for a season, that's fine. Try out again in the next season if you want to. Unless you want to try out for a different sport. You could be a cheerleader like Generic_Name, or a volleyball player like Generic_Name. Do you want to run the 100 meter like Generic_Name? Everyone does different sports because they like to do it and they have other options just like you.

Seeking multiple opinions can give you a better choice because you are able to talk to new people. Let's say that you are new to a school and you want to be able to make friends. You try out for the volleyball team and you end up liking it and you make it! You meet so many new people that become your friends and they give you tips and tricks to fix your mistakes. Not only do they help you, but you also help them. If they give you advice, you can give them advice and help them out as well. Volleyball is great and you are so happy you tried out for the team because you didn't just form a bond with new people, you also found a sport that you love and it suits you.

C3A369E86900,"My opinion when people ask for advice is they might want help, a good understanding, to see what others are thinking, or to see a situation in somebody's point of view. Most of the time, when you talk to multiple people you most likely really want an answer to something. Thats why most people go ask others so they can find what cab be the best answer and what makes the most sense.

Why seeking for opinions could be better? It could be better because the answer that the person is giving could be the answer they're looking for. Seeking for opinions is actually a good idea sometimes, you get to know what other people are thinking or others point of view of the situation, say if your close friend is in a different mind set as you and he/she is confused with what is going on or dont understand yall can help each other to understand and get to know whats going on in the situation and how to get a good answer and result.                              ",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
FFA6D576449B,"The reason why I think people would like multiple opinions is that It would help them make a better choice ,also knowing that they have gotten other peoples opinion will make them feel better.

The reason having multiple choices is so you can feel reassured of what you have chosen is right for example. Say that you are trying to buy a car and you ask for other peoples opinion so you know what's right so when you have made the purchase or not you will feel better of what you have done.

Also the opinions might open your eyes to something better than what you have chosen ,like on the car if a lot of people said no then you might realize that you dont need the car it was just a toy so you get something better. Like a dog or a house just something to make you feel better. And having others opinions are good for you.

Another reason to have multiple opinions is so you can make the right choice. Just like the government they do not just have one person make all the choices, they make sure that they have multiple opinions so they can make sure what's best for their country and for themselves to. So if was just one person making all the decisions it would a disaster because they could be in a bad stage one day and cause a war outbreak and if there were more people they would have more opinions to make the better decision for everyone. So multiple opinions are good it might not be the out come you want but at least it's a better choice that one person has. Opinions are also another way for people to do your thinking so it's easier on you.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
A535F9081747,"One persons advice can have misleading actions but multiple advice can have a positive or negative action as well. It's better to ask for multiple advice than one persons advice. Some advice might be bad and others might be good; however, those bad advice can lead to some very poor choices. In my opinion, helpful choices leads to positive actions. One advice will not always be helpful but other advice can be. There are multiple people out there that can give you advice like parents, teachers, friends, or siblings. When asking for advice helps people out and not next time that kid or adult can help another person out. Seeking for advice is never a bad answer but its never right either. Healthy advice mean healthy relationships, healthy attitude, and healthy acts of kindness.

It's alright to make the wrong choices sometimes but next time learn for that mistake. Some children makes the wrong decisions then ask for advice and adults do it too. Everybody is not perfect, we all are going to make big mistake or the wrong choices; therefore, we learn by our mistakes. If we keep making the wrong choices we will never learn from that mistake. It all depends on the advice that someone gave a other person and with that advice something good may come out of it or something bad may come out if it. Nevertheless, it always up to that person who makes that decision. Sometimes a person might have made the wrong choice for bad advice but learn for it and made healthy actions.

Furthermore, asking for advice can make that person happy and feel good about them self. They can even ask the same person for advice too but it's always better to keep switching to other people. When I ask for advice, I try to make sure that something good will come out of it. Sometimes I even ask for advice from different people, I kick out the bad advice and try to work with the best advice. That might not work for other people because we are not the same person. Some teenagers might think its cool to ask for advice and share it with their friends. When asking for advice listen very carefully because they never if it might be outstanding, or not as good.

Finally, it's always best to ask for advice from multiple people and not only one person. A person can be really wrong and they make a person very confident with bad advice. I think it's better to ask adult for advice than to ask a kid because they have more experiment than we do. It's always up to anybody to make bad decisions or to make good decisions. To finish this off, It's never wrong to ask for another persons advice just make sure it's a good advice with a poistive outcome.      ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C21666E1F270,"Some people say that the more outcomes you get, the better the choices you will make. My grandpa has always told me to ask others for their opinion, even if you do not like it. I have had many hard decisions come up in my day-to-day life, but I have always asked others for there advice. There are three reasons to ask other people for their advice: more outcomes, better outcomes, and if you put all the outcomes together, you can decide on one.

One reason people should ask others for there advice is that you will have more outcomes than what you were thinking. You can ask your family, friends, and even classmates. An example of someone helping me is when I did not know how shoot a basketball. I first asked my dad and he gave some advice to me, and showed me how to take that advice , and then I went to my grandpa, and he gave me advice too. I have now been playing basketball since I was four years old. This is an example of always asking others for help, even if your scared they might make fun of you.

Another reason is that you get better outcomes. You can get advice from multiple people, but you will always know when you get the best advice. My dad has gave me multiple advice about one thing, but I never knew what was the best advice, until I heard it. I was sitting on the couch one day and I asked my dad how good do I have to be, to be in the NBA. He told me to practice each day, and to work hard at practice. I didn't know which one was the most important until he later said, and pay close attention to when the coach is talking. I knew that was the most important. Although the other reasons were also important, I knew if I didn't pay attention to the coach, then I could not pay attention in the game, and that is why the guys in the NBA are so focused on the game and nothing else.

A third reason is if you put all the outcomes together, then you can decide on which is the best advice. Some people throughout my life, friends, family, and classmates, have took in so much advice they don't know what to choose. But if you add all that advice together, then you will find your most reliable advice. My baseball, basketball, and football coaches have given me tons of advice. After they tell me a whole lot of advice, I put all that advice together and get my main point. I have been playing sports for a very long time, and although I have gotten better from playing, I have also gotten better from listening to all the advice, coaches, parents, and friends have given me.

In conclusion, it is very important to take advice from multiple people. It will help you get better at what your doing, and will help you later on in your future. The next time someone tries to offer advice, you might wanna think, the more outcomes I get will be better, and the better outcomes I will have will be better, and I can put all this advice together and see what I get. Do not be scared of asking people for there advice or you might miss out on something really cool.

You basically get advice from someone everyday. There is so many different types of ways that you can give somebody advice. You can give them bad advice, and good advice. Sometimes people go to multiple different people for their advice. You have to be careful and make sure that you only take the good advice people will try to give you bad advice just because they are mean. So make sure that you always take the good advice. You could go up to someone and get advice and think that it is really good and then get more advice from another person and then realize that the advice that, that person gave you is really bad and you should not use it. If you use the bad advice it could lead to many different problems.

Going to many different people for advice is a good thing to do although it may be a confusing thing to do to pick the right thing to do. Because one person could give you good advice and the next could give you really bad advice now there is a major difference between those two. You never want to take bad advice because that could lead into something really bad.

It is a good idea to get advice from many different people because someone could give you better advice then others. You will have to think which advice is better. You should always take advice from people that you genially trust. Otherwise you may get really bad advice and think that it is good and use it. If you get it from multiple people you may realize that that advice that someone gave you is really bad and that is you use it then you could be in trouble.

For good advice, you can help someone if they are confused or if they are in trouble, you arent always in trouble though a lot of the times that is what advice is used for. You may have someone you like and need advice on someone who has had experience with having a boyfriend or a girlfriend. Or it maybe that you have a test coming up and you are worried and you need advice to not worry. You may not realize how good people are to give you that advice. Without advice everyone would not know what to do. You would need help from someone but you would not have anyone to give you advice. You may not think that you need advice but you are always in need of it.

You have to be careful there is people in the world that will give you bad advice and you may not even know. They could tell you what not to do instead of what to do. There is many ways that this can happen, when people tell you bad advice you may think that it is good advice and you should use it. when someone gives you advice you have to really think and say to yourself, ""is this good advice or bad advice."" Because you may not think it then but most of the time people try to give you bad advice. For example if you were taking a test and you didn't study and you don't know the answers and someone tells you just to copy of somebody, that is bad advice. You never know if that person actually knows what they are doing, You could get caught by the teacher and then you could get some form of detention, it could be lunch, after school, or it could even be ISS. That is why it is bad advice you may not think it could lead up the that point but most of the time it does.

I think that you should get my point now, how advice could be good or bad.

You should get advice from multiple different people to see what they think about it, what you should do. You get advice everyday even if you don't even know it. But always make sure that it is good advice. I would only take advice from someone that you really trust. I would not go up to people that you just met and ask for advice because they can easily give you bad advice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F058680DCA46,"Have you ever gotten advice from other people? If you haven't then you probably should and here is why, some people have been around longer than you, so you won't get just one opinion, and some people just want the best for you.

The first reason why is that some people have been around longer that you. Given that they have been around for longer they will know what they are talking about and have seen more things than you have. An example of this is when I wanted help so I asked my grandparents for help because they knew more than me and what do you know they knew the answer.

The second reason is so that you don't get only one opinion. If you were to get an opinion for only one person than you have no way of knowing whether that opinion was biased or not. For me I think the more opinions that you get the easier it is to sort out the biases. Also the more opinions that you get the more you can see who liked what. say you were going to an amusement park and you wanted to see what rides that were fun to ride on, so you asked all of your friends what rides were fun to do. You would not of been able to do that if you had gotten just one opinion.

The third and last reason is some people only want the best from you. When your parents give you advice it is not to be annoying but to help you with life, so you should probably go with what they are saying. When grandparents give you advice you would definitely want to take that into consideration because, going back to the first reason, they have been around for longer than you have.

That is why you should get advice from others. Some people have been on this earth longer, so you won't only get one opinion, and because some people want the best for you the next time that someone gives you advice you should take it into consideration and remember these reasons.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
90CE234C9684,"I believe that it is best to ask a multitude of people for their opinion before making a decision. Having multiple opinions instead of just one leads to a better understanding of the situation, along with a variety of choices and reassurance in the decision. There have been many times in life that I have had to make an important decision. For instance, during my first year of middle school, I had to decide on what to do for a longtime friend who had chosen to prioritize her other friends over me. At the time, I chose to ask three people for advice; a mutual friend, an outside friend, and my mom. During the process, I learned that there were several advantages to seeking advice from multiple people instead of limiting myself to one.

Firstly, I was able to understand the situation more fully from the feedback that I got from different people. Initially, I had felt resentment towards my friend for choosing her other friends over me. However, from listening to different opinions, I was able to put together a better, more unbiased view of the situation. The mutual friend that I had talked to mostly shared the same opinion as me, while the outside friend was more sympathetic towards my friend. On the other hand, my mom had a completely different opinion from any of us. She thought that my friend wasn't choosing her other friends over me, per say, but just learning to get along with others in our age group as well. By putting the various opinions together, I was able to acknowledge that the fault did not fully lie with my friend and that there could be a misunderstanding.

Secondly, I had a wider range of choices due to having asked many different people. Individually, I was only offered a single solution that they believed would be the best choice of action. As a total, however, I had three different choices because each person had offered a choice each. The mutual friend felt that I should remain passive and make a final decision to either keep or break our friendship based on how the situation resolved itself. On the contrary, the outside friend believed that I should directly confront my friend and work out the misunderstanding. Finally, my mom thought that I could remain friends with her, but just not as closely as before. As a result, I chose to remain distant friends with her instead of making any drastic decisions. From having a variety of choices, I felt that I had a lot of freedom in making my decision.

Lastly, from asking for advice from multiple people, I felt more reassured that I had truly weighed all my options before settling on one. I placed trust in those I had asked for advice and myself when making my final decision. Although I may have remained uncertain if I had only asked one person, I was confident in my choice. I had taken the time and effort to speak with three vastly different people with differing viewpoints and I knew that I had done all that I could in order to ensure that I wouldn't be making a mistake. It was easy for me to finalize my decision because of the certainty that I felt regarding my choice.

In conclusion, I believe that seeking multiple opinions is beneficial to making a decision because it leads to a mostly unbiased view of the problem, a wide range of choices, and confidence in the decision. Although there may be exceptions to this, it was true in my experiences. There is no shame in asking for help in making a decision. After all, even the wisest can have trouble with making personal choices. When encountered with a troubling decision, it is best to ask for multiple opinions from various people. I learned many lessons from the experience of making a choice about my friend, but the most important one was that asking for advice from a variety of people can lead to a better decision than one you may make from one person's advice. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
7614540E8571,"""Hey Generic_Name what do you think about this new video game?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Dont ask just me because then you might be getting a bad opinion from me!"" Generic_Name replied. ""Okay, I'll make sure to ask someone else as well to get their opinion, thanks Generic_Name!"" Generic_Name said. Asking for two opinions is good because you see the bigger picture, eliminate bias, and you can make a better choice.

Firstly, asking for two opinions is good because you can see the bigger picture. ""Hey Generic_Name should i get Space Defenders 4 or Battle for the Netherlands 2?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Is that even a question?"" Generic_Name replied, ""Get Space Defenders 4 man, the company for Battle for the Netherlands 2 is corrupted, they keep making the game more and more expensive!"" ""Whoa whoa whoa stop right there!"" Generic_Name interrupted, ""The makers of Battle for the Netherlands are making the game more expensive because they're getting lots of sales and want to make more profit! It's simple economics Generic_Name!"" ""Thanks Generic_Name! I'll take that into consideration when I'm deciding!"" Generic_Name replied. Seeing the bigger picture allows you to see where a company or person might be getting their reasoning from when they make what seems to be a bad decision. When taking that extra info into consideration it allows you to understand the consequences of taking the other choice that might be more risky. With school laptops and computers, it might seem ridiculous the schools are getting such slow computers, but in fact they get them early so that they can last a long time and save a lot of money on technology for the years to come.

Secondly, asking for two opinions is good because it helps you eliminate bias. ""Hey Generic_Name do you think Fortnite or Minecraft is better?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Fortnite is way better than Minecraft dude,"" Generic_Name replied. ""Well I'm still going to ask Generic_Name what he thinks because you might have a biased opinion and you don't know it!"" Generic_Name answered. Biased opinions can seriously affect a companies sales, or a consumers choice, or even what materials are used to make the product in the first place! When using something that is biased, you get something that could be a much worse choice. Using non-biased opinions from friends and family is much more reliable than using a biased opinion since you are more likely to get a better product or service if you go based on facts, and not opinions.

Thirdly, asking for two opinions is good because you can make a better choice. ""Generic_Name what do you think about Sauce Mixer 3? It has 200 reviews and they're all positive,"" Generic_Name asked. ""I think you should get it if its got mostly positive reviews"" Generic_Name replied, ""What do you think Generic_Name?"" ""Well I think you should get Cheese Factory Simulator, its got the same amount of reviews with 94% of them being positive, and it's $8 cheaper than Sauce Mixer 3!"" Generic_Name replied. Making a better choice can not only help you now, but it can also benefit you later when the price of the game might go up! Making a better choice can mean you have more of a certain resource to spare so you can donate extras to charity or some other organization. Not having that extra bit of money could mean you wouldn't have enough money to have nice food, or any food at all, until you have more money.

""Hey Generic_Name?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Yeah Generic_Name?"" Generic_Name replied. ""Did you ever get that game?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Actually no I didn't, I was too afraid I was gonna make a bad choice!"" Generic_Name said. ""Well you're in luck! I just got an e-mail that the game is on sale for 20% off!"" Generic_Name answered. ""Oh cool! So now I can get this game and still feel good because I'll be saving money as well!"" Generic_Name said.

6585105C64D7,"People who ask for advice are more likely to have better communication skills than others who don't. This is because human-to-human interactions causes more awareness to the people around you, rather than searching up for advice on the internet. Seeking more opinions helps you discover more about the, ""What's, why's, and how's"" to more situations. Asking only one person would help you, somewhat, but would not open you up to more ideas in the near future. Talking to more than one person to seek advice would allow you, and other people to build a foundation for multiple problems.

When seeking for more than one opinion for advice, you have the ability to hear more than one side of the story. In alternative you'd be able to see who is in the right and who is in the wrong of the situation, sort of like a judge. Finding a way to resolve what you needed advice for will help you better understand what you need to fix, but sometimes the better choice isn't always something you want to go with. This is why you need more than one option to find out a better way to resolve the problem then what you've started with.

Asking only one person for advice would limit your options by a ton. Resulting in a lacking complexion to the problem. You would not have much evidence about the situation. Nor being specific about the task at hand if you only have one person to talk to. You would not know if that person is speaking with truth or not because you don't have consent to anyone else. You may not know if that person is willing to give you good or bad advice, but you can easily identify that with their body language. An example would be someone nervously sweating, hyperventilating, pacing back and forth, inconsistent eye contact, and stuttering if caught in a lie.

Having more than one opinion when asking for advice would increase your ability in learning other people's personalities easier. Communication is key to having a good friendship with others, which will help you gain trust to others, resulting in good advice. One example is work; when you're at a meeting you'd be able to share you ideas with others while gaining advice from more than one person. The ability to find what's the right advice for you will have a huge impact on your reputation and trust in others.

Seeking out advice from more than one person would not only result in better communication skills, but would have a life impact. Finding more opinions will help you find more data that will help you find a solution to your problem easier. Asking more than one person for advice would not only help you, but others, it would advance your communication skills by a ton.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
0EC6CB60A702,"When making an important decision, should you make the choice on your own or ask other people for their opinions as well? Seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial for you in many different ways. It can expose you to a wider range of ideas, allow you to see new perspectives on ideas that you already have, and give you advice from people who have already experienced the same thing that you are going through.

Seeking multiple opinions can expose you to a wider range of ideas. Each person you ask could have their own unique idea that you might not have thought of before. Even if you don't like someone's suggestion, it could help spark different ideas in you. For example, when my older sister Generic_Name was deciding what high school she wanted to attend, she spoke to many different people about it. Her English teacher recommended a private school nearby that Generic_Name had never heard of before. However, that school turned out to be perfect for her, and she ended up choosing to go there in the following fall. This is just one example of how seeking multiple opinions can expose you to a wider range of ideas.

Seeking multiple opinions can also allow you to see new perspectives on ideas that you already have. You may get overwhelmed by many different ideas and struggle to make the best choice. If you speak to another person, they could help you sort through all of your ideas and give you their opinion. They might also point out something that you hadn't previously noticed, which could help you in making a final decision.

When seeking multiple opinions, you could get valuable advice from people who have already experienced the same thing that you are going through. For example, if you are trying to decide whether you want to stay in your parents' house or move out into an apartment, you could talk to someone older than you who has already faced that decision. They could tell you what their decision was, as well as how they came to that conclusion. They could also explain how that decision affected them later on and what they think is the best choice for you. This advice could be extremely helpful.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help you make the best decision for many different reasons. It can expose you to a wider range of ideas, allow you to see new perspectives on ideas that you already have, and give you advice from people who have experienced the same thing that you are going through.

0EE9980F4C4B,"There are many times where you might need to make an important choice, but you don't know what to do; so, you seek advice from individuals you know. Asking for people's opinions when you're unable to make a decision happens often to many people; whether, it's the smallest of things or the biggest. It can be like asking your friend what to wear to the party on Friday or consulting with your teachers and family on which college to attend to. However, it's always preferred that you ask advice from numerous people. Seeking advice from multiple individuals is crucial so you can hear multiple opinions and views about your problem, and it will assist you to making the best choice possible by having reliable opinions and choices.

Asking for different people's advice can help you seek varying solutions and options to help you make a decision. To know all the pros and cons about the choice your making, you'll need to hear a variety of views and opinions from different people, so you can also avoid all bias. When I was picking out my high school electives I didn't know whether to quit French and start learning Arabic or to continue French. At the time, I had to conference with my counselor, discuss it with my parents, and even ask my friends for their opinions. Seeking all those differing opinions helped me consider all possible choices and outcomes. In the end, after I had asked everyone for advice I agreed with most of them that I should't quit learning French, as most said that I should do the class that I liked best and that was French class. In conclusion it's smarter to seek multiple opinions in order to know all the possible choices you can make and the consequences of them.

Another reason why you should seek different opinions is so you can pick the best advice by having multiple sources and people's views to rely on. Sometimes listening to only one person might not be as beneficial for many reasons; they might of had never experienced with the situation you're dealing with, they may be uninformed, and of course they can be biased. For example, asking your fellow friend for advice for a class project even though they're not the most attentive in class nor are they amazing with projects might not be the safest of ideas. However, if you were to ask your teacher and a other fellow classmates you can hear their advice for how to improve your project for class and have reliable opinions. In the end, you should ask numerous people for their advice, so you can pick the most logical choice.

Overall It's beneficial to ask for multiple individuals for their advice for a problem instead of just one person, since you can take in all possible choices and options and know their consequences, and so you can obtain numerous reliable opinions to make the perfect choice for your problem. Asking different people for advice can help you hear about a variety of information; and you can even come across new ideas that you never thought about. You can also ensure that you can hear from different sources and hear the most accurate of advice to make the best choice possible. To sum it up the next time when asking for advice for a personal issue or a choice you have to make, try asking different people and see what they have to say about it.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
7B6F4F1F08FE,"Why do people sometimes ask more than one person for advice.

People sometimes seek multiple opinions because, other people can have different view points, they can have a different background, and they can have more experience.

To begin with, when people get advice from different view points, they can see all of the pros, as well as the cons. If you only consult with one person they could become bias for something, but the same could being against something because they to could also become bias. Having view points that differ from other people, could lead to disagreement, but that could also good because then the person asking for advice can see the different side of the ""story"".

Furthermore, people with different backgrounds can give different advice about places or things that come form were they have originated from. Having different backgrounds can give the person asking for advice different perspectives about the topic.

Last of all, if you get advice from people with different experiences, they can tell you different things from the places they have been. With experience comes wisdom, and most people don't have the opportunity to get that experience or wisdom, so they need to get it from people who can have the opportunity to get it. When people have the opportunity to get experience, then they can do that particular thing almost without effort.

To conclude, these are the reasons why people seek multiple options is, others can have more experience, they could come from different backgrounds, and they could have different view points and that is why, I think people consult more than one person for advice. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B864F3DC71FC,"Advice is a good thing to ask for when you are unsure about a decision you want to make. Many people believe that you should only ask one person for advice when you have a problem, but I disagree strongly. Asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice, for it can keep you from making mistakes, make your decision easier to make, and help you see others point of view.

To begin with, making a mistake is not a hard thing to do in this world, just one wrong word and there is a big problem. Sometimes, you might think that you are doing something right, but end up hurting another persons feelings. This is a reason why asking for advice from others is a good thing to do. For example, you get into an argument with your friend because you accidentally said something that hurt their feelings, so you ask for advice from your other friends to refrain from making the same mistake as before.

Also, when you ask for advice it not only helps stop you from making mistakes, it makes your decision easier to make. Some decisions are really hard to make especially when it comes to the people you care about. Which is another reason that asking others for advice is very important. When you have others to help debate on which choice is the best for you, it makes the decision way easier for you to make. For instance, after you ask for advice you and the people giving you advice could talk about it, to help you realize the best choice to make.

Lastly, other peoples point of view is very important when it come to confrontation. When you are arguing with someone, you might think you are right in the moment but realize how wrong you were later. When you ask for others advice they might give you the point of view of the person you were arguing with. In a typical case, you tell your friends your side of the story and they help inform you on the other persons point of view to help you understand that not everything that you said or did was not the right thing to do in that situation.

In conclusion, no one knows what to say or do in every situation , and that is why asking for others advice is important. They are not going to all say the same thing but that is the best part about it. With all the different opinions being thrown at you it can help, keep you from making mistakes, make your decision easier, and help you see others point of view.  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

But when you get advice from multiple people, you mostly get the advice you need and want. Getting advice from multiple people is better than talking to one person.

Getting advice from other people is better than just having one person talk to you. When you're in a bad situation, obviously you need advice. Just talking to one person would not be helpful.

CED03E44340E,"Are you ever in that one situation where you have to make a difficult decision and you don't know which option is the right one? Seeking advice from others is one of the best ways a person can make a mindful decision. Advice from others can do this by giving different approaches to a problem, relieving stress, and prepare a person for other future choices as well as motivating others. In addition, it's entirely free!

Most people who are involved in making important decisions usually do not call on others for help and are statistically proven to make choices that they later regret. This is mainly due to the fact that people who only listen to their own advice often lack perspective. Perspective from others can help give the decision maker more options and give a clearer view of which decisions are not the best to make. To no surprise, advice from others is the best way a person can use those viewpoints to their advantage. Not only do more options open up to the decision maker but they will also have enough evidence or support to lead to their final decision. Eighty-Nine percent of people who took the advice from peers or friends and looked at a situation in a different viewpoint than their own arrived at a better decision than those who listened to only themselves. Thus, advice from others can lead to more beneficial viewpoints than the advice from one's self.

Majority of the time, the decision maker will stress more and more the longer they try to think of the best choice to make. This is especially true to adolescents when they are a few years away from adulthood. However, relieving this stress has no simpler solution than from the helpful words of fellow advisers. Those who give the advice won't usually understand the stress the decision maker is going through which is why most of the time their advice can be all the more relieving to the decision maker. Just like stress, calmness can also build up within a person which results in smarter final decisions, not the stressful and thoughtless ones. The loss of stress can also find people working more efficiently and calmly. Although, a person can feel the stress within them, they usually intend to ignore it and don't realize the negative impact it has on their decision making. Others could easily notice this and would address this with practical but relieving advice so that the decider may focus on work rather than their conflicting emotions.

Advice from others doesn't necessarily mean it's for one decision. It can be used for future ones and even inspire a decision maker to give it to another. Statistics show that ninety-one percent of those who received advice from others applied it regularly for other problems. Of those nine-one percent of people, around eighty-percent of them shared it with others. These statistics are groundbreaking and show the vast benefits multiple opinions can have on someone. Not only that but advice from others can get people out of the habit of having a closed mindset and offer them new opportunities. From the beginning advice from others has played a big role in shaping the present and will continue to do so for the future. This is only possible however, if people are willing to be less stubborn and listen to others for a change rather than only themselves.

In conclusion the points from above show that advice from other provides many benefits and opportunities which can lead to better decision making. By looking at a different perspective they can identify the most beneficial decisions. Advice from others also relieves the decision maker of the traumatizing stress that builds up within them. Finally, others' advice can help you and others make better future decisions. Remember, the greatest gift from your friends is the influence and advice they have.          ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
B0C3BBF86B9B,"Whenever there is a roadblock in life, many people feel limited to who they can ask for help. They do not know that there is a tremendous number of others surrounding them ready to put forth advice. There are always people somewhere who would be willing to help with a problem. Getting help is the smartest choice to make when in need of help. Talking to multiple people will never be the wrong choice, as it will almost always provide benefits for both parties. By asking multiple friends, family members, and trusted others, for advice, new perspectives are provided, decisions are rethought, and new ideas are formed.

There is no arguing that no two alike people walk on this planet. With different people, comes an uncountable number of differing opinions on topics worldwide. When multiple opinions are acquired, a great sea of new perspectives begins to flow. For example, if there is a glass filled halfway with water, one person may say its half full, and the other may say its half empty. That shows how different perspectives can influence how people view a situation. The analogy can be applied to any type of conflict or topic that advice is needed on due to the fact that people can have different perspectives on anything. The advice that is given is influenced based on how that person views the subject. Some perspectives can be more positive based or negative based. It can also depend on someone's personality. If only one person was to be consulted for advice rather than multiple, only one side of the story is taken into account.

In many situations, judgment can easily be corrupted. This can be caused by stress, deficient energy, or maybe just a busy schedule. With a corrupted field of judgment, decisions cannot be made with complete logic. In less then two minutes, someone's life can be changed. That is all it takes for a good or bad decision to be made. A great example is speeding up to a yellow traffic light rather than slowing down. There is a risk of crashing or getting pulled over, but also getting to the destination faster. The right decision may lead to a beneficial addition to the day. However, the wrong decision may lead to something grave. When making a decision, advice is a great way to try and stay on the right path. By asking multiple people, the pieces of advice may start to persuade someone to not make a certain decision or to make a different choice. The process of rethinking something is always good because if the idea is thought about again, then there is a better chance it will end up being the most intelligent option.

In some of situations, the original plan is not always the best solution. Even if advice is given from multiple people, their advice might not be what is wanted. As advice is given, sometimes combinations of many different opinions is the best suited for a specific person and topic. To be more specific, if none of the advice given is liked, then new ideas begin to spark. For instance, someone is deciding whether to buy a big box of cookies or not and they ask two people for advice. One person says to buy it, and the other says not to. If neither idea sounds right, the idea to buy a smaller box surfaces which is both pieces of advice combined. If only one piece of advice was taken then, the decision could have been completely different and had a different consequence.

In conclusion, making the right decision is crucial for many aspects in life. Some of these aspects include happiness and success. In order to do that, advice from multiple people is needed. Advice is always beneficial from everyone when it comes to making the right choice. In some situations, advice can be more crucial than others but it is needed in all types of problems. It can be from friends, family, or anyone who could help give reputable advice. When multiple people put forth opinions, new perspectives are provided, decisions are rethought, and new ideas are formed.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
C7CEFE3F256D,"As being human nobody is perfect and we don't know everything. This is why we need to ask others but even then sometimes they can be wrong. Getting good advice can sometimes be a challenge, so asking more people is probably a better choice then only asking one person. Looking for advice from multiple people apposed from one person is better because it shows multiple views of the topic, gives a greater understanding on why the advice will work, and includes different experiences of the topic.

Getting multiple views on the topic clears up that there is not any bias coming from a persons advice. What is a bias? Bias is a positive or negative opinion that someone has to an object, place, or person. Bias is not good for giving advice because it sometimes can shows a wrongful or untrue statement about the topic. Multiple views also gives the person more then one way to handle the topic and use different approaches to the situation. An example of bias is views on a person. One person might think someone is mean because of their first impression. Another person might be their best friend and say they are amazing, but both of these opinions are biased because of the way they have interacted with the person. It would be best to find a third party opinion who does not have a biased thought towards the person.

The next reason why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one person is it gives a greater understanding on why the advice will work. Two people might give the same advice, but give different reasons on how it will work. This can show a variety of knowledge on the concept and give even more ways to approach the situation. In conclusion, asking more people for advice is more knowledgeable because of the different reasons people give for why their own advice will work.

The last way getting multiple peoples advice is better is that different people have different experiences. This means that people have had a scramble of atmospheres of the topic. It mostly applies to places and people not objects. An example is a person deciding on going to a water park. When asking one person they might say that it was very boring and not very exciting, so then they go ask another person and they said they had an amazing time and it's their favorite place to go. Both of the people went to the water park and had different experiences on how it went. It was really just their personal preference and the only way is to go to it yourself to see how it is.

Receiving multiple people for advice is shown to be better then just asking one person because multiple views on the topic clears up any biased that a person has, a greater understanding of the topic because the different reasons on why they advice will work, and multiple experiences that people have had show a variety thoughts when going to a place. Just remember when seeking advice many people have different views and opinions about certain topics.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
9D0934987831,"people ask for others opinions all the time, when people ask for more than one opinion its to make a better judgment of what they're asking. Choosing a president, a doctors opinion, making friends are all examples of asking for more than one person opinions.

When choosing a president everyone has their own opinion on who they think will make the country better, so people vote for them. Some people even try to persuade others to vote for this person then they give their reason/opinion to why they should vote for them. Then there's other people who disagree with others, and will share why they think that president shouldn't become president. Everyone makes their own opinion and choosing a president is an important one to make because you have to make sure that they make smart decisions, and care about the people and not the title.

When you ask for a doctors opinion your asking for your health to make sure that your body is functioning the way its supposed to. Making sure that theres nothing wrong with your body. But when there is something wrong a doctor would usually tell you to take this and you should do this to help your body out a little bit, or if its serious than they will tell you that you should get surgery. one doctors opinion isnt always right, so you go and a second opinion from another doctor to make sure that it is 100% certain

Making friends is hard especially when it comes to teenagers, because theres rumors there she/he did that, drama,she/he is ugly or they're poor. Teenagers make it so hard to make friends cause if you hang out with a certain person it makes you just like them. Some teens are so opinionated to the point it starts to count as harassment or bullying. Also if your trying to make some more friends and depending on who your friend is they might not like the fact you want to make new friends so you ask around people that you know for their opinion what should you do if you should befriend the person or stay friends with them. Thats why i think asking for other people opinions matter.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
4ACB29936C94,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, And I think that is fine. asking more than one person can give you different point of views on a subject, one person might not be as smart or wise on the subject that you asked advice for so asking more than one person could solve that issue, and if you ask multiple people and many of them say the same thing you might have already found which advice is the right one.

When you ask many different people chances are, you will have many different point of views, but I think the more options the better, it's like asking advice for what cereal to buy, you ask many people and get many options, each person telling you why you should buy a certain cereal and eventually you will find the one that makes the most sense, the cheapest cereal with the biggest box and not too much sugar. If you only asked one person for one cereal to buy you would almost automatically buy that cereal because someone told you it's the best.

Asking one person advice might not be a good idea, that person might not be the smartest or the wisest when it comes tho the topic you are asking advice for or that person could just be giving you bad advice. If you ask ""hey when should I do my homework day or night"" to many people, some might know when is the best time because they have done both whether if you ask one person they might just say night because that's when they do it or the day it's due or asking even serious topics like ""how do I deal with parents getting a divorce"" If you asked me and me only I wouldn't know what to tell you because I have never experienced that before, but if you asked more than one person someone might have the answer, many might have different answers or options on the topic.

let's say you asked multiple people for the same advice, advice on cereal again, even if the answer is not clear an other factor you can add in is the majority rule, Just see which option is brought up the most and take that into consideration. this could be important because If you ask one person like ""hey do you think I should do the homework later"" that one person that you asked could just say ""no don't do it"" basically giving you bad advice, unlike if you ask multiple people, most would tell you to do it which is good advice.

In conclusion it is better to ask multiple people advice on something because that way you can get different point of views, some people might have experienced what you asked for therefore have the best solution, and you could see if most said one answer. It is important to have different options and to not Google everything because Google isn't the answer to everything believe it or not.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
E3DB63C503FC,"Why does a person ask multiple people when seeking for advise? When people ask for advise, they sometimes talk to more than one person. There are many advantages for asking multiple people when seeking for advise. Asking multiple people can help a person make a better choice because it helps him or her understand the better options and different possibilities when solving a problem.

Having better options can help a person make a better choice. For example, high school students can ask their teachers or parent about what college to attend. Their parents and teacher might have different opinions on different colleges. As parents, they might want their children to find a college thats closer to them and teachers might give options that relates to the students' high school courses. The high school student can listen to their advises and better decide which college to attend.

People's minds think differently. If a person ask more than one person with a math problem, they might have different ways to solve the problem. It helps the person see the different possibilities of ways to solve the problem. The person can understand the different ways and see which is best for them so that next time they can use that method to find the best answer.

When seeking for advise, it's best to ask multiple people. When asking multiple people, a person can see the different way of solving a problem and it helps them understand the best options. That's why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.         ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
4CAE60F391E8,"It's always beneficial to ask different people for a solution to the problem you may have. Asking other people for help can help you make a good decision, different people may have more experience, and they might have more than one solution or idea.

Talking to multiple people can help you make a wise decision. You can talk with family, friends, or even the councilor at your school. These different people can help you make a decision that you won't regret in the future. Some people don't trust themselves into making a decision, so they ask others for their help. Not only should you ask yourself what you should do, but you should also ask others for their opinions.

Asking different people can help you make a beneficial choice because different people may have more experience. When people ask for others help, they often don't have experience with the situation they are dealing with. For example, you are in a fight with your friend and don't know what to do. You ask your Mom for help and take her advice. You and your friend sort things out and become friends again. Talking with an adult could help you make a strong and wise decision. Older people are often called wise because they have dealt with experiences before. Experience is key when you are asking someone for advice.

When you talk to more than one person, each person might have multiple solutions or ideas. This can be beneficial because you don't want to make the wrong decision. You can ask others for their opinions on a solution you have, and see if they say yes, or no. Different ideas can also make it hard to make a decision. Some can be confused on what each person say and don't know what to do. It's best to go with a solution that others think you should do and what you think you should do.

Asking others for advice can help you make the most beneficial decision possible, each person may have different ideas to the problem, and others may have dealt with the situation before. The best way to ask someone for advice is to ask someone that you trust. Asking teachers, friends, or family for advice, is advice you can trust. Advice can come in different shapes and sizes. You just need to know what will be the best decision for you, and for you alone.       ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
99F04B521CFA,"Have you ever asked someone for advice and when you took it it ended up being a bad idea. If you ever ask one person for advice and your not sure about it ask more people about it and see if you get the same advice as the first person. Asking multiple people for help can make the advise more valid and the next time you ask for advice you know which people to go to.

one reason you should ask multiple people is because it makes the advice more believable. Have you ever asked someone for advice on something, like telling the truth on something you did, and the first person you ask tells you to lie, you should ask other people if you're not sure. If the majority of the people tell you to tell the truth then you should go with that. Although, sometimes its not always like that because you could ask someone you've known for a long time and he knows you well, and he tells advice on something and you ask other people who dont know you very well and they tell you another thing, you should go with the person who knows you better.

Another reason you should ask multiple people for advice is because you'll know which people to go to for advice.

For example, you could ask multiple people on different advice and the people who consistently get different answers from the majority of people who give the same advice, you probably should not ask for their advice. If you ask someone for advice and they tell you something that might not be good, but you go with it any way you could get in trouble and you'll know not to ask that person for advice ever again. If you ask for a lot of people and know which kind of advice they give you know who to go to when you need advice.

Asking the opinions of other people on things you need help with is a good idea because it makes the advice you get from one person more valid and you'll know which people to go to when you need advice. And some times there will always be one person who will tell you bad advice. But the good thing is that at least you'll learn from it.  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
0191274639A4,"when people is asking for an advice most people ask more than one person why do you think it helps them make better choices. There are a lot of persons with more experience then other. Why do you think that, well I have some reasons that explains, why most people ask more then one person.

One of the reasons is that you are not shore about the advice this person gave you and you ask like your grandpa.

And your grandpa says the same thing now you be more convince of what the first person tolled you. also you be like that person was right of what he told me and later you be asking him for more advice and he will be Abel to help you.

The second Reason is if someone you ask dose not know the other person might know what advice to give you Also it can help you a lot and if you don't believe this person you go and ask some other Peron and after you will realize that the advice was a great advice and you will feel better.

Also the third reason is that one person can have more expierense then other you can ask a kid of your age and they might not know what to say. But if you ask a adult they might know but mostly the persons that might know more are your grandparents. because they have lived more in this world and a lot of stuff might of happen to them so that why. I think that the persons that knows more about advice are your grandparents your grandma your grandpa or maybe your mom or dad but mostly your grandparents.

So that what I think of that why you should ask more then one person I give you the reasons aged One is because more then one or two persons or even more can convince you of the advice the first told you. Two is if the first person you told dose not know maybe the other person can know what to say to you. the tired one is that one person has more experience then the other one like a senor can know more then a kid well he defenetly knows more then a kid because a kid just stared living his life and a adult and a senor have been living more time then a child perhaps yes a teen can know more about technology but a adult has more expirens those are my reason you should ask for more then one person oppinon so you can be shour of the advice and yourself.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
FF9202FAA566,"How many people do you ask for opinions when you need help? Many people seek multiple opinions when needing help. There are many reasons why you would want to seek different opinions. These reasons include, getting more than one perspective, someone may have gone through something similar, someone may have more knowledge in that area.

Have you ever asked a negative friend their opinion on something? Relating to that, have you ever asked a positive friend their outlook on something? The opinions probably varied drastically. Many people have different perspectives than others. For example, yesterday I asked my positive friend if I should curl or straighten my hair, she said,""It doesn't matter, you'll look great either way!"" Then I asked my negative friend what they think I should do and he said, ""It doesn't matter, I don't see why you do your hair for school anyway."" As you can see the opinions varied drastically according to each outlook.

Another notable reason why you should get more than one opinion is because someone may have gone through something similar. Someone may have been in the same situation as you. For instance, if you are having a baby and you need to decide whether to have it at the hospital or a natural birth. You probably want to ask someone that has been through natural child birth and someone that has been through hospital child labor. You wouldn't want to ask someone that has never had a child what to do.

When you ask someone for their opinion you want them to have knowledge in that area. For example, if you ask someone about the cough and runny nose you have their mind might jump to a cold. Meanwhile if you ask a doctor, they might test you for the flu. In this case, the doctor has more experience, therefore it's good that you got their opinion also.

As you can see, there are many reasons why getting a second or third opinion wouldn't hurt. Many people everywhere in the world reach to others for their opinions on situations, whether their opinion is professional or not. Next time you need an opinion on something, try going to some one else about it and see if the problem was solved easier or harder. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
D4CF0DF858F1,"Looking back on that last tough decision, do you wish there was someone there to help guide you or tell you if that was the best thing to do? No one can tell you what's right or wrong but they can lend you advice instead. I believe that seeking advice and opinions from others can help you make a better, more educated choice because they can have more experience, help you focus on the main goal, and give more straightforward, emotionless advice.

In certain situations, making the correct decision is tough, however, most people are not exactly alone in making that decision. Even though, it's a new problem to one person, it could be an old one to someone else. If it is, that person could help guide the other person into making a better decision than maybe the one they made. For instance, college. Choosing which college to go to isn't exactly a light decision and some may ask for advice on which one to choose. By asking others who have had to make related decisions about college, they can give you more information on why or why not something is better or worse because they have the prior knowledge. Most decisions aren't new decisions. Others have most likely gone through the same thing and asking for their opinions can help you make a better choice.

Another reason is that while deciding something, people can get distracted by the little things and other people can help them get back on track. The simple question of, ""Will that help you reach your goal?"" can open their eyes to see the bigger picture once more. Sometimes getting that reality check is all you need to make the best decision. Everyone's future is different but it is inevitable and listening to advice from others could help better or worsen that future.

In some situations, our own judgment can get clouded easily by emotion. We can make rash decisions because we aren't thinking straight or are getting distracted by superficial things. In these situations, receiving honest advice from others can help you come to the realization of what's really important. It is easy to make decisions based on your emotions but sometimes those decisions aren't the best and could even create more problems for you later on. Asking for the opinions of others can help you make the better choice.

Most people have made a decision they've regretted and probably would've done differently if they have known it resulted in the way it did. They probably wish there was someone there that could've given them the advice to make a different decision. In conclusion, I believe that asking for multiple opinions can be beneficial to your decision-making because others can provide prior knowledge on a certain topic, help you stay on the correct path, and give you honest, needed feedback. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Also it gives you more of an understanding from the other person. Another reason is it gives you more accurate reasons then just one persons. If you need help then usually more then one person's opinion would help. But say you give someone an example then of your friend's or someone close,that you trust they would give there honesty. Another reason is if you have more then one person you trust then they wouldn't lie neither would they tell. Usually if you ask more then one person the same question, you might get the same answers or some what close to the same answers. To add on to that would sum everything down into one. Now say if you ask someone for advice they could be lying or just not know, so that's why if you ask more then one person for advice that would help. But usually if you need help or advice ask an adult cause they've more then likely have had the same questions as you.

F704BCDD5FC4,"Once there was a period in my life when I was to scared to ask anyone for advice,

I was stuburn and only wanted to do things my way.

But through my expireances I now know that it is best to get advice from multiple people because well some people are older and wiser, also someone you trust would give great advice, and finally its just good to have more than one opinion to choose from.

As you get older and go through life you get more wise and knowlageable.

When ever I need advice I tend to also ask my parents, grandparents and even friends parents.

Because I know that they have been through more than I have and are likely to have good advice on what I am looking for.

Older siblings could be a great option too because they went through school and have been stressed about school work and they know how to deal with that stuff.

For example last year I was reall stressed about my math sol so I asked my sister for advice and she told me don't worry about if you pass or not just know that you did your best and thats all that matters.

Most people when they need advice they don't go to a random stranger for advice because you don't know or trust them so how do you expect to believe what they tell you.

People you trust are more than likely to trust you too and want the best for you and your life so they will give you the best advice they can provide.

You can also build bonds with people and keep going back to them for advice. My sister and I have build a really strong bond and we trust each other with anything from advice on school work to even advice on drama and stuff like that.

If you don't trust the person giving you advice then you don't know if they are giving you the best advice.

If you don't get more than one opinion you just have one to choose from and you may not think its the best for you.

But if you get multiple then you can choose the best one for you.

Also some people don't give the best advice for what you are looking for.

Some people are better at giving advice than others and once you find the best option for you, you can go with that.

For instance a few years back I asked someone for advice and they didn't know what was best for me but something that they said has stuck with me since don't be scared to go out of you confort zone and ask a school conceler or someone that you are close with.

When some people ask for advice they sometimes go to more than 1 person.

Askng multiple people could help in many ways to seek the best choice for you.

If you go to people that are wiser and elder have more expieriance, people you know and trust and finally its good to have more than one opinion to choose from.

You are trying out for the NFL to be a defensive lineman and having problems tackling the opponent so you ask for some advice. The first person you ask doesn't even play football he tells you to keep trying your best. You aren't satisfied with his answer so you ask someone else. The second person tells you to run after the person with the ball and get as close as you can then tackle them. You try the first persons advice but you fail. So you try the second persons advice and your drafted into the NFL. See it is all about having more opinions. If you had only asked person number one you wouldn't have been drafted, but you asked two people and got drafted.

Your trying to climb a difficult rock wall but you keep falling off their are 4 other people their you ask all of them for advice. The first person tells you to spread your foot and hand holds out a little. The second person tells you to always make sure you have a firm grip on your new hand hold before trying to find foot holds. the third person tells you to keep practicing. The forth person tells you to do what person 1 and 2 told you but added to make sure hand holds and foot holds are the right size for you to grip. You try person number fours advice because it sounded right to you. This time you make it all the way up the Rockwell. Because you asked more than one persons advice you found the right piece of advice you were looking for. Person 1 and 2 had good advice but number 4s advice was in more detail.

Their is a chicken a dog and a fox you need to cross a deep river with all the animals to. Their is a small row boat but it can't hold ll the weight at once. You don't know how you should do it but their are three other people near you that you could ask. The first person tells you to take the chicken across first then the fox lastly the dog. The second person tells you to take the dog first the chicken second and the fox third. The third person tells you to take the fox first the chicken second and the dog last. You think about it and decide on person number threes advice it works and you continue your journey. You choose the third persons advice because you if you took the dog first the fox would have attacked the chicken. If you took the chicken first the dog would have attacked the fox. By taking the fox first the chicken second and the dog last you succeeded.

My conclusion is that having more than one opinion is good because it allows for different points of view. With only one opinion it could be right or it could be wrong. With multiple points of view you have more data to pick from. More freedom to choose what you think is right. It opens your eyes to different ways of thinking and different ways of doing things. Which allows you to apply that to the things you do in life. Just like you wouldn't eat only the same thing for the rest of your life you.

You wouldn't want only one opinion either. Diversity of opinion is just as important.  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
9B5AC9A7914F,"When people ask for advice, people sometimes talk to more than one person. When asking for advice, it is always good to ask more than one person because if you were only to ask one, you may not get as clear of information as you would from asking multiple individuals. You should always ask at least two people about advice because it opens your mind up to see two different opinions. This will allow you to hear both the positives and the negatives of the situation. One person may be nice all the time and only tell you the things you want to hear, and one may be super truthful, telling you the things you may not want to hear, but are very beneficial. If you were to only ask advice from one person, you may not get the advice you're looking for.

If an individual were to go an ask a really nice person, who always says nice things and only tells a person what they want to hear, then they may get a response they love and decide not to go and ask anybody else. Only hearing advice from a nice person is good because an individual may have more confidence in themselves and feel better about how there are as a person. The nice individual may say something nice to someone, but may not always mean it. If that were the case, then the opinion a person receives from them might not be useful, and that they might be setting themselves up for failure. So when asking a nicer person, you might have to consider the fact that they might not being telling you their honest opinion. They might only be telling you what you would want to hear.

Now if an individual goes to an honest person and asks them for advice, they will most likely hear a very detailed version of what that person thinks of the situation. It is always good to ask someone nice about what they think of a situation, but it is also good to ask someone who will give you the honest truth. When asking this person about their opinion, they will tell you their honest opinion, regardless of what you want to hear, which could end up with a persons feelings getting hurt. Going to this person may be beneficial, but that person may need to be prepared for some constructive criticism. If an individual cannot receive constructive criticism without breaking down and crying, or taking the advice to emotionally, then it would be best to not ask that person for advice. Although it may be tough to hear what they are telling you, it will most likely be the best advice someone can give you.

When asking two individuals about advice, they should always try to hear both sides of advice. It is always good to ask multiple people about advice because the more people you ask, the better advice you will receive. Some people may have great things to say, while others may not. It may not be what you want to hear, but you should always take everyone's opinion into consideration. The more people a person can ask, the better information that person will gather. Also that person will be more confident about the situation or decision because they will have heard opinions from both sides. Then the individual can sum up the people's opinions and make a final decision. That is why when for advice, it is always good to talk to more than one person.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
92DB57DCD12B,"Advice is needed a lot in life, and when it is needed seeking multiple people for advice is very helpful. Seeking multiple people for advice is very helpful for making a better choice because it gives more overall information and more points of view. when you ask only one person you only receive one point of view and much less information overall, which in the end may be faster but it is less helpful when you need advice.

When you get advice from multiple people it gives you multiple points of views. This is very helpful because it gives different ways to think, and it can also change your mind about what advice you are looking for. When you speak to multiple people it puts you in other peoples shoes and hearing advice from multiple people can make you feel different about the advice your looking for. you could be researching and be stuck to one point of view, but after hearing multiple people, your opinion could completely change.

Another reason to ask more people when looking for advice is there will be more overall information gathered. When you talk with multiple people it helps you understand what you are looking for because you hear more information which helps greatly when you need advice. Looking to multiple people for advice is also helpful just because it will let you know more about what you are looking for, or it will just let you understand what your looking to find better.

talking to multiple people is very helpful when you are looking for advice, because you get more points of view and you get more overall information for advice. There is very little reason to only look to one person for advice when you can look to a few, because with one person you get less information and only one point of view, but with multiple you learn what multiple people believe and you get much more information which will help you much more in the long term. advice is something needed lots in life, but this is why you should ask multiple people when looking for advice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
DBD25468A540,"When you don't know something, you ask someone. It is what everyone tells you to do, ask questions. Well most of the time you ask more than one person. Why? When i'm trying to get information from a person I look at their experience, viewpoint, and also for accurate results. It gives people more ideas to think of on a topic.

I look at their experience because it gives me a better idea of what the person is like or has been through. For example if their family is democratic and I ask this person if I should vote for a republican, they will most likely say not to vote for the republican because of their experience with their family. If it is an issue like skydiving and I want to do it but i'm not sure. I will ask someone who has been skydiving for advice, because they have been through it and they tell me what I would expect. Maybe I ask a person for advice on something and they know a person that went through the same thing I am. When i'm sick I want to know what it's going to be like, so I would ask my friend who has a family member that has had this sickness and they would tell me what to expect.

Another reason why seeking multiple peoples opinions is for looking at their viewpoints. When you have your opinion on an issue you want other people to see your way or feel the way you do about the issue. So when you ask more than one person you are seeing the other persons viewpoint. This is why you should ask multiple people for their opinions. They also might be bias towards the issue because someone else told them their opinion and they now agree with that and really don't like the other issue so they like theirs so much. If you have multiple people to talk to you will have each persons different viewpoints and you will be able to look at the pros and cons, then you will be able to decide on what you think.

When you talk to more people the more accurate the results get because the amount of people. If you are only talking to one person. You only have persons opinion to go by and you don't know if their are more ways or ideas on how to do that thing. Different people know might know more things than just one person, for example if you talk to a smarter person they will know more than a person not as smart. When you are talking to more people the wider the results and more accurate they get. It is a positive correlation, which means if you have more different variety of people the more accurate and better the results.

If you still think that talking to one person is better than talking to multiple just remember. When you talk to more than one person you look at their experience, viewpoint and when talking to different people it gives you more accurate results. So next time you have a question or want to know an opinion on something. Ask multiple people it is the best thing you can do.                                                     ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
897004C788FB,"In a Presidential vote, does the country ask only one person about who they want for president, or the whole country? You could only imagine what only having one person's opinion could do to this country. Having people vote as a whole seems to be very beneficial to America, and may be beneficial to you as well. Sometimes it is better to have multiple people state their opinion before you make a big decision. You should seek advice from multiple people because it will help make your choice easier, give you different viewpoints, and improve the outcome of your decision.

Making decisions by yourself gets hard and stressful at times. Seeking other's opinions on the subject may make your decision a lot easier. This takes some stress out of your choice because then you know what the majority thinks. At the end of the day it is still your choice to make, regardless of what anyone thinks or says. There are an endless amount of decisions that people seek personal opinions on no matter how serious. When you're going out to eat with a group you ask them where they want to go. The NFL or NBA Most Valuable Player isn't chosen by just one person, it's asked about by fans, coaches, and players to see who the majority thinks deserves it. Now this does not guarantee the right choice will be made, but in the past it has proven that it has the potential to be helpful.

Asking of multiple people's opinions on a subject offers different viewpoints to the situation. These different viewpoints could really effect your on view on a decision. Many people make poor choices because they are biased towards what they think is right. Most likely you will not get the same opinion and view on a situation over and over again. No matter how you look at it it's beneficial. Either you receive the same view over and over and it makes your decision very clear, or you get different viewpoints and a new way to look at the situation.

With the help of trustworthy and honest peers, your decision is a lot more dependable. Hearing what others believe to be true tends to help. You have to remember to ask trustworthy people, and even then your decision may not be a good one. Even some of the smartest people in America, including our president, congress, and all of the houses ask for opinions from the people. Sure a few bad choices have been made, but I strongly feel the good heavily outweigh the bad. I also believe that the good outweigh the bad on even tiny decisions made day to day when you have multiple different perspectives. You can't go wrong with other people's help on choices no matter how big or small.

You should seek advice from multiple people because it will help make your choice easier, give you different viewpoints, and improve the outcome of your decision. It is truly better to ask around for help on a topic then choose on your own. The are way more benefits than downfalls. For instance, out of all the presidents we have ever had, we've had many good ones and few bad ones. With different perspectives you can either add to your argument or see through another persons eyes on why they think what they think. Would you rather take the risk of making a poor choice or receive insight on what you should really do?",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
7221D7BD4111,"Do you ask more than one person for advice. I think that asking more than one person for advice can help you figure out what you really want. If you just ask one person about your problem, he or she can tell you a bad way to handle it, and you'll listen to he or she cause thats the only person you have asked. If you ask more than one person you have all these different suggestions you can choose from, and you can pick the one that sounds the best. You should ask more than one person for advice because you have lots of choices to choose from after seeking advice from others, you are not worried that much anymore, and if you ask one person the outcome won't be good.

You should always ask more than one person. If you ask lots of people for advice about your problem you will have more choices to choose from. By having more choices to choose from you can look at all the advice people told you and see which one is the best or stood out he most to you. Some of the advice you get may be good or bad thats why you ask lots of people. By not asking lots of people you have less choices to choose from.

When you have lots of different choices to choose from you arent that worried anymore. When having lots of different choices to your problem it relives stress. You can get all the thinking of your head, the headaches can all be gone thanks to having a lot of ideas of advice to choose from. Say one of the advises you choose to use to solve your problem dosen't work, you have a lot more so you don't get stressed over it. Getting stressed over something can lead you to not do it anymore and quitting is not the right way to end something.

If you only ask one person for advice on something that will not be good at all. Asking one person for advice is not good because what if there advice is horrible but thats the only person you asked and you go with there idea anyway. If you dont ask other people for advice and just have only option of advice it might not go so well to solving your problem. If the problem your having is a really big problem you probally need to ask lots of people not just one person .

You should ask more than one person cause it will help you with your problem big time. If you ask just one person for advice won't do anything for you. You're less stressed out if you ask more people for advice cause if you ask one person for advice and that advice fails you will get super stressed out. You need to ask at leat like seven people for advice in my opion cause thats enough to see which one rally stands out the most. You should ask more than one person beacuse you have lots of choices to choose from after seeking advice from others, you are not worried that much anymore, and if you ask one person the outcome won't be good.                ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
CC3E52BD8711,"When people ask for advice they usually ask one person, but when they do that, their choices are limited compared to when they ask multiple people for their advice in a situation. They then can hear different points of view as they hear where other people went wrong and their experiences in that time, and how to avoid that situation. This then allows them to assess the conflict and then do what most people described as helpful.

If you ask multiple people for their opinions on it then you can get many different answers or you can get a bunch of the same answers to help your point. For instance, if you are having problems with a girl and you ask boys and girls what to do then they will give you different answers based on the fact that they have opposite views on the conflict. Girls will make it seem like you did wrong and will try to make you feel bad but when you ask ""the boys"" it makes it seem like you did no wrong and your girlfriend is mad about something else completely unrelated to that topic. But if you ask on a different topic to that thought, then you could get very, very different answers.

Like when you are going to get a brand new pair of shoes but then you don't know what to get, so you ask your friends. They then proceed and say, Parrel x Adidas Human Races, Checkerboard Vans, Old Skool Vans, Yeezy Boosst 350, or some New Balance Running shoes. Who ever you ask on a really big topic then you are going to get a wide variety of answers, some which you most likely wouldn't want to hear because of your own opinion.

It could also be if you ask them which is their favorite sport, they could say, Baseball, Football, Soccer, Volleyball, Golf, Bowling, Swimming, Hockey, Boxing, WWE, Wrestling, Fishing, etc. With this amount of options it really makes it hard to get a straight answer from the people you ask.

Also, if you need help to a math problem, not everyone is going to get the same answer. People could get 130in, 126in, 134in, 100in, 167in, and so on. If you don't get any of these then you probably will try it yourself so you can see what you got and see where everyone else went wrong.

People ask for advice so they don't seem like they are absolutely stupid and they are incorrect all the time. Advice is asked for when, asking out a girl, making food, playing a sport, mowing the lawn, etc. Advice is important because it helps people understand where they went wrong and how they can prevent someone else from going wrong.

People always asked more than one person for advice. They tend to ask more people because,it helps them get good reasons,keeps count as the vote wether or not it could be a good idea,and lastly,they learn new things along the way..

First reason to why people ask multiple people for advice is giving good reasons. There's many reasons people give out that you might've not thought about. An example could be,instead of buying a phone,you can trade it to the company and they'll give you a brand new one. Another reason to why people ask multiple people for adive is because,other people also give out the pros and cons about the topic. An example would be,the new features in the phone aren't great,but it's good quality for photos. In conclusion,people give out good reasons that you may or may not have thought about.

Second reason as to why people ask more than one person for advice is beacuse they keep count as to people who agree and who doesn't. Most of the time people like to keep count as to what's good, or what's bad. An example could be,they choose not to get a new phone cause more people said no. And that is why people care about the amount of people who said yes or no. In conclusion,people like to make it as competition to see if it's a good reason or not.

Lastly,they learn new things along the way. Instead of buying the Iphone Xr,they should wait until the new phone comes out in a couple of months. Or,download google photos to save you more storage instead of buying another phone,a last example would be using it with family. It gives more GB because they add every member of your family's GB,which makes it give people more storage. A lot of people probably didn't knew this until a worker for the the company says it.

To begin with, they can tell you what they did wrong, so you will not do the same thing. If the person wants to do something good they would ask people for advice so they will not do it wrong. They would tell them what they did wrong, so that he or she will do it right. For example, one day Generic_Name went to his friends what not to do at his wedding his friends started telling what not to do, so he did as they said and his wedding went perfect.

Also, you can see their point of view. When someone is asking more than one person, because some people do it differently than others. Not everyone look at something the same way others do the have different points of view. They ask multiple people, so the can have an idea of what to do and what not to do. For example, Generic_Name went to ask his friends for advice but all of them had different story's but they had something's in common so that gave him an idea of what to do and what not to do.

Have you ever put on a beautiful long dress, but than think to yourself, do I look too fat in this, did my thighs just get larger? The next step you take is called a step back. You ring up some of your close friends to see what they think about your dress. Some may give they're honest opinion, while others may just lie so when you wear your dress to prom you look like a fool. That is why it important to ask more than one person so you get different points of views, figure out your next steps, and help put your steps to action.

An important aspect when trying to seek for multiple opinions is when you get different point of views. Asking just one person will do you no benefit, but when asking multiple you get a sense of what to do next. In reference, knocking on one door does nothing, but when you knock on many doors you get a whole lot of benefits. Asking many people benefits you because each person gives you different advice. When you collect all the advice it can help you look your best.

While seeking for different opinions is good, so is looking for your next steps. You may have gotten multiple points of views, but next you have to seek for your next steps. Sometimes your friends or family tell you what to do next, but sometimes you have to problem solve and figure it out yourself. You may need to look between the lines and find the best solution for yourself. Next steps can involve exercising or even toning down some of your makeup.

Putting you next steps into action is very important so you can look your best on prom night. When it comes to exercising you should exercise everyday for at least forty-five minutes or more. When exercising it's important to have at least three to five nutrition based foods. Nutrition based foods can involve dairy, protein, vegetables, fruits and many more. When it comes to toning down some makeup you should either find someone to show you how to or find a good video that shows you step by step how to put on light natural makeup on your face.

Seeking for opinions makes a better choice because it gives you different points of views of others, leads you to your next steps, and shows you how to put your steps into action. Just remember when stuck in a situation where you have to ask for advice don't hesitate because asking advice is not bad at all. Advice will lead you to what you need to do next and help you. When you don't get multiple opinion's of others you could be stuck in a situation where others are laughing at you.

B73FE4F761D2,"When someone is in desperate, urgent need of guidance, just one person may not have the answer. To achieve the most dependable help, one must access different sources. Requesting many diverse perspectives will help a person make the best decision because it will present them with more options and suggest the logicality behind their own ideas.

As more assistance is sought out, more feedback will be received. For starters, it is important that everyone's viewpoint is considered before finalizing your own, because a peer may have a wiser alternative. As I once trapped myself between a wall of choices, I was indecisive beyond imaginable; however, my mother came to me with a brand new thought that I had never conjured as a possibility. I soon followed through with her recommendation and was well on my way across the blockade that I had once stumbled upon.

Also, when given multiple thoughts, the ability is there for the seeker to choose which one they prefer. No matter whom is asked, every adviser will have an opinion on the situation the learner possesses. As a result, it is possible to debate the pros and cons of any given suggestion to reach an ultimate solution.

Another example is the availability of compiling every resolution that is offered. There is no requirement for someone in distress to choose only one; therefor, it is always reasonable to form one's own method of progress using what they have already thought of as well as heard. This strategy will build a bridge between all helpful spoken words of helpers.

Considering this, the most effective conclusion is not one that comes only from the viewpoints of one person.

The motivation and speech that the scouter is presented with will question the reasoning for future actions that they would have tried to complete.

Additionally, only by pointing out the reasons certain things are better than another will anyone see why they truly are. Discussing specific matters with those who are around will open the door to the realization of the successes that have been a result before. These positives outweigh the negatives and compel people to utilize their processes.

Not to mention the experience that has created the viewpoints of others. From their own hardships and struggles, mentors will know what is a credible thing to go by. Being taught about the things these people went through will assure the listener that there are more rational things to do. Using the past decisions of elders as a format for one's own will offer assistance in the improvement of an open mind's supposed best way to solve a problem.

Finally, by explaining to others one's own plans, those who are willing to help can express the inevitable downfalls when proceeding with that plan. To any given person, it is difficult to see the flaws in what they thought of to be one of the most magnificent things they had ever contemplated. It is much less difficult to recognize the fatalities that will arise from such things when the composer is not their own judge. By bringing awareness to these dangers and failures, both people can discover what causes the disadvantages and work to formulate something of better benefit.

Knowing the effects of countless diverse future and past attempts will encourage someone to rethink their own.

A reasonable method becomes clear when a young mind uses the chance to ponder numerous alternatives because they serve as additional viewpoints as well as the opportunity to find the stability in previously devised possibilities. In the end, what one thinks is best will be what they want to do. For their own well being, every source should be consulted and always thought over.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

There are many people who you could like a family member or your friends cause those who are the people are the closets to you.

When looking for different people's advises, you want them to see your perspective and see which is the best choice you can do or sometimes maybe you wanna buy a car. You wanna get friends opinion on whether you should buy a car or not cause getting their opinions will help make the best decision. I think it would better to ask a friend for their opinion when making a financial decision cause maybe you have a friend that already has a car. You could ask that friend what its like to get car and the steps to it and they could tell whether its a good decision or not. Sometimes a friends decision might not be that helpful so you could ask your family like your parents or siblings.

Families are better to get an advice because youre parents are the people who already went through what you are going through so they could give you the best advice on how to be better. For example, when making life decision, I think its best to go to a family member because those are the people who can really help you. Maybe you wanna choose a college you wanna go to but you don't where to go, you could ask a sibling our parents where could be the best place for you to go and tell you how its like to go to college. You may have an older sibling who went to college and graduated, so you can ask them how its like to be in college and what are the goods and bad and give you advice on how to get through college without it being hard for you. Some siblings could even recommend you to go to the military or army, anything related to that because there are benefits to that and help you with school.

When you ask multipule people their opinon they will most likely all have diffrent advice for you baced on their past experiences.

Getting advice from lost of people help us get through some bad hair days or tough situations, like fights with your loved ones. Seeking advice from more than just one person is helpful for solving situations because it gives you different opinions, helps you figure out what opinions most people agree on, and what you might not want to do in certain situations.

Getting advice from more than just one person gives you a lot of opinions. Everyone has their own way to handle situations or problems. So some people's opinions can be very similar to yours or the complete opposite. This can open up your mind on not just one problem, but many more in the future. It can be as simple as what chips should I get? Your friend might say a chip flavor that you would never try in a million years, but you try it out and turns out you like it! This opens up your mind in situations and how to handle them in different ways.

Another thing you learn is what opinions most people have in common. You hear a lot of advice from people but some of advice can be extremely similar to each other. This can help you find a good way on how to fix situations. It shows what most people agree on, and usually that is what can help you solve your situation the best. You tend to use advice that most people agree on so asking multiple people help you with what to do in tough situations.

Lastly some of the advice you receive you just don't think fits you or the way you like to handle things so you ask more people. Say you have drama between you and someone else, someone you ask might say fight that person but that's not really the way you want to handle it. So instead you ask more people for what they think you should do. This can help bring your mind to how you want to fix a situation. Everyone handles situations differently so this will can give you ideas on what to do and what not to do.

Seeking advice from multiple help you in many ways such as, giving you different opinions, what opinions people agree most on, and what not to do in certain situations. This really helps you clear your mind on how to solve a problem correctly and how you want to solve it. It also can narrow down ways you could solve a conflict.

When your sad and and want to talk to somebody about a certain situation just tell them what's going on. Their advice could be the greatest advice you ever heard but you might need a little push so you go to somebody else and see if they could give you a different opinion on it. people should take advice from others because you will have a better outcome, they would handle it more differently, their idea could be more diverse than yours.

One reason, people should take advice from others it because you will have a better outcome. On Valentines Day, I was planning to see my boyfriend but instead i had to tell him some very bad news. My ex boyfriend kissed me that day and i couldnt help but tell my boyfriend because it wouldnt feel right if iIdidn't. So I told him and he was very angry with me because of that situation, we ended up breaking up that day but i told my friend about it and she told me i shouldn't have told him and I felt as if I should. So I went to another friend of mine and she told me, I was right for telling him because if I didn't then I wouldn't be being honest with him or with myself. That day taught me that more then one view on a subject doesnt hurt.

Another reason, people should take advice from others is because they would handle it more differently. On day, I was sitting on my bed thinking about how I wanna fight this one girl, She messed with me everyday and I just wanted to show her who's boss. So the next day, I came to school all ready to beat her up. I wanted to get advice from one of my friends and she said before you go over there think about how much attention your attracting to yourself I said your right I will calmly go over there. I thought to myself it it really worth fighting this girl in my head my mind was saying yes do it but my heart was telling me no dont do it its not worth it. So 5 listened to my heart and I sat back down. That day I was thankful for my friends for having my back and not telling me to fight her.

Finally , people should take advice from others is because their idea could be more diverse than yours. I went to the park one day because i needed to left off some steam. So I facetimed my friend to tell her that I wanted to confront this girl about talking about people behind their back and she continued to tell me about how I should confront her about her shenanigans because it was getting out of hand at this point. I told somebody else about it and they told me to confront her but don't make a scene about it. So the next day I did that and surprisingly it went well, she did apologize to the people she bullied and now they are all friends. All of this tied up to say im so glad i have people who give great advice

In conclusion, people who take advuce from others are brave because sometime I dont even have the courage to talk to some people about what i'm going through, People should take advice from others beacuse you will have a better outcome, they will handle it differently, and their idea could be more diverse than yours ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

To begin with, when your asking someone for some advice they want to make sure they are going to the right people. Some people may be better advice givers then others . For Example, when people ask me for advice i give then what they ask for but some times other people's advice can be better then mine .

Next, there are some good choice's but people want the better choice the one that do them good or get the out of a bad predicament and put them in a good one. For instance , if someone coming to me about a bad situation i am going to give them some good option for them but to them they are not good enough so they are going to go the person with the better choice .

Then, they are some good people and they might give you the exact response that you are looking for they are the people you might want to come back to when you help on deciding on something or anything like that . For Example , some people that are good people might not be good advice give but they are nice people to talk to and they might even try to help you even if they think that do not give good advice on things .

Finally, These are some reasons why you should go to more then one person for some advice , for good advice giver ,better choice , and good people because there is always a better something in the situation thats why it is good to go to more then one person .",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
D0CE35FADE7A,"Asking more than one person for advice can help you because each person you talk to won't give you the exact same advice. Every person has a different opinion and a different way of doing things. Each person will give you advice based on things that has happened to them. That's why asking different people for advice is always great help for making the right choice. You might not always agree with what advice is given to you but you need to understand that your not always going to agree with everything everyone says. Sometimes people say things that are not true. You should always ask for advice from people you trust like your parents, teachers, school counselors, aunts, uncles, grandmas, grandpas, siblings, cousins, or friends. Anyone that makes you feel good while talking. It's better to get advice from older people because they have had way more experience in life then you. Asking a grandparent or a parent will get you a better outcome. In collusion asking many people for advice is always very helpful in many different ways. ",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
38968B108FBC,"Imagine you are trying to make the biggest decision of your life. Would you ask friends and family for advice? It could help you decide or even just narrow down your options. Asking multiple people for advice when making a decision can help you pick a better choice because it can make choosing easier, you could find a new, better option, and people can share their experiences and wisdom with you.

First off, getting advice from lots of people will make it much easier when making your decision. Hearing other people's thoughts and opinions can effect the whole way you think about the situation. When asking one person, they could totally disagree with you and advise the opposite option you had in mind. Somebody else you ask could agree with the first person, and now you think, ""Well, maybe this is the better decision."" For example, say you want to eat out, but eating at home sounds good too. So, you talk to two friends and they give you reasons on why you should just eat at home. So by getting their advice, you made your decision much easier.

Next, someone could recommend a stronger choice compared to the ones you had. Picture this, your asking a few people for advice on a debate you have and someone mentions a completely different option that was much better than the others. Now, you can choose that option and be better off than if you had picked the other options. This is similar to a time when I was younger, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to play football or basketball. So, I asked my relatives. Some said I should play football, others said I should play basketball, but a few of them said baseball. I had never even thought of that idea, but now, it's my favorite sport!

Last, people are very wise and can share that with you to help make you decision. Some of the people you talk to might have already been in the situation you are in. They can give you information on which paths to take based on their past experiences. Say you wanted to go on vacation, but couldn't decide between the beach or the mountains. You talk to one person who has been to the beach and they tell you why the beach is a good place to go. Then, you talk to a different person and they say why the mountains are a good place to go. Based on what they knew, it was easier to make the better choice.

Finally, when making a decision, asking multiple people helps you make the right pick by making it easier to decide, finding a new, better option, and getting other people's wisdom. So by asking around, you'll be able to make the best choice possible. Next time you have a tough decision to make, ask around and hear what multiple people have to say before making your pick.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F785848AB4EB,"When people are faced with a decision they generally ask for the opinions and advice of multiple people. Seeking multiple opinions on a issue can aid a person in making a better choice as oppose to asking only one person and potentially acting upon bad advice. Asking multiple people's opinions can help someone make a better decision because people can provide wisdom, a fresh outlook on a situation, and can help weed out any potential bad advice.

Talking to more than one person can help a person make a better choice because people can provide them with wisdom. When someone asks multiple people for their opinion or advice there is a chance they could have had an experience with a possibly similar situation in past and therefore would be wiser and potentially able to help. Teachers, parents, and professionals are thought of as wise and have experience with many situations, Therefore, people seeking opinions or advice may often turn to one of them for help. Professionals, like teachers for example, spend years in college studying and training in order to to get their job, as a result people go to them for advice because they are a professional and are regarded as very wise individuals. Scientists frequently appear on news stations like CNN to provide their wisdom and opinions on issues like climate change or disease outbreaks because they are thought of as very wise. In the book ""

World Without Fish

"" there is a comic segment which shows a scientist appearing on a news station to provide his wisdom and opinion on depleting fish population. The news channel shown in the comic strip has the scientist make an appearance on their show because he is thought of as wise and experienced and so they want to hear his professional opinion on what to do about depleting fish populations. Children ask coaches and parents for advice because they were once kids too which means they could have experience with the problems that are being faced and help provide their wisdom and opinions on the issue. People being professionals and having past experiences is just one of the reasons asking multiple people can help someone make a better decision.

Asking for multiple people's opinions and advice can help someone get a new outlook on the situation. There is a common saying that ""Two heads are better than one."" The saying means that two people trying to solve a problem is better than just one person doing it because they can provide a new outlook or help come up with the best solution. People can also give advice as to what choice they would make which can help someone come up with the best choice for the choice at hand. The President of the United States always has a cabinet full of people that he regularly goes to for advice and opinions because they all help provide a fresh outlook on a situation and give advice based upon what they would do if it were them and what they think the best decision is. Throughout history kings and rulers have had councils and committees, or sometimes even royal advisers, dedicated to giving them advice on subjects because they knew that no one man can know everything or always know what to do. Scientists also often consult their fellow scientists to get their input and advice on a situation because they could potentially help provide of a new outlook that may have been previously un-thought of or unseen. Scientists and rulers seek advice from others in order to provide them with a new perspective because they know that it is extremely helpful their decision making. Therefore, if people have been asking multiple people for their opinions for decades then we should not stop now and continue asking multiple people in order to get all best outlooks and opinions on a situation.

Finally asking more than one person for their opinion and advice can help someone weed out and eliminate all of the bad advice that may have been given to them. When someone asks a for advice and the majority agrees on one thing then they know that it is most likely the best option. On popular game shows like ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire"" there is a tool called a lifeline that lets the contestant poll the audience for the answer to a question and almost every single time the majority vote of the audience gets the question right and that can be applied to real life when asking for advice. If the majority wants someone to make one choice then that is probably the better option and those who disagree could possibly be giving them bad advice. If someone were to only ask one person for advice they could potential being receiving bad advice which could be bad if they act on it, On the other hand, if they were to ask multiple different people the chances of acting on the bad advice would be lesser than that of acting upon good advice. There are plenty of examples where asking multiple people helps get rid of bad choices such as during the Cold War. The president of the United States was told by one his top generals to use a nuke instead of the possible de-escalation of the conflict but instead the President asked multiple generals and the decision was overwhelmingly against the use of the weapon which could have caused the destruction of all the countries involved. In that scenario if he would not have gotten advice from more than one person he may have acted upon bad advice. Asking multiple people helps someone come up with a better decision because it can reveal what the majority wants and would do and can get rid of any possible bad opinions.

Asking multiple people's opinions can help make a better decision because other people can provide a fresh outlook on a subject, wisdom, and can help weed out any bad advice given. That is why people seek out the opinions of multiple people in order to make the best decision. For centuries people have been going to multiple people for their advice and opinions and we should not stop that now.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
2F76D50DCF47,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes ask more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because more opinions means more reasons why you should or shouldn't do something. Another reason you should ask multiple people is because if you have more reasons, you can choose which ones you like or dislike. Also, when you make your decision, you can make it with every perspective of the idea.

Let's say two people are having an argument on whether math or english is more important and they ask you to be the tie breaker. You have until tomorrow to make you decision and you decide to ask for other people's opinions. Many people think that math is more important than english. Their reasons are that math is in everything you look at from tables to school to video games. Many think that english s better because you can communicate from large distances or at all without it. Some think that math is more important because you need to at least know simple addition to do a lot of things. Some others believe that english is more important because you need to know english when you grow up. Multiple opinions can help you make a decision of why you should say math is better or why english is better.

Now that you have your reasons, you can start to eliminate what you don't agree with. You decide that you don't need to know math because that is what calculators are for. Then you decide that you don't need english to communicate through a text message. You can just abbreviate and misspellings are corrected by auto-correct. Now that you put in your own opinion, you have less choices. The final choices are that math is in everything and english is necessary when you're an adult. When making a decision, remember that your opinion is what matters most. Most likely when you make your decision, someone is going to ask you why. You need to say why you so, not why someone else thinks so.

Finally, you make your decision. The people who were fighting come up to you to hear your decision. You chose math, You reasoning is that math is everywhere and there is no escaping it. You say the smartest person in the world could be terrible at english and still be the smartest. The best author in the world could be terrible at math, bet then that person would never know what people think of their book because they can't figure out how many people love the book. Your decision is made through multiple perspectives and your reasoning is valid. The argument is over and you may feel proud. Now you know that next time this comes up, you can give your honest opinion.

Advice is important. Advice from multiple people is more important. The advice you get from people can persuade you to do or don't do something.

Having multiple opinions on a situation is better than having one opinion because people can offer different point of views to the situation. some people may have experience in the decision you are trying to decide, and when you are making a hard decision all by yourself it can stress you out but when you ask other people for help and get their opinion it can relieve stress from yourself.

Firstly, People can offer many different point of views on the situation and can provide different opinions about the situation. Many people have very good decision making skills and help from those people can help you evaluate your decision and help you make a final decision.

secondly, asking for advice to somebody who has gone through the same situation will be a very good help, people who can relate about your dilemma will be the best help to someone who is struggling to make a decision on their own.

lastly, when making a hard decision all by yourself it can stress you a lot. research shows that putting a lot of stress on the body when you are trying to make a decision can often make you choose the wrong solution. Asking other people for advice can help you relieve your stress and can help you make the right decision without stressing your body.

Having many opinions on a situation is better than having one opinion, because people can give you a different point of view on the situation than you had before. some people may have experience in the decision you are trying to decide, and when you are making a hard decision all by yourself it can stress you out but when you ask other people for help and get their opinion it can relieve stress from your body. that is why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
786CC75D9EEE,"In life people sometimes talk to multiple people when looking for advice. I believe that for many reasons we generally ask more than one person for advice, one person may be biased, not everyone can give correct advice, and they want someone to give advice that share there believes.

The first reason is that people can be biased. Biased people could be your friend, or a parent, and they don't mean to give really advice that doesn't work, but sometimes they just do. A counselor who isn't in your daily life all the time would be less biased and could be a fabulous second option if the first advice was too biased. It is just a good habit to stay away from biased people when looking for advice because nobody needs advise coming from somebody who may just be confused about what the question was. Or they could also purposely give you bad advice so you have to make sure to check that your advice is not biased so you don't take that advice the wrong way and so something stupid or that's not like you.

Another reason is that not everyone can give correct advice. If you ask someone who fought in world war two about stuff it would probably be the wrong type of advice since they were just in a war and are not in the mindset of our current generation. Someone who is way older than you and fought in a war might not be the choice for advice in these modern days. But a kinder gardener would not be good either, because they are too young and it wouldn't be the right advice because they would be in a younger generation mindset than us. So you sometimes have to talk to multiple people so you don't get advice that doesn't work for you.

The finial reason is that sometimes people need advice from people that share there believes. One example is if a Republican asks a Democratic for advice. Or if someone has a different religion than you and you still ask them for advice. You probably will get some advice that works, but depending on if your topic is more controversial on what you need advice about you can get advice that isn't right for you. So generally you should ask someone who you share believes with. If you just let the person give you advice and you follow that advice you got people might suspect something since it might not be the way you usually act.

In conclusion I believe that people talk to multiple people for advice because, people share different believes, one individual may be biased, and not everyone can give correct advice. During life people generally need advice and when they get advice they usually don't just ask one person for the advice they need.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
9DF4B2596DF0,"Why do people get many opinions for one thing? I believe they get more them one opinion, because it gives them more feeback on the item/thing they are looking to get. More then one opinion is better then just having one opinion. When there is only one opinion you get a little advice or feeback about the thing, but more then one opinion can be the thing you need to hear about that specific item you want.

Let's say you want the new toy that came out but your friends already got it and are showing it off to you. They tell you not to get it because it is to expensive for a little toy. you say thanks for the advise and decide not to get the toy thanks to your friends who said it was a waste of money. so you decide to get the new game that came out with really good reviews. When you get it you think to yourself was this a good purchase? You ask your friends and they yes it was a good purchase and you know you made the right choice.

if your deciding on what food you want to get at a resturaunt and have no idea what to get. Ask your friends or even the waiter about good options for food.

But when they dont recomend the food they are saying this is bad don't get it. so when you go to a resturaunt ask for what they recomend, because it might be a really good choice and you might enjoy it.

When you get advise from friends and family they are just stating there opinion on what your thinking about the opinion does not truely matter but if you listen to their opinion you might do the right thing.

93DC556B7C04,"Many famous people who became famous for their work of whatever expertise they acquired usually didn't ask for just one specific person's idea. They saw many people's criticism to something that they made, and they improved their idea gradually, such as

The Simpsons.

When they first made the main characters, it seemed to be poorly drawn and the voices were weird, but as the episodes went on and on, the characters and voices had smoothed out and improved to what they are today. Having one person to ask for your opinion can sometimes be just the right thing to make your project approved by one person other than you, but sometimes asking other people can give you many more perspectives to look at, giving you an upgraded idea for the one you just had. Multiple opinions from different people is beneficial because it can provide different perspectives, they can help out with problems, and they can compliment you on how great it looks.

Having many peoples' opinions presents you with different people giving their own taste at what they like and don't like with the idea you have. Not everyone has the same idea for the ideal project that you think of. Each person has a different mind set on what they like and don't like, and what could be added or removed. When it comes to ethnicity and people's income, people can say that the idea is too much money, or that some people might not like something about the idea because it upsets their culture or beliefs. This can make you consider whether you can change the idea to make it less cruel to the person's culture or beliefs, or you can also consider dropping the price of the idea you have. The idea can also affect different types of ages, because they can think that the idea is cruel or misunderstood. An example is if you were trying to make a game based on WWII, some older people would not like it because it can portray the wrong idea of what happened. Although old people might not like it, many teenagers or young adults might like the idea of your game, and creating this story line from the old people's perspective might make the teenagers lose interest in the game you made, so it makes you think a lot whether you should agree with the old people, agree with the teenagers, or have a combination of both an older, original WWII story line, and a less original WWII story line.

People can point out problems with your idea, and find a way to correct the it. If there is an error or flaw in your idea, they can point it out so your idea won't contain that flaw anymore. An example is the Apple Company that makes a variety of electronics that people. They don't have just one version of the idea that they made; they have many different types of phones, each coming from different years with different ideas of the ideal iPhone that everyone would like to buy. People give their ideas to the Apple Company, such as having a phone with no home button, having a bigger-sized phone, or even having a brand new product, like AirPods. Many people who ask one person think it can be embarrassing to ask someone if there is anything wrong just to find out there is something wrong, although it doesn't matter if you get embarrassed or not. It matters that you got the mistake from someone and corrected that mistake for the better of the people. In fact, having more problems is better than having none, because that just means you just have some more to work on, and if the first type of your idea doesn't work out, you can always try again and again with your idea until it has reached the best outcome it can possibly receive.

You can get many compliments on your idea, producing a good feeling that your idea is great. The more compliments you receive, the more people who say they like the idea. Many famous writers used other people's thoughts to see whether or not their book is good, and they ask for their opinion. An example from me is my favorite series of books:

Gone Series.

On the front cover of the book, it has one quote from an author, and on the back there were many other quotes from other companies. Adding to the quotes, on the top of the book said

#1 New York best Selling Book , basically saying to new readers that this series is good and popular. That is usually why on the front cover or back cover of a book contains a quote from different people or companies showing their good opinion about this book, so the readers can see that since this person liked the book, then it must be a good book to read. Having an award on your book also brings in popularity because winning something like the Pulitzer prize can bring a ton of attention to your book. It can give you more to believe in that your project will be good because you have many people who say your project is good. Not just the people who say that it's just ""good"", but also the people who point out the things that they especially liked within your idea, such as, ""I liked how you included this part to make that huge problem go away."" These kinds of compliments makes you feel even better inside, and it tells you that you can take your mind off that one part of the idea and imagine more possible problems.

It doesn't matter if you have a mistake or two in your idea that was pointed out by someone. What matters most is that you asked people for their opinion, and having the best idea you can have. When you ask people for their opinion, it gives you inspiration, courage, and perseverance to keep on doing your best, because in the end, it can turn out to be the best thing you ever did, maybe receiving a ton of money, winning awards for your accomplishments, or meeting other famous people who also like and use your idea on a daily basis. If your idea just doesn't work out in the end, you could either ask more people for their opinion on how to revive your idea, or it can be your end to the project and give up on the idea. Either way, it can at least be the most fun you've had working on an idea in your life.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0

Well here's why they are doing it if you were to get in the middle of something and you had to pick from two things and you didn't know what choice to make you would ask some friends what they think would be a good choice to pick if it was one person they might not know which one would be a good choice to pick but with more people they can help you pick a good choice and they could give you different opinions on why it would be a good choice and it could also change your opinion on which one you choose because you could think about what choice you make and choose if it's what you was wanting to pick or not.

It's always a good thing to make good decisions and to take good advice, it's okay if you ask other people for advice because you can explain to them what's going on and they can help you understand that you should make a good choice instead of making a bad choice so nobody get's hurt or get's in trouble if you make a good choice it is the right thing to do so you don't get hurt or get in trouble and so the other person doesn't get hurt or in trouble and yall both are safe.

F08529DC8ACE,"Have you ever wondered why someone asks you for advice and then goes and asks more people? They ask multiple people because they want to know what more then one person thinks. Asking more then one person can better or worsen your decision. Someone people could give you bad advice because they want to see you fail or take something of yours and some could give you good advice because they want to see you succeed. I think it is better to ask multiple people and decide whos advice to take.

If multiple people tell me to do one thing I would think thats the better option and I would choose that. Everyone is different some people may not ask multiple people and make the right or wrong decision. For example the other day my father called me. Keep in mind my parents are divorced. He called and asked if he should put in for a position in Colombia with the U.S government. My father had asked multiple people me being one of those people. Some of the people said not to put in and some said to put in. I told him to put in and so did most of the people he had asked so he put in. Asking more then just one person for advice can great fully influence there decision.

What you are to the person also influences there decision. For example if a girl asks her mom for advice she is going to most likely take her moms advice opposed to her friends advice. Many thing can influence a decision but when it comes down to the matter of the fact you have to make the decision its all up to you. You can take the advice if you think its good advice or you can leave it. It all comes down to you. You should also know who to ask. Some people have better judgment then others.

4FF7C90E8071,"Its always good to ask more than one person for advice,but have you ever thought of why? Asking advice from many people is a good thing,and has many reasons why. People should talk to more than one person because it helps the person gain new ideas,grasp more information,and attain more knowledge.

Asking multiple people for advice makes it easier for you to make a good choice. Gaining ideas from people helps you come up with even better ideas to make better choices. It is pretty clear that when you seek advice from only one person they will most likely give you only one advice which would not really help you as much. Getting a general idea from more than one of your peers helps you make a better choice. You always want to have at least a general idea on what choice is better,and by asking your peers it makes it a lot more easier. Advice from many others assist you in learning how to make better choices for yourself. Choice making is really based off of opinions,and asking multiple people makes it easier for you to make those choices.

Secondly,asking many people helps you grasp more information from each person. Gaining more information from others helps you in making better decisions. When you gain more information,you always would go and make the better decision. if you are able to gain more opinions,then you are more than likely convinced to make a good choice. Attaining information from more than one person puts less stress on you to make the good decision. No one would want stress on them to make a decision, so if you ask multiple people then it will put less stress on you. Asking many people for advice helps you understand how to know the difference between good and bad decisions.

Lastly, it helps you gain knowledge that will help you in the future when making decisions. Gaining more knowledge helps you make good decisions. When you have a lot of knowledge you know what is good and what is bad. It also helps you by knowing how to attain opinions. If you know how to gain opinions then you will know how to make good choices. Another reason is because you are able to understand the opinion that is being given. Understanding the opinion is very important or else how would you know what they are trying to tell you. Asking many people for advice helps you gain your knowledge of understanding

In short, yes it does matter how many people you ask for advice. In fact, the more the better advice you get. Asking more than one person for advice can get you better version of what you're trying to do. The more people you ask, the better the answer. Asking more than one person for advice can get you a more accurate rating of what you should do. The blue socks or the red socks? Ask around, see which ones your friends and family enjoy more. Sometimes, you can also get another option if you're stuck. Let's say you're working on a project and you don't know what to do. Ask some people as to what you should do, maybe you'll get an amazing idea.

Asking several people for advice can give you a more beneficial response. Let's say you have a massive test, your friend has already taken this test. You ask him, ""Should I study?"" He responds with, ""No, it was easy."" So you just go with his advice and you don't study. You get to the test day and you realize don't know anything about it, you end up failing the test. If you had just asked your other friends for advice as well, you would've known that it was hard and that you needed to study. You shouldn't just ask one person for advice, they can't just be the end-all-be-all decision maker. You should ask several people whether or not you should do something. A person can be invalid, bias, or even wrong, that's why you consult more than one doctor when you have bad news. Maybe the other doctor realizes something the first one didn't. It's also precisely why consulting more than one person for advice can give a better answer.

Asking a variety people for advice can also give a more accurate response of what you should do. Maybe you're indecisive about which gaming console you should get, X box or PlayStation 4? You ask your friends and you decide, they give you the pros and cons and even tell you which one they have. You can get a more accurate response of what you should do. You should always consult a variety of people because maybe they can think of something you can't. Different people think about things in different ways. Just the like X box or PlayStation 4 example, people have their reasons, different people have different reasons. Let's say you have a more important decision, like which medication you should take. You should ask different specialist and pharmacist about which one they think is better. Maybe one has less side effects than the other, you won't know unless you ask. If you ask a variety of people you'll get answers that reflect on the right decision that you should make.

Asking more people can get you different options if you're stuck. Maybe you don't know what you should write on your essay, you're just stuck and you can't think of what to do. Ask your friends and family as to what you should write, maybe they can give you different options of what you can write. Different prompts, different styles of writing, everyone has their own experiences. You haven't done everything which is what makes other people's points valid, maybe they've done something you haven't. You may get stuck but you shouldn't stay stuck if you ask for advice. The power of asking several people is endless, people can come up with amazing ideas, even if you can't. If you're stuck, ask for some advice, maybe someone was in your shoes and they can give you and answer.

It matters that you ask a variety of people for advice because advice can make and idea better, or you could find an amazing idea from advice. You shouldn't rely on one person to give you advice, you should have a group of people. The more people you ask, the better the advice will be. Advice can add on to an idea or it can build an idea. Asking for advice gives you more accurate feedback of what you should do. Maybe you're indecisive and you don't know what to do, ask for some advice to help you along your way. Maybe you can find another solution to the problem you're thinking of, maybe someone has a brilliant idea but they just haven't discovered it. You can be the person who can discover it. You need to ask for advice, you can't get by in life if you don't.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
E58AEB0A47B8,"We all are sometimes going to need advice from people. We aren't always going to make good choices but getting advice will help in the future. Getting advice from other people will help you know how to make better choices.

Also, think about how others opinions are going to help with making a better choice, and how its going to effect on what you choose to do.

Getting advice from other people can help you know how to make better choice. I can relate to think because I ask my parents for advice about things all the time. They tell me how i can make the situation better and how i can prevent it from happening again. An example is if you get in a fight with a sibling, you can walk away and just go straight to your parents instead of hitting them back or whatever they do to you.

Think about how others opinions are going to help you make a better choice.

I can relate to this because when something happens i think about what my parents say and I know that if i use their advice it will make the situation better. An example is you got into an argument about something and you dont want to make the situation worse. So you think about what the person you asked for advice said and use it for the situation you are in.

Also think about how is it going to effect on what you choose to do. If you use their advice you probably wont get into any fights or arguments as much and won""t have to worry about getting into as much or no trouble. I can relate to this because if i get into a fight with my sibling. I think about what my parents would say if i did anything and how much trouble i would get my self into. An example is when someone is talking bad about you. You would think about what would happen if you fight them and what your parent advice was when you told them about it. would you still go after them even if you talked to your parents about it and got their advice.

Will you use their advice or will you just do whatever you think is right? Getting other peoples advice will really help when you are in a situation that you could get into a lot of trouble. Use their advice because it will really help you in the future. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
34A590772E2D,"We have all been in situations were we need advice. Whether it was for school,relationships, or even financially, people always ask more then one person for advice. This is because while asking for advice, seeking for multiple opinions helps you make better decisions. Reasons being their perspective, lifestyle, and experience.

First off, in order to make the best decision when you seek advice. Make sure to have people with different perspectives. Asking people with different perspectives is important since only one or two people will have blind spots in the way they see it. They may be missing a big part of the story with only two people hearing it. That is why it is curtail for their to be many perspectives to hear what you need advice on. Another reason is the different perspectives could be all the advice they may need. Many teenagers get mad when getting yelled at thinking their parents are stupid and do not know what they are talking about. With the different perspectives this grants people to tell the teenagers that their parents love them and the advice they seek is not how to handle their parents, but how they should listen to them. With more perspectives, it also leads to more ways to see a situation. If a teacher yells at her student constantly for no reason, many people may say it may be due to a bias, racism, or even being sexist. When you seek advice the different perspectives grant the student to see that it is not bias, but the teacher is harsher on him because they see more potential in him. This is why when you ask for advice, you need more perspectives.

The second reason you should ask multiple people when seeking advice is the persons lifestyle. When most people buy furniture, the two main factors are appearance and price. When people seek advice on which couch to buy. Most middle to lower class folk would decide on what had the best looks for the most reasonable price. On the other hand, richer cases would not care to much for the price and mainly focus on the looks. This is why when asking for advice, make sure to get it from people that have the same lifestyle. Another reason when seeking advice lifestyle is important is the area you live in. If someone from the north is asking their southern friend if they should buy a Nissan Quest or a pick up truck, the southern friend would obviously say pick up truck. Although for them it makes scene, it would be foolish for you buy that. Thats why when you ask for advice, asking multiple people insures you get people with the same lifestyle. Imagine what would have happened if the northerner would have only asked his southern friend on which car to get. But since he asked many people he got advice from people with the same lifestyles and got him the better car for him. Finally, when seeking advice, make sure to have the same personality or were raised the same as some of the people asked. If someone was at the store and consider buying junk food while on a tight budget, most older children would say to save the money while younger children would please themselves by buying the junk food. An example in school is if a student asked for advice on a class he wants to focus and pay attention in, if he only asked a bad behaved kid, he will tell him to not even care or pay attention. While if he asked his whole class, we would get advice from other students that care too. In order to get the best advice, make sure to ask many people to ensure to get advice from people with the same lifestyle .

The final reason you should ask multiple people when seeking advice is their experience. Although sometimes people feel like they are the only ones stuck and in trouble, many people have been right in the same situation. Many people struggle with money, and asking for advice with an many people with experience is an excellent way to solve that. You need to ask people with experience, not just one close friend. Another example of this is if you were hurt by a friend or partner. Although many people keep to themselves when this happens, asking for advice from many people with experience could help since they were in the same situation at one point. They may also have a safer approach to your issue. For example, if someones girlfriend cheated on them, they might want to egg her home and throw toilet paper in her yard. Well, they decide to ask for advice from many people and someone with experience said not to. They said to relax and think about why she did this instead of acting out in anger. So they decided to settle down and reflect on how they can improve their self character. Finally, experience helps while asking for advice since they usually have a better understanding of your issue. So back to the example of being cheated on, he thought he was worthless and it was his fault. But since he asked for advice from multiple people, based on peoples experience it showed them that she was toxic and used him. The experience reassured him and made for a healthy break up. Getting advice from multiple people and gathering their experience is key to getting the best outcome possible.

When seeking advice, having multiple opinions helps you make better decisions. Reasons include their perspective, lifestyle, and experience. These are the main key factors needed while seeking advice from different people. From now on, when you seek for advice, make sure you ask at least five different people and include different perspectives, same lifestyles, and experience. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
87C7180CD212,"People in a everyday normal life have a question to ask there not unsure about. So they ask people if they agree with what there saying or if they disagree. I do agree that you should ask more then one person for multiple opinions and for a better response. Also some people only ask one person for an answer which is not the best thing to do because one opinion is not as good as multiple opinions. Talking to more people for more opinions on your question gives you a much more diverse answer.

If someone ask people for advice, they would most likely ask more then one person which is a really good idea. Asking multiple people for advice gives you a much more better response and much more opinions which is really good advice. If you ask one person for advice there going to say either yes or no, which is not horrible but if you ask like 10 different people they are all going to give you there opinions on what they think and then from there you guys can narrow it down to the best possible answer. Also asking multiple people allows you to do better choices for yourself. Overall seeking for multiple opinions is a better choice and would give you better advice.

Asking multiple people for advice gives you a better response because you are going to have more then one person asking you what they think you should do. You should always try to search for the best advice you can get because it gives you more ideas. The more and more people you ask the better advice your going to get but you don't want to ask to much people because it could get out of hand. If you ask only one person for advice they could give you good advice that could help you, but it also really depends on the person. But it always so much better to ask multiple people because it helps you out more.

You can also tell the difference between asking one person or multiple people for advice. If you ever wanted really good advice you should ask more then one person. Also seeking multiple opinions could make your life so much easier because it lets you do better choices. Overall you should be asking more then one person because it allows you to do better choices for yourself. Those were all my reasons on why I think asking multiple people for advice is a better choice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
FECF4BCDDE02,"When you seek out someone's opinion, you want to make sure that it is the best option for you. But sometimes other people have different opinions or different perspective from that matter and might make the decision that you're making much more difficult. For example, a friend of yours can give you an opinion, but it can also give you a different perspective from that choice and make you look at it in a different way. However, getting different ideas might help better your decision or make it much easier. Another example, hearing advice from someone that is closer to you or someone that you really trust(can be more than one person)can make you feel more relaxed or make you feel more confident in your decision.

Sometimes making decisions on your own can make you a bit worried or it can make you over think/stress about it. Therefore, asking other people for advice can help you improve that and can make you more comfortable/confident about the decisions you make in the near future. It can also affect how you work with others and build a better relationship. When asking someone for help on a decision that you are having worries about, hearing other people's opinions/advice can affect on how you communicate with that person.

If you feel comfortable talking with someone or communicate with someone that makes you feel confident on the choice that you are making, it can help/make you rely on them a bit more. As in from their perspective, it can make them rely on you and might ask you for advice in the near future. When helping each other on something that both of you are having trouble with, talking to each other will help you guys feel more secure about your decision and can grow and build the way you both communicate with each other and others. Getting different opinions from other people isn't a bad thing, it most likely won't make the choice more harder. It might actually help you on how to make decisions on your own in the future. As some people say, having a great relationship with someone or just having good people around you can really affect you as a person and can help you improve yourself for the better. For example, having good influences around you can help the way you think or communicate with others. Having someone to help you out can affect you and your decisions in many ways, of course it might change some things but it might change for the better.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B74091BD48A1,"Most people like to ask advice when they do not know something or they are confused. A good reason to ask more than one person for advice is that the other person could be bias towards the subject you`re talking about. Some peoples opinions are not great but can definitely help sometimes others peoples way of thinking can change yours. There was one time I asked for advice about school and how can I make it easier one person said just wait until high school where you can drop out that is really bad advice for example. I waited for someone else to ask and I asked my dad he said to just pay attention and try your best which helped me out with a lot because I dont do both and need to be reminded that is a good example of good advice. The reasons why people should ask more than one person for advice the person is educated to the topic, they are a good person that has made bad decisions, and someone that thinks like me.

A good reason to ask someone educated on the topic is that if I was asking I would want someone smart in what im asking about for a good opinion. For good opinions you ask the smartest person. The reason why is that they can help more. If someone can help more it is better for everyone. I will most likely ask the most educated person in the topic im looking into.

If a person makes bad choices they learn form them thats why I think asking people like that for advice is a great idea. Everyone makes a bad choice once or twice but its good to learn form other peoples bad choices to. The people that make bad choices are usually open minded and can tell about learning from there mistakes.

Someone that thinks like me can help me with a lot of things but I would be more biased to them because they think like me. The bad thing is that I could be more likely to listen to the person that thinks like me because I like them more than the other people. It helps to hear something out loud from someone else than in my head. The biggest reason I would like this is because it is hard to find someone that thinks like me and it would be nice also.

The essay talks about asking for advice and opinions. I named three type of people to ask for advice. I said someone smart and educated about the topic, they are a good person and made bad mistakes, and someone that thinks like me. I gave reason about all three in the paragraphs. My favorite paragraph to write was three because it was interesting to write about the topic. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
AB937FE6C5DD,"Have you ever asked someone for advice and their advise didnt help out that much thats why you should ask more than one person for advise. Asking more than one person can help you by,when you need help on choosing what collage to go to when you graduate high school. Sometimes advice given to you from one person might not work out so you can try a different advice given to you by other people,having more than one person to ask for advice is very helpful and can help you with school if you dont know what classes to take or what job you want to apply for.

Seeking for multiple opinions can help you by making good choices,when you need help on choosing what collage to go to when you graduate high school. When you have more people opinions is better they can help you today or very next day you need to listen to what others have to say in that case dont dont make any bad mistakes. When you hear other peoples opinions you might change your mind and see things different now. Things you are not satisfied with you can seek help from one person you trust but if that one person advice doesnt help then you need one other person to give you their opinion.

The next thing you should do is try to hear other people out for example your teachers or other school staff.

You need to listen to your teachers advise or else you will not know what to do if she tells you to pick an honors class is because in her opinion she thinks you have the ability to take honors class. When you are not so sure about taking a honors class then you need to ask your parents and ask for their advice if they think you can be able to take a honors class. It is important to ask if you are not sure of something this way you dont end up doing something bad. sometimes people advice will not work so thats why you have to hear out what others have to say before doing so.

Lastly if you hear out what other people have to say and have alot lot of people to ask for opinions then you can learn more things you didnt know. You can talk with other people about witch job you should apply to or how to apply for a job if its your first time. Hearing other people advice can make you some new frieands to since you sometimes can exchanage ideas or opinions it can make you more social to. When you really want something you work very hard for it and you also need friends or family to accomplish your goal. You will have more success in things you you seek out for opinions from parents or teachers.

In cunclusion i think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because,When you ask more than one person for help on something like choosing a class to take at school they can give you their opinion and then will have alot of ideas that you got from them and will pick the class that is well suited for you,another thing is that you will try to ask other people not just your friends for their opinions like staff at schools or your parents if you should be hanging out with the wrong people it can make you choose not to talk to them anymore. When you have alot of people to ask for advice you can also new things that you didnt know and can help you out.

3E8567275081,"I believe asking more than one person for advice is really important and here is why. When people ask for advice they usually want multiple responses or different point of views to get the best advice. If someone wants to know how to get on a sports team they would ask all of their friends that play sports for advice. Some people also ask for advice when they want to get better grades in school. Asking more than one person for advice is a way better then only asking one.

When people ask for advice they want to here what people think is the best for them at that certain point in time. People dont ask only one person for advice they usually ask more than one. They do that because they want what most people think is better for them. If you only ask one person for advice then that person might not give the best advice. But if you ask more than one person there are so many different point of views that you get different advice and better advice for any problems your having.

If you are trying to play a sport or get on a team then you would probably ask your friends or a coach for advice. Because they have knowledge about that sport and how to get better at it. They would give you advice on how to get on the team. They could give you advice on how to get better endurance or get stronger for that sport. When it comes to sports there are a lot of different people who you can ask and who give different type of advice.

If you're not doing how you want in school and you have bad grades there are so many people you can ask for advice. You can ask the teachers for advice on how to do the things your not too good at. Some teachers might tell you to go to after school tutoring if you need help. Asking your friends that have really good grades for advice is a great idea.

They can teach you the things they do to get good grades. Asking your parents for advice in school is also a good idea because they have already made it through school so they can tell you what they did to pass.

So ask as many people ask you can for advice when you need it. Because you need to know how to do things in school and sports. So asking as many people for advice as you can is really important.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
999664D56FFC,"Have you ever need to get advice from someone? Getting good advice can be hard, but it helps to get multiple responses. One would want to ask multiple people, this is because people have different opinions than each other. An adult will have a different say on the topic than a teenager or kid. Asking a parent would help because they have most likely experienced what one needs advice on. When getting advice it is best to ask more than one person due to different opinions, different ages affecting their response, and different responses because of experience they may have on the topic.

First, people have many different opinions from each other. An example, if one were to ask there friend for some advice, their friends response would not be the same as their parents response. Another example would be asking a person who grew up rich, tips on saving money, and then asking the same question to one who grew up poor, their responses would be completely different. This is one of the biggest reasons to ask more than one person. Asking multiple people is a good way to get good strong advice compared to just asking one person because everyone has their own opinion.

Next, if one were to ask an adult for some advice they would get good advice, then if they asked a kid they wouldn't get as good quality advice as they would asking an adult. This is a very important reason to ask many people. Asking a kid will give you a different response compared to one who is older. Some kids may think its a joke and say something completely different, but other kids may give you the best response to their ability. Asking kids for advice isn't all bad, it depends on age and maturity. Most of the time asking an adult will usually be better than asking a younger person.

Then, asking someone who is experienced on the topic will be better. This person can tell you the advice they got, and then tell you some of there own advice. Asking your parents is good when your a teenager because they where once teenagers too and probably needed the same type of advice. Someone like a grandparent would be good too because they have been alive for a long time and have had many experiences and could give a person great advice.

Asking a lot of people with experience on your topic will give you the best advice you could possibly get.

Lastly, you can see asking more than one person helps get good helpful advice. People like a grandparent or a parent will give you better more reliable advice, but you still have to ask multiple people to get the best you possibly can. Asking people who are experienced, younger, older, or just different than others, will help you get good advice and the advice you gather will be really helpful. Asking people when you need the advice, even just asking two people will be better than just one, one could ask their parents and get better advice than asking a friend. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
AA815FFC2BF6,"Have you ever put on an outfit, or wanted to try a new food? Have you ever asked more than one persons advice on that outfit your wearing and ask if it looks good, or even asked for someones opinion on what new foods you could try? Seeking multiple opinions on a topic can help benefit your decision in the long run and can help protect and keep the world around you safe. Multiple opinions can help better people, because they can keep someone out of trouble, many opinions can boost self esteem, they can also help keep people from hurting the environment.

Asking for multiple opinions can help better your decision making and can help you stay out of trouble. Many people today don't ask for peoples advice when they are about to commit a crime or put someone in serious danger. If criminals today were to ask for peoples opinions on whether or not he or she should rob a bank, the rate of crime would decrease rapidly. If there are arguments at school and someone asks for peoples opinions on if they should get into a fight with another person, those friends would suggest a better alternative to the situation, so that no one gets hurt.

A lot of students today have a hard time boosting their self esteem to a point where they feel good about themselves. Everyday for school student's want to look ""perfect"" so that no one says anything about them. But it's better to get other peoples advice because you don't always need a ""perfect"" outfit everyday for school. If students were to give their advice to fellow students on how they look in the morning, their responses will be so heart lifting that the student seeking those opinions will have so much confidence to help them get through their everyday lives.

Some students after school like to hangout together. They like to go to the park, or the movies, or even just hangout in someones backyard. But sometimes, students can be very harsh to the environment. When students carry around trash with them or cans from drinking some type of beverage, they don't ask other people for their opinions on if they think it's okay for them to just throw it in the grass. Students don't realize that throwing away waste in the grass, and trees and not in the garbage, and recycling cans, can damage our wilderness. It is better for students to ask for many peoples opinions on where to throw away their waste, because in the long run the environment will be around a lot longer for us.

It is better for people to ask for many other opinions on something, because if that one person just thinks for him or herself and does not seek other peoples advice, then his or her decision may affect many people. It is also important to hear other peoples opinions, because the world around us is being affected because of the choices we make as individuals. So seeking further opinions other than your own can help our world and environment stay healthy and last longer.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
CA4E67209D3C,"Why is it important to ask multiple people for advice than just to ask one person. If you ask one person for advice you will probably get the same answer every time. Also you would be able to see how some of the ideas that are wrong. So asking advice from multiple people can help you get a different point of view on things, so you could try new ideas, and so you could see the bad idea.

One reason why seeking help from multiple people is because it would let you see things in different perspectives or point of views. One point of view could be like you should sell drugs. The other point of view is that you should not sell drugs. Then you start asking more people and more people are saying that you should not sell drugs.

Another reason why seeking advice from multiple people is that you could try a new idea. so lets say someone says ""you should go rock wall climbing"". Then another person says ""you should go swim with sharks"". You start asking and you go swim with sharks and then you climbed a rock wall.

Finally, why you should look for advice from multiple people is because it will show you all the negative ideas. One of those ideas could be to go break into a bank. Now this could be your best friend saying this. then you start asking around and people are saying that this is a bad idea. Right then and there the guy realized maybe my friend is not who he is.

All in all these few paragraphs show that looking for advice is a good thing. one reason is that it will show you all the different point of views from people. Another reason is that it will show you new ideas. Finally it will show you the bad ideas. All these show that asking multiple people for advice is a good thing.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
05F9DC51226B,"""Oh my god!"" yelled Generic_Name in frustration. ""What Generic_Name?"" questioned her mother in confusion.""I have no clue what college to go to, this is a big decision and i don't want to mess it up."" Generic_Name responded stressed. ""Go to the college i went to, George Mason. It is totally great, it has 24 hour food places on campus, nice people, and plenty of stores near it. You would love it there."" Replied her mom.""Ugh mom! That wasn't helpful because I have no clue where to go, and those where all bias, and now I don't know what to believe. I need more opinions."" Asking more than one person is a very helpful, and good idea because it will help you receive valid advice, advice that isn't bias, and advice from people who truly want the best and wont sabotage you.

If you ask many people for advice, you will get many different answers. First off, some of the advice a person may receive can be based upon true facts, that the person giving advice has discovered. While on the other hand, others will give you opinionated advice, based upon what they believe, and with no prior knowledge. This can result in you thinking something is true and very good your whole life, just to come to find out it is not. For example, my sister,Generic_Name, is an all-star cheerleader who is very skilled and has tons of knowledge when it comes to cheer leading, but this wasn't the case when she started out. She had no clue what cheer shoes to get, and what the difference from a cheer shoe, and a regular shoe was. She asked our mom, who said just get any shoe, it won't really matter, but Generic_Name waited to find out more information. She went to her first day of practice and asked around, her teammates and coaches knew she was flexible and tiny, so they knew she would be a flyer. Some people recommended shoes meant for tumbling, because they knew it would make it harder for her to fly and that they could replace her, which was totally rude and invalid advice, but most people recommended a shoe from a brand named Infinity. The shoes name was Flyte, a cheer shoe meant for flyers, She got the shoe, and it helped her immensely. This is one example as to why asking many people will help you receive better information. Another time, Generic_Name, my moms friend, was trying to go to a beach for vacation. My mom told her to go to the outer banks, because thats what she would choose. Generic_Name asked around throughout the neighbor hood, and found out that most people like Sandbridge, so thats where she booked her vacation. When she got there it was packed to the brim with people and umbrellas, smelled like smoke, and the sand was contaminated with burnt, gross cigarette buds, and litter. She realized that everyone she asked had not really been to the beach much, and actually went other places. This is another example as to why people should make sure to ask people who you trust, but ask more than one.

Secondly, advice given can be totally untrue, and bias. For example, when Generic_Name, my oldest sister, was trying to find a hotel she asked her one friend, who had visited the area before. Her friend told her you got to an Inn Called Holiday Inn. Generic_Name trusted her friends advice and went to the Holiday Inn. It ended up being terrible. It smelled bad, was moldy, and had no wifi. When Generic_Name got back she asked her friend why she would do that. Her friend said that her dad was the owner of the hotel and that she just wanted her dad to have an extra customer, which was completely bis. Generic_Name never trusted her advice again. This is another reason why you can't always trust everyone.

Sometimes their advice is completely bias. Another time this happened was when Generic_Name, Generic_Names twin, was applying for college. He asked his guidance counselor what college she recommended, she said James Madison. He had no clue where to go and hadn't looked for places with his intended major. He went to

James Madison, and tried to major in IT, ad they didn't have an IT program. He had to switch his major to psychology, and went back to ask why she recommended that school, knowing he was majoring in IT. She said she had no clue if it had IT or not but that she went there. He was really mad at his counselor, and never asked just one person again, knowing it could be a completely bias opinion.

Lastly, asking advice from people who arent trying to beat you in something, or who truly want the best for you is a vary good thing. Generic_Name, my friend, is a dancer, and in dance if you are competing, and a piece of clothing such as a hat, or a big piece of decoration on the out fit falls off, you will lose a lot of points and most likely lose the competition. When she was making her out fit for her Ariel themed dance, she asked her friend, also her top competitor, what to get to make bubble, and what fabric to use. Hey friend recommended a fabric that ripped easily, and a plastic to use for bubbles, which was really heavy, and would shatter it dropped. In Generic_Names dance, her shirt ripped on the shoulder, where the bubble where, in the middle of a twisty jump. The bubbles came crashing down, splattering all over that place after breaking into a bunch of fragments. She was disqualified, and her friend won the competition. Another time, my mom asked her friend how to make brownies, for the baking competition. Our neighbor really wanted to win and gave her a recipe that had lemon extract and baking soda, rather than vanilla extract, and baking powder. My mom ended up coming in last place. This is why it is a good idea to make sure your not asking advice from competitors.

In conclusion it is very important to ask many people, In doing so, you will receive advice from many people, and and there is a better chance of there being someone more educated on the advice sought, non-bias information, and someone with non-sabotaged information. Therefor, the information you receive isn't from just one person, who may not be well educated, who may be bias, and who may not truly want the best in you.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Many people seek several opinions for advice because it helps them piece together the ideas they get and create a better way of going about something. It lets them see multiple ways of doing something while also allowing them to separate the good advice from the bad advice. This is why people get advice from the people they trust. The person seeking advice knows that they will put thought into the advice they give them.

Everyone thinks differently and has their own perspective on everything. This is why many people have very different ideas and opinions. Listening to another person's opinions can open your mind to the different ways of doing something. It can also help some people to grow as a person and be able to take their own advice.

In order to get the most well rounded advice a person must ask a variety of different people. Often times someone will only ask one person for advice, making their point of view limited. They are only getting one opinion, and aren't able to see how other people interpret what they want to know.

Another reason why a person may ask several people for advice is because there are many people who give bad advice. Unfortunately some people don't want to help and only want to focus on themselves. So they give a person poor advice in hopes that the person will stop asking. Then there are some people who are ignorant to the topic.

They don't know enough about the topic to give someone proper advice. Usually these types of people don't have malevolent intentions, they just don't know the right things to say. Asking many people helps to separate the good advice from the bad advice people give. It also can help to find the people in someone's life that care about their well being. Which, in the future, will help them make better decisions on later things, because they will know who gives the best advice.

Lastly, hearing several opinions can narrow down what not to do. If many people say to not do something then the person knows that majority of people agree it will only do them harm. It is the same for the things a person should do. If many people have the same advice then they know that it's the right thing to do. Indecisiveness is prevalent in many people. Having several voices present should enforce the person to make a decision. Someone can also put together all of the advice they get and find the common denominator of the advice. Making the person self assured about following the advice people gave, because so many of their peers thought the same way. You can tweak all of the advice to create a better idea or a stronger piece of advice. Usually your own advice is best for yourself, so adding other people's advice to your own can help you make a greater choice.

In all, asking more people gets someone more advice. It makes a person feel sure of their decisions and more confident about the choice they will make. In the end when they go through with their choice they will get it done more precisely than if they had not gotten advice. However, there are times where finding the right advice is hard but, asking several people can help determine what the most positive decision is. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
9A0E90492CA3,"When most people are stuck, whether it be in a video game or in real life scenarios, they need to ask for advice. Advice is very helpful in guiding someone along their way, or help them make decisions. Most people also ask multiple people for advice. I believe that asking multiple people for advice is good because you get to know the consequences, you know a little bit more and if you get opposing viewpoints, you can use those to think about your decision.

Knowing the consequences of your actions can be a huge advantage, as every action has its consequence. Many people tend to ignore the consequences to their actions and end up in bad predicaments. When you ask for advice, you are also learning about your actions, and how your choices impact your life. Hopefully, knowing the pros and cons can help with choices and problems.

Knowledge is power, and the more you have, the better. Sometimes, when you get advice from just one person, they tend to leave out important details. When we get advice from multiple people, other people might cover the topics that the other did not. Occasionally, that information would be crucial, and could have prevented disasters, so you have to ask multiple people when getting advice.

One part of making choices involve weighing out the pros and cons. If you get advice from two people with opposing viewpoints, you could get more information about the consequences. With that information, you can consider the choice more and make the right decision. Decisions are hard, but asking multiple people can be helpful.

Advice can be more helpful if you take it from more than one person and interpret it right. In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is beneficial, because you get to know the consequences, you know a little bit more about the problem, and if you get opposing viewpoints, you can use those to think about your decision. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
2AFADBF8D316,"If you have ever been in a tough situation you would know getting help is one of the hardest things to do. Many people are scared or afraid to ask for help because they feel that they might be judged or picked on by others. Sometimes people ask for multiple opinions on their problem. The reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it helps you get the best possible answer, it gives you different points of view on the matter, and lastly there are people with more knowledge on the situation than others.

By asking for multiple opinions on a matter it can benefit you because it helps you make the best possible choice you can. The way I believe it benefits you to ask for multiple opinions is for example, if you are asking someone the best way to become better at football, the first person you ask might say go to the weight room three times a week, then the second person you ask might say to eat more healthy food and be a consistent runner, and lastly the third person says to go out on the football field and practice your throwing and catching two times a week. So with all the information you just received you can use it and make the best possible solution by working out three times a week, working on your throwing and catching two times a week and eating healthy and being a consistent runner.

The second way that I believe asking for multiple opinions can help you make the better choice is because you get different points of view on the matter. For example if you ask your friend ""whats the best way to study for a test,"" your first friend may say to study before the test to get all the information in your head right before your about to take it, your second friend may say that he doesnt know the best way to study for a test, your third friend may say to pay attention in class and do every single homework. The way this benefits you is because now that you got three different opinions on your matter you can pick which one that you would like to do.

The third and final way that I believe asking for multiple opinions can help you best make the better choice is because people have more knowledge on different situations than others. For example if you ask your friend whats the best barbershop to go to in Virginia your first friend might have no clue but your second friend that you ask might give you a location to go to because he has more knowledge on the topic then your first friend. Different people have different knowledge on different topics so that way your friends might not always know the solution to your question but others may.

In conclusion if you ask for multiple opinions then you should have the best possible solution for your problem. There are many reasons to ask for multiple opinions when you need help. The reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it helps you get the best possible answer, it gives you different points of view on the matter, and lastly there are people with more knowledge on the situation than others. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
B35B894BDDEF,"have you ever had a hard time trying in think if what you doing if right or not? Did you ever bother to ask someone fore help? Well some people have a really hard time trying think think about if what there doing in right or not. Here are some reason why you should always ask for advise, even tho you might not get the response you want.

First off, one reason you should ask others is because they could give you some better options then what you had in mind. Having someone to talk to about if what your doing sire right or not is fantastic. Those friends could help you from making a terrible choice. Always make sure what you about to do is gonna be the right choice.

Secondly, always make sure you get some more ideas, or some alternative ideas. That one idea of yours, might seem really good but could actually be not very good. Your friends, peers, or anyone around you could of been in the same boat as you but had no one to talk to and could of made a bad choice. Those friends of yours will always want to you to have the best option possible.

The next reason is, having this ""awesome"" idea might make you fee like you have to rush or do it right this second. Why rush yourself when you could always just wait and see if this idea of yours was really that great after all. Just always make sure for when your about to do something, make sure your gonna be ready and always happy with the outcome. Some people choose not to listen to there friends and when that happens they always regret what they have done. And all the friend can do is say i told you so.

lastly, be confident in what your doing. If all your peer agree on what your about to do, you go and do it. Your friends,family, and peers will be with you no matter what. Make sure your always having fun but staying out of trouble. life is too short to worry about what others will say about you. Just never forget to always remember your friends are there if you ever need them.

To conclude, just remember to never be afraid to ask for help. Always be confident in yourself and with what you do.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
7FB5A53C6DD8,"Seeking advice can be hard, but if you want the best advice, you can ask more than one person. Ask your parents or relatives at home for their best advice for you to make you be you. People look for advice to make themselves a better person.

Getting more opinions than just one can be helpful sometimes. People get opinions to help each other. People help one another in school, at home, in public, anywhere, it just depends on their character. If people get advice they can improve their grades in school to help get a better education. People will help you all around the world if you talk to them about what you think you're doing right and wrong.

Seeking multiple opinions about certain things will help you learn better and get taught the best way possible. Certain people don't care about their education in school, so they do other things and get bad grades. Seeking multiple opinions helps people in many different ways. Some people do and some people do like advice. Some people take the advice to heart like we're trying to hurt their feelings or somewhat.

When people give advice, they can give you good and bad advice for you. It all depends on the type of character you are, and what the type of person you're talking to is. People seek multiple opinions or advice to help their skills in life. If you want advice though, I'd suggest talking to a relative. Talking to a relative will most likely give you the best advice for you and yourself, because they're related to you.

Altogether People have different opinions on different ideas. We all help on another to be better in life, to be the better person. As long as you help other people they should give you the help you need.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
66B4C5358537,"Have you ever been in a predicament in which you are conflicted between a problem, and you don't know how to go through with it? Many people have gone through this at least once in their life. It leads them to get different opinions in their mindset to cultivate the correct and moral thing to do. There are multiple advantages to asking several people for advice. One of which includes the fact that you can get several opinions on one topic, which would result to you either changing your mindset or understanding both viewpoints. Another advantage would be that you would be able to strengthen your initial thought. Finally, the last advantage would be that you would be able to learn and gain valuable knowledge for the next time you encounter yourself a similar problem.

The first advantage to asking more than one person for advice, would be that you can receive several opinions on one topic. Many people either share an opinion, or completely disagree with it. Furthermore, when asking other people about the same idea, they have different contentions they would present to help back up their viewpoint on the idea. When they present their reasoning, one would either think about how they present valid points, which might cause the altercation in their mindset, or they could understand the viewpoint of the opposing side, but still agree with their side. I have faced this problem before, as I was extremely conflicted if I should either help my brother understand subtracting and adding fractions or not. At first, I initially thought that I shouldn't help my little brother, because I had my own work to worry about and I had to prioritize that first than anything else. But then, I got a phone call from my mother to help, because it would help him succeed so that he wouldn't do bad on his math test. Both good arguments, but after a couple minutes of pondering, I finally made the conclusion to ultimately help my brother, since my mothers words influenced and change my mindset from not help my brother, to helping my brother. Not only is it helpful for you to get several opinions to create a different viewpoint, but also, it can help you strengthen your argument.

The second advantage of asking more than one person for advice would be that it can help you strengthen your idea. As I have stated before, many people have either the same or different viewpoints on a certain topic. Sometimes, people can agree with another persons viewpoint, which would result in strengthening their current point of view. For example, when I was young, I was extremely curious about the world around me, as I kept asking questions consistently. The only topic that I hated was math. I never gave interest about the topic, until I had my first final in fifth grade. I was mortified, so I begged my mother to help me understand it. We spent all night trying to understand everything that I needed to know so I would be prepared. Finally the test date came and I was ready. As we commenced, there was a question I didn't fully comprehend, though my instinct was to first choose the answer ""A"". Through several minutes of pondering about the question, I finally remembered that my mother specifically told me about the question and how I should watch out for it, which made me get the go-ahead to choose the answer choice ""A"" and start the next one. Not only can you strengthen your idea from asking several people for advice, but you can also gain quite a lot of knowledge.

Finally, the third and last advantage would be that you can gain a large amount of knowledge when you ask several people about advice. No one in the world knows everything. If somebody doesn't understand what something means, they would go ask a couple of people the correct and valid answer so they would fully understand the topic. For example, I didn't understand a topic in math class one day, so I asked my older sister, my dad, and my mom to better my chances of understanding the topic more efficiently. In fact, according to a 2020 study done by Harvard University, an aptitude test given to two types on people, people that question more than one person about a certain topic and people who only question one person. The concluding results from the study are that 100 percent of the people who asked more than one person performed better than the people who usually only question one person. Therefore asking more people for advice on a certain topic is more advisable and will create the better choice.

Talking to multiple people about an idea is always the best route to take, because it can give you insight on more than one opinion, it can strengthen your opinion, and it can result in giving you a great deal of knowledge.              ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
6D8814C66BB4,"Sometimes when you are in a tough spot you seek help from friends. You will ask them ""what to do"" and ""what would you do in this situation"" . When you're doing this you learn more about the situation, you will probably know the aftermath of your decision, and you will have your friends to support you no matter the decision you chose. I always think the best thing to do in any stressful situation is to tell someone and let them help you figure out what to do. Here's multiply reasons why you should always do this.

You will learn more about what is happening in the situation. Most likely when something first happens you won't know what to do. If you ask a friend about what you should do there going to help you unravel the situation you're in. When you do this you will get multiply different views on the situation. Which could be a good or bad thing. It could sometimes make everything more confusing, or make it more easier to understand, but I know one thing is certain you would expand your knowledge about the situation. Expanding your knowledge about the situation is helpful is multiply ways. It will help you pick the better option.

When your talking to your friend about the situation you will also most likely talk about what will happen after you make your descion. It's always good to know whats going to happen after you make your decision. It always helps you to chose the best option and it warns you of the consequences of your option. It's always the best to plan into the future and see whats going to happened. After learning the aftermath you will be prepared and pick the better option.

After you are done making your decision your friends will always support you. Even before you make your decision your friends will help you, and they will support you after you make your decision. Even if you pick the wrong decision your true friends would be there to support you. It's always nice having someone around to help you and support you though a tough time. It will bring your confidence up and help you be more confident about your choice. it's always nice to have someone by your side to help you in your times of need.

As I said it's always best to ask a friend for help. No matter what the situation is you should always ask for help and it doesn't matter who it is you ask just make it someone you trust. That will help you pick the best outcome.

CE8793AE1BE8,"Asking for advice can make you very nervous. Getting one opinion may not be enough. What if you don't agree with what they say? What if they trick you into thinking about something that is irrelevant to the topic. I have always thought it is best to take what you have and ask for more than one opinion. If you really need advice from another aspect.

Let's say there is drama between you and your friend. You're a fourteen year old girl in 8th grade. You have been friends with this girl for seven years. One conflict occurs in your relationship and you want help trying to make up with her even though she is mad at you. So, you ask some of your other friends for their advice. One friend says ""she's just jealous she will come back for your friendship in no time"". Another friend says ""she seems pretty mad I would apologize to her and get her to be friends with you again"". Then that's when you really get stuck on what to do.

Sometimes it is best to get a few opinions. Sometimes two opinions don't work, and mostly won't work if the two are opposing each other. When you ask people for their opinion on advice take in what they say because it could really take affect on you. It also may help you come up with a good solution.

Let's say you asked 6 people on their opinion for the friendship advice. Three say ""she will come back into your friendship"". And three say ""go fetch her before she doesn't like you anymore"". Then what do you do? You could put your own thoughts into the situation, and use the advice you're other friends have told you. If more people say you need to go catch her before she's gone. Take their advice! If more people say she will come back to be your friend. Take their advice! As long as you agree, and are sure about the situation. Always remember you don't have to do what others say. It is just an idea.

Getting more than one viewpoints on the situation can also help you think of your own advice. Learning your own advice also helps you and maybe some others around you who need advice. Getting others opinions can help you get different perspectives . Multiple opinions help you think better and choose the best advice whether it is your own or even for someone else.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
077CBD1D991B,"Don't you have those times when you are having trouble on what to wear for your friend's birthday party, or what to say to that special someone, wouldn't it be helpful to have a second opinion? Deciding on what to do in a situation can sometimes be a really hard task to handle, but lucky for you, the advice of your peers can help you form a good decision. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you see different perspectives, learn more information, and get a general opinion.

One way asking others can benefit you is that you can see situations from other perspectives. People come from all around the world and have their own ideals and cultures which influence their way of thinking. Take a rug for example, some people have a rug as a place to clean your shoes while others use a rug as a place to practice their religion. The value of others will help you see things differently and with more meaning. It is good to understand the culture and customs of others to form good opinions. No two minds think alike, everyone thinks of different ways to do things. These ideas help you understand the different views of others, and they can help you understand why some people do certain things. Some people have experienced events that can completely alter their way of thinking. Talking to someone who has experienced whatever you may be looking for is a wonderful source because you have first hand knowledge and is a far better way of understanding something than just looking at the internet that is too good to be true. By looking through the shoes of others, you can see different opinions based on, cultures and ideals, past experiences, and unique mindsets.

Another way opinions could help is by giving you information that you couldn't have known otherwise. Maybe you are interested in doing something but do not know how it is like. You could talk to someone who has experienced how it is like and they could help you form a educated opinion. The Internet is a good source of information, but is everything that the internet say factually correct? Misinformation is something that could spread very easily and could give people negative or positive opinions on something false. It is always good to talk to someone who is skilled in that area to know exactly what to do. Sometimes something is just too hard to understand and thus, you don't what to do. Never be afraid to ask the people around you for a second opinion especially if your at a store because they are trained to know and to help you. Knowledge is one way others can help you form a opinion with past experiences, being skilled, and stopping misinformation.

Asking for the opinions of others could help you form a general opinion. A general opinion lets you know how everyone feels about what you are talking about. If you go around and ask people if you should wear a green dress and the majority of people say no, it tells you that green is not the color you should wear. By knowing how others view a certain subject, it lets you know what to plan. Knowing what others are most likely going to think, you can use that to help you understand what your next course of action should be. The general opinion of what others think will let you know if something is working. If you begin a project in which people be rewarded with vegetables and over time people start to participate less and less, it lets you know that it is not a good solution. Getting a general opinion will let you know the views of others, if something is working, and how to plan accordingly.

In conclusion, there are many ways the opinions of others can influence you to make healthy decision: past experiences, different backgrounds, ideals, and cultures can all lead you to the right direction. Seeking multiple opinions help people find better choices by seeing the perspectives of others, learning information from others, and getting a general idea of what others think. Never be afraid to ask your friends, family, or the people around you for a second opinion. It could lead you to a very good resolution.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
DC5B8E6C23E6,"""when people ask for advice the usually talk to more than one person""

\reasons why talking to more than one person is good:

you get more opinions you have more options you have more of an opportunity to get it accomplished because the more you talk about it the more stress it releases things that need to be included to get good advice:

full story how it all started even the part that makes you look bad the problem things that you can get advice about:

how to prevent a fight how to do better on a test how to strive to your goals life lessons how to solve a problem with the advice you get:

listen and take the advice step by step don't be nervous be positive stay away from the drama when asking for advice talk to more that one person because it helps make better decisions because all the advice you get will help you because you have more opinions to choose from.

when people ask for advice they usually talk to more than one person because it helps them make better decisions because they get more advice from more people. Everyone has different opinions so when you talk to more than one person it helps out because you have a lot of different opinions. when i ask for advice i like to be able to talk to more than one person because then i have a variety of opinions to choose from. Asking for advice does not always mean that you have to talk to more than one person because everybody has different opinions. some people think that you should not believe other people's opinion ans others believe you should listen to people's opinions.

when you talk to people for advice it helps you release more stress and make good decisions. It can also help you make a better choice because when you talk to someone for advice you look up to them. therefore if they are making good decisions they will inspire you to make good decisions also. when asking for advice don't just ask any random person ask like a family member, or friend, or teacher,counselor,principal at school. be careful who you ask for advice and share your information with because if you do it online then you could think it was your friend but could be a stranger on their account.

If you ever share any information or problems with the wrong person they could spread the rumor around your whole school,social media, and your outside life. only ask for advice and share your problems with people you can trust but be careful because anybody could turn their back on you. when asking for advice you have to be specific with what you need advice about. therefore that means tell all the details and dont leave anything out tell the full story. when getting advice a bout a problem that is going on,to get the best advice you must tell the full story and tell the things that make you look bad too.

Even though that it makes you look bad and shows that you mad bad choices it helps get better advice. When you tell the full story and the bad side that makes you look bad people understand because nobody is perfect everybody makes bad decisions. making bad decision is not always bad if you are doing it to help yourself or someone. but if you make a bad decision like just punch someone in the face then you should be in trouble. some advice you could get for a fight or something that was not your fault is like just walk away and go tell an adult,or just try to push them away but don't harm them,but if you accidentally punch them back but that is not your fault because you were just trying to defend yourself.

after getting advice for a problem try to solve the problem with the advice you got. when trying to resolve the problem after getting advice try to stop the drama not make more. first way to solve a problem,walk up to the person and say sorry. second way you could do it is like,hey can we just end the drama because there is no point of it. then if that does not work just don't talk to that person or anyone who is going to get you in that situation again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
66D29FC8F9AD,"""I stayed up all night listening and asking for advice to fullfill my dreams, while you went out and partied, not caring for yours."" ~ JeonJungkook. Normally getting more advice from people is a good thing because you can choose from multiple points of view. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, you might not like it but it's true.

Advice comes in many different ways, for an example, Jeon Jungkook, a famous korean singer has made it all the way to where he is now with the advice of his seven group members, he was young when he auditioned maybe 15 or 16. He was in a really bad place at the time, failing highschool, going through finance problems, not being able to talk to people well because he was scared or shy, but he listened to his close friends that hes known for years, and he passed highschool, he's making millions, and he's overcome his fear of talking to people due to many fan meet-and-greets. Someone else who followed advice is Min Yoon - Gi he is one of Jung kooks members, Yoongi was going through really hard times, his parents were having finacial problems and they were mistreating him because he wanted to be a music producer. He was kicked out of his parents house at age 16, he went and moved in with his friend Kim Seok jin, who was also a music producer, Yoongi suffered from depression and anxiety, he spent half of his time asking for Seok jin's advice because he was older and had a lot of experience with these kinds of problems. He listened to all the advice he got from his friends, and now he's in a band with all his friends as his members under a big compony called BigHit Entertainment and he's also a solo artist making millions off of songs and albulms, and he gained his families respect for being sucsessful and fullfilling his dreams even with all the things they put him through.

Reciving advice can come differently for each person, some can be good advice, or some could be bad advice. You can tell good advice from bad advice by seeing how the person is saying it, do they look suspicious, are they being positive and happy, are they making eye contact, are they facing you at all times and relly listening to what you need help with, sadly not all advice will be helpful, this can be caused by going to the wrong people for help or interpreting the advice wrongly. Always go to the people you have known for advice, friends, family other close people. Don't just go to a random person that you've only known for a few months because most likely, they know nothing personal about you, they know nothing about what is going on in your life, and when your sad and need advice they might be there for you but not give you good advice. When you're sad you're really vonurable and will most likely listen to anything someone says is good advice, when in reality it's really not. If you go to the wrong people you are giving them a chance to overpower you because they know if they make the advice seem real enough you will believe it and do it just because they told you to. That's not good advice.

lastly, you can always learn new things from getting advice frome different people. Good advice can lead you in many different places, you could be a singer under a big compony making a lot of money, or you could get a good paying job, some good advice can come from music, I know a few lines that halp me get through my darkest days.

-BTS ""you got me, even in your darkest days, I got you, to be the light to shine my path on this dark narrow road."" ""just one day can we forget about all the fights and pains of the world, just one day.""-BTS "" all of those lyrics have uplifted me and made me feel positive about myself, they shaped me into the person I am today, and that's all because they put their life problems and all they advice they have to give into music, so people like me who are going through problems can read it and see that they went through the same things, so they can let us see that it gets better in the end and that we dont need to wait for good to come to us because we are good. If you listen to good advice from good people you most likely will always be in a happy positive mood and feel proud of the person you let that advice shape you into. While if you listened to bad advice and stayed with the wrong friend group it could lead you to spending your life behind bars or doing comunity service. You need to make the right chioces and be with the right people and listen to good advice if you want to make it anywhere in life.

To sum it all up, take the advice form people but pick out the good advice and leave the bad advice out, talk to your elders for advice, they've been through what your going through. think about you're friend group and if they're good for you're future. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
1D5346180BBF,"The day of election for the next Commander in Chief of the United States is rapidly approaching, and voters are prepared to place their votes in a ballot to determine the next president. However, would if this election was altered. This altered election is different, as only the current president may choose who the next Commander in Chief may be, instead of the public. This could arise controversy among the public, as seeking multiple votes on the next president is more beneficial than only having one person determine who it will be. There will also be multiple opinions on who the next president should be, not only one.

Having multiple opinions on any matter is vital to fairness, and giving people a word on how they feel on any certain situation, such as voting. Having multiple opinions is vital in any vote, as a vote could not be held on any matter without having multiple choices when voting. Votes held around the world all have multiple choices for one distinctive reason, everyone has their own opinion. You wouldn't want one person to make one gigantic, and very important decision on behalf of other people, as other people could have different views on the situation or issue. For example, the Chief Executive Officer of Amazon has decided to halt all production of the Amazon Echo smart speaker. However, the workers disagree with his opinion, and they decide hold a vote instead, so everyone can have their say in what they believe is right for their company. After the vote is completed, and the all of the votes are tallied up, all of the workers voted in favor of continuing product of the Amazon Echo smart speaker, instead of halting production as their Chief Executive Officer was first intending to do.

It is not only voting that makes multiple opinions a necessity, multiple opinions is also very useful for receiving advice from people. If you were walking along the old, dirty, and muggy sidewalk of New York City, and you found someones lost purse laying in some saturated mud, you'd ask someone for advice, to determine where you would bring the purse. Let's say you ask one person, ""Where should I bring this purse?"" and they respond with, ""Bring it to the recipient of the purse."" You would take their advice, and try to find the owner of the purse. However, it turns out you could not find the owner of the purse, so you proceed ask another citizen strolling along the sidewalk, ""Where should I bring this purse?"" The citizen responds with, ""Bring it to the lost and found, the employees will take it from there."" You then bring the purse to the lost and found, and the employees take care it. In theory, if you only asked one person for advice, you would be scavenging New York City all day looking for this one lady. Since you asked multiple people for advice, you found a solution to your problem, and brought it to the lost and found building nearby.

Citing your sources is always important when doing a project so you do not get plagiarized for what you wrote, but how do you know the sources you use are telling the truth? Let's say you are writing an essay about why the Dinosaurs became extinct on Earth. It is proven that they were killed by an asteroid, however, you didn't know that at the time, so you looked up, ""How were the dinosaurs killed off?"" After processing your search, the search engine produced many results containing articles, newsletters, and much more about why the dinosaurs when extinct. You clicked the first link you found, and paraphrased what the article said. The article mentioned that the dinosaurs were killed by rhinos that were killing the dinosaurs for food. You continued to write down what the article stated, until you wrote as much as you could. Right before you were about to submit, you had a gut feeling there was more to it, so you looked up four other articles that all stated, ""Dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid."" This situation is an example of researching multiple views and opinions on how the dinosaurs went extinct, and why seeking multiple opinions will benefit you.

Seeking multiple opinions for a better outcome is always the right choice opposed to one opinion. Receiving multiple opinions or views on any matter will positively effect the situation. Multiple opinions are used in all circumstances, such as voting, clarification, and debates. Without sharing advice or giving things a second thought, this world could be a whole lot different than it is now.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
2AE55BEE1B24,"""The more the merrier"" is an iconic quote that nearly everyone has either used or heard in person. Now, this quote could refer to anything; more cats, more dogs, more trumpets, or more frogs. In this case, the quote is referring to the number of people advice is taken from. Sure, one person could give outstanding advice, but diversified perspectives are always helpful. Such perspectives are helpful in many ways, like how receiving multiple perspectives gives you more solutions to a problem, you can avoid possible bias from advice-givers, and multiple pieces of advice could build on each other to build a stronger, more effective solution.

When receiving diversified advice, you get many new solutions to the problem at hand, which is often very beneficial. For example, you're the quarterback of your football team and one of your teammates (a wide receiver) is advising you to launch the ball down the field to them. If you had only listened to this one piece of advice and chucked the ball down the field, the odds of you throwing an interception and having an angry coach would have been very high. The opposite could have been said if you would've taken advice from multiple people to rule out one person's bad advice and gave yourself a higher chance of a more favorable outcome. Another example of this would be if you were getting chased by an alligator. Let's say 3 or 4 of your friends had said to just run as fast as you could and hope for the best when you were discussing this a few weeks ago, and a few adults, including your parents, told you to run in a zig-zag pattern because alligators are much less agile on land than in the water. You started off by following the advice of your friends, but quickly notice that the alligator is gaining on you, so you desperately switch to plan ""b"" and begin to run in zig-zags. The alligator gives up and returns to the lake. Had you limited yourself to one perspective, you would've ended up as a headline on CNN, but since you had multiple perspectives in the back of your mind, you were able to fall back on that previously stated ""plan b"" and make it out with your life.

When receiving advice from someone, you may also be receiving bias towards something that affects them personally, which can be ruled out by receiving multiple perspectives. Additionally, one person may feel a strong way for or against the topic that you're wanting advice on, so having multiple perspectives on a topic will rule out that first person's biased advise, whether it was intentional or not. For example, you might be thinking about playing football (American Football) in high school, but one person begins to change your mind because they start giving you a whole bunch of one-sided, exaggerated stories about injuries caused by football, simply because they don't like the sport. Although you agree that the sport can be dangerous, you decide to get some different views on it. You go and talk to the head coach of the team, and he tells you that these injuries can be easily avoided with proper technique, mature decisions, rather than recklessness. You go to your parents as one final source of advice, knowing that they'll be neutral and unbiased. Upon receiving all of this advice, you can then make a well-informed decision on what and what not to do because you can detect the bias in the advice, now that it would act as an outlier in a larger collection.

Multiple different perspectives on an issue or problem can be combined to build a stronger, more effective and efficient solution. This is not to say that all individual solutions are completely ineffective and useless on their own, but rather to say that when they do come up short on their own, they can be combined to generate a better, more effective solution. Take the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s as an example. There were many influential activists such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and John Lewis that provided efficient, nonviolent solutions to try and end the racist descrimination that had held them down for so many centuries. These ideas were combined and formed the Civil Rights Movement that, after 14 years, resulted in success. Another example of such combination would be the millions of people working against global warming. Many people and organizations are starting to bring their ideas and perspectives together to combat what is turning out to be, arguably, one of the most important issues that humanity has ever faced. No matter how good the solution is, no one solution could solve a problem of such a magnitude.

Rather, a large chain of solutions cooperating with each other would be needed. This is because the reason the issue has grown to such a large size is because it is made up of many smaller issues.

Diversity in perspective is greatly important because it gives you multiple solutions to a problem, eliminates the bias of a few people, and can be combined to former a stronger, more effective solution. If one was to only take one proposed solution, they may be left stranded if that solution doesn't work with no secondary option to fall back upon. Furthermore, there are often biased advice-givers who can mislead someone looking for genuine advice. Getting a larger amount of perspectives will push that outlying bias to the surface and allow you to avoid it. On the other hand, some strategies may not be effective enough or simply ineffective on their own, but can form a better solution when combined with each other. All in all, advice is always more useful in a greater collection size, rather than coming from just one source that may or may not be biased.

15B1386353B7,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, and they do that because you can see different view points, it will help you decide on a better choice, and if you only talk to one person they may not give you good advice.

Seeing different points of you view is very important when it comes down to choices, and that could be choices that might change your life. What i mean by different points of views is different ways of seeing things, because one person might only think one way about a choice. Asking multiple people really help you see things in ways you might not have thought about. If you only ever asked one person what they thought about a situation you might only ever think one way because you aren't expanding the thought process if you only look at it in one way.

Another reason why you should ask multiple people for advice is the fact that then you can make your decision based off of the advice you received.

When asking multiple people for some advice (whoever you do ask) they might tell you things that are good, but they might also tell you things that can be bad. Thats why asking more than just one person can be beneficial.

There are always two outcomes of a decision, and most of the times it comes down to being between a good and a bad outcome. So make sure that you think hard when you make your decision, and pay attention to what advice the people give you and some of the things they say to you, because making a good choice can be pretty especially with things like pure pressure. Make sure you ask more than one person, because it can be the deciding outcome of a good or bad choice.

My last reason that you should talk to multiple people is that if you do only talk to one person they might be a bad influence on you, or they might only give you one way of thinking.

My point is that you should try asking a different amount of people you trust and that you know give good advice. Try asking more adults or people older because 9/10 they will give you better knowledge and advice of a situation, and thats because they have lived longer and they are most likely wiser than other kids your age. Ask close family members, and the people who know you the best, but also make sure that they are being mindful at the same time.

In conclusion making the right choice can be difficult, but if you remember to ask the people you trust, look at the decision and see it in different perspectives, and make sure to make a good choice then deciding on a decision or choice won't be all that hard.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
899C33966AE0,"Different Forms of Advice

Sometimes I ask different people for advice such as my friends, my family, and my teachers but that does not mean I am trying to be rude it just mean that I am getting different responses. When people ask for advice and they multiple people they are just trying to seek different opinions than what you gave them. They are trying to find a clearer answer, a different response, and a more reasonable response. People are trying to reevaluate their opinions that they have heard fro possibly better opinions. Sometimes people like to seek different responses because they could have not liked the previous response or they just want to hear a different persons advice. Another reason for seek different advice is because they want to make sure that they are making the right decisions.

Reasons to ask for different advice from different people is because they want to find a clearer form of advice they understand. A reason for this is because they would like to make sure they do not make the same mistake so when they seek others advice if they do not understand it they are going to keep asking until they find clearer answers. Another reason for trying to find a clearer answer is because they probably did not hear them so how are you going to go by their advice if you could not understand them

Also you could ask them to repeat what they said but sometimes people do not like to be bothered so you could just ask a different person and get their advice. Last reason you could ask for a second opinion for a clearer reasoning is when you are asking people sometimes the person you are asking does not want to be talked to because he is having a bad day or something, so you have to move on to another person until you find someone that actually likes company and would not mind giving you advice.

Secondly reasons for wanting to ask another peer is because they would like to hear something different and something that they have already heard. They could want some different advice because they could have already heard somebody say what you have said but they want some more advice so they have different things to look forward to. Another reason is because they would like to have different forms of advice because the could have wanted a specific form of advice but they ended up hearing other reasons and opinions on what they should do and you have more forms of advice to think about. Other reasons for wanting to hear different advice is because they want to listen and hear what other people have to say that is different but about the same topic. My last reason is because they normally hear advice just to hear it from one person but when you ask multiple people you hear multiple types of reasons on why you should or why you should not.

Lastly people ask different people for advice on the same topic because they are trying to find a more reasonable opinion on why they should or why they should not. The reason for wanting to get a more reasonable opinion is because if you hear something that you know is impossible you want hear something that sounds a little more manageable or at least a little easier and doesn not take that long to do. My second reason for getting a more reasonable response is because you could want to do something a little easier to do or not as hard so you go for the easier ones so you can get them done faster. My third reason for want a reasonable response is because you could have wanted to do something or hear something that sounds really reasonable to you so you would like to hear it from somebody so you go and ask to see if anybody think it is as reasonable as you do.

When people ask for advice and they multiple people they are just trying to seek different opinions than what you gave them. They are trying to find a clearer answer, a different response, and a more reasonable response. and the reasons for my reasons are in the text so read if you want to understand why.

7CED441887D8,"In life people will have problems that they will need advice on how to deal with them. If they only have one choice on dealing with something, then it would not be as fair as if they had multiple choices. The more choices a person has on one problem, the better life and the outcome will be for that person weather it is about life, a relationship, or maybe a friend.

when you are in a relationship, you need to always have a group of friends that you can go to and talk about your problems with your partner. For a example, lets say your partner lies to you about something that is not really important but important at the same time. You go talk to a friend about it and they tell you to go retaliate and you end up losing your partner forever over something that was not worth losing them. If you go to a group of friends and they all give you different ways of dealing with it then you can think about which one is better for everyone. Having choices make everything easier in life.

Another example would be school, think about your grades, group of friends that you hang out with, and about yourself. Lets say you have a big test coming up this week but you wanna play the game with your buddies so you ask your group of friends who do not get good grades what you should do and they say to forget about the test and go play with them. then you ask your grandma or grandpa who have already been through all of that and they tell you to go study. Now you have choices you can either go play the game and take that chance on getting a bad grade or study for the test and possibly get a great grade.

Finally about this thing we call life. Lets say this is your first year in high school and you feel like everything is ripping you apart, so you talk to your older family members and they all give you different responses. You now have been given choices, you can choose to keep trying to be the coolest and most popular kid in the school or be the smartest in the school and start focusing on keeping your grades up and go somewhere in life.

People will always need choices in life or more people will end up ruining their lives because they feel like they do not have a choice. When people have choices they think of the outcome of each choice and that helps them pick which one is right. this is why the more choices you have the better your life will turn out.  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

If you are seeking to get advice from someone going to just one person is not the right choice. There is a chance that they don't have a clue what they are talking about and might just be trying to make you feel better. Getting advice from various people can improve the quality of the advice by a fair amount. Having more knowledge of the topic or idea that you have been thinking of but can't decide, or an event is coming up soon and you need to plan for it. Are all reasons why asking more people for advice and improve the advice quality by a fair amount.

Asking more people for advice than just one can give you lots of great idea and expand your knowledge. More ideas can be very beneficial. One person isn't going to give you all the idea you need to process it. Asking lots of different people will improve your mindset by a lot. One person won't have many ideas, but i you ask a lot more people than you will learn a lot more on the topic and get a lot better advice. If your not sure on what ideas are good then you can keep asking people for more advice because you might notice a pattern and relationship between ideas.

Creating a non-bias point of view can be beneficial in many ways. It will help you make a smarter and better choice based on your ideas. It will also create difference in the ideas and make you really contemplate your standing. Being non-bias means to be open to new ideas and your not favoring one side or one idea. You can make a better choice off of the people that tell you lots of new ideas that you have to be open to. You can't just sit on one point of view and leave it, You have to decide whether or not you want to expand you ideas and mindset to the next level.

D8728E6AF814,"When you are asking someone about what you should do in a certain situation, you value their opinions and statements but are they the only person you should be asking? Talking and asking for advice from multiple sources is always the way to go when you need help. Just think, using one persons experience is nothing compared to a range of different experiences, backgrounds, thoughts, ideas, etc. If you ask multiple people for advice you would get tons of point of views you have never seen or even thought of, it'll help you think clearly and put things into perspective just a little more and youll be able to point things out that youve just glanced over.

Asking different people advice on a certain subject will provide you will an immense amount of stuff you didnt talk about and or stuff you didnt even think about. Bringing in different point of views into a two or more person situation will help you decide on whats the best choice to make. Talking to other people will also allow an opportunity for the other person to give you important key facts to your situation. They might bring up past experiences they have had or that their friend has had in the past, they might even be in the same position as you are right now. In the end no matter how hard or difficult your situation is its always better to get extra help and advice along the way.

When you involve other people in a situation so you can get help with something its important that you spare no detail, mainly so you can get the right advice for your situation exactly. Talking to other people and including every little thing will help the other person point out things that you might not have seen or even realized were included. Having other people around and helping you getting through this will put things into perspective and guide you more along the way. Keeping your mind clear of any false and stray details will help as long as you have a group of people always having your back.

Thinking clearly and thoughtfully of your situation will lead to you fixing your problems in no time. Keeping people around you to support and help you see things through will ultimately benefit your situation entirely. Weather you are having problems with a friend, school, home or whatever the case may be thinking things through with a calm breath and some time to yourself for you can just process how you are feeling will benefit you in the end. Having a healthy and great group of friends will offer you the best advice of how to fix anything you are going through.

In conclusion, having multiple people to talk to when you are stuck is a great way to open up different points of views, help you point things out and not to mention help you think clearly about your situation. Only having one person to talk to is great and all but at the end of the day you want more people to talk and ask for advice by so you can fix whatever is bothering you and move on with your life.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

When you go ask a person for advice your slowly taking weight of your shoulders. Even if dont think you are. Taking weight of your shoulder's is just a metaphor we use in the English vocabulary (your not actually taking a weights off your shoulder).

Not only are you taking weight of your shoulder but you're also reliving stress. You also stop getting worried about the problem.

Another important thing about asking people for advice is ask those you trust.

What i mean by

""ask the people you trust

''. Is because if you ask a class mate they could give you really bad advice. Or worse they can expose your secrete to the whole class. That's why you should always ask a person you trust the most and someone you can relay on. Also make sure you can ask a pretty serious person you don't want to ask your class clown.

Asking people for advice when your having a problem is a easy way to try and solve that problem. Here's the thing your problem could be solved in a way much easier way if you ask a person for advice. Not only will it help you and your problem but your mental health as well. What i mean by mental help is your anxiety could go down a lot not only your anxiety but your stress. It is a very important thing to do when you believe you can't solve the problem. To ask a person or adult you trust and that you think could keep a secrete for advice.

Asking people for advice is a very easy way to solve a problem. But here's the thing not all advice's are smart or problem solving. This also follows to the trusting category from earlier. Trust is the main thing when asking a person for a advice. You trust the person you asked for advice not to tell any other person. Or not to give you a really immature advice. My advice is to ask an adult your really can trust or you can relay on. Chances are that they will give you a good fair amount of advice. You dont have to ask a adult if you don't feel well around that adult/person.

This is why asking for advice could help you solve your problem in a smart, and safe way. And make sure to ask those you really trust.    ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
1385E7A90736,"When you get stuck on something whether or not it is to buy a cat or buy a dog. You always ask someone their opinion right? If you don't, you really should it can help you make great decisions like, whether or not should you buy that cat or chose that job. Thats why Im here to show you why asking opinions with multiple people is a great thing.

Lets say you want to go on a cruise and you ask your friends and family their opinions about money wise, your friends most likely think its really cool, worth the money you can pay it off right. Your thinking, ""Yeah, this sounds like so much fun and its not that much I will work over time.""

On the other hand your parents are thinking maybe its not so worth it your already in college dept that you need to pay off why have another thing. So you think to your self, ""Maybe shes right this would be fun but I just really cant pay for it right now."" This is why it is so important to ask multiple people opinions because they may be bias to the subject or don't want the best for you.

Lets say you want to buy a dog, your first dog. You dont know much about taking care of dogs so you ask a few people their opinion on your choice, your family loves the choice even though they never had a dog. So you go to ask your friends they say, ""Yeah! You totally should do that, it would be so cute."" Now you go ask a experienced co-worker he says, "" Your dog can be one of the best things that happened in your life but you have to find the right moment, because if you work to much and cant take care of it its not worth it to you and your dog. Also it is a lot of money and time, you have to pay almost 100 dollars a month just to feed it on top of your time, taking it on walks in the morning, middle of the day, and at night. It just not might be fit for you right now."" So you take that into you pile of opinions, sure its fun and cute but maybe your not ready for it, its not fair to the dog. This is also another reason why you should ask multiple people their opinions. Because somepeople may say something to you you never thought of before.

So you want to either go to the army or the navy and you need help with choosing, you love the land and the sea so thats not a problem. You go to ask your family they might be full ride or not they love you so they dont want you making a decision that could maybe cause you your life. Now, you ask your friends about it they say army because its cooler and you get to shoot guns. You realize they wern't much help so you ask a army man and a navy man, they tell you all the things you have to go through in training and in the real world, you think about all the posiblites and dangers for going into it you havent thought about when you asked your friends.

C1442695A931,"I think asking multiple people for advice is a good thing. Because if you are really stuck on something you are are going throught and really need help. Or you just simply need some advice asking people is good. You can different people for help and they most likely have different opinions than you but thats okay. And based on their opinions those opinions can help you on your next decision. But if you need help for anything always ask to talk to someone you trust and an adult. Because if you stay quiet it'll end up hurting you more.

Asking for help is always a great thing to do. Because it can help you relief stress. And also talking to someone can help you feel better with what you are going though. It can also help you with your next decision that you are stuck on. It can always calm you down and you won't have to worry about it as much and you'll also be more relaxed because you talked to someone about it.

Also if you are afraid to talk to somone it's normal for someone to be afraid. But never hold it in for too long because it hurt you more each and every day. And thats not a good thing because you'll not be as happy as before you'll be more stressed. You would be worried all the time and thats too much for someone to handle with. And it's okay to be uncomfortable to talk to someone but you'll feel much better after to talked to someone about your struggles and your worries.

In conclusion it's always good to let everything out. And to talk to someone about what you are going through because it'll make you happier and a better person. You won't have to deal with the pain. And you'll have more energy and you won't be sad and you'll feel way much better about yourself. At the end of the day always talk to someone never hold it in.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
0507DAFBE89D,"Asking for advice from someone isn't always easy, because most of the time people tend to worry about what a persons response to their situation would be. However, by asking more than one person for their advice, it can be easier to make a decision. Plus, it can help you view and understand multiple points of view, help with specific situations you are in, and it can help you in the future, after seeing how the advice works the first time. When people ask for advice, I have noticed that it can be awkward, or even embarrassing. Some people may have specific people they go to for advice, such as a parent, sibling, close friend, teacher, and many more. But going to more than one can be even more beneficial. Personally, I think that asking people for advice can help you make a better choice, because the people you ask have most likely been in the same situation as you.

When you ask more than one person for advice, you can understand multiple points of view. Considering others thoughts on a situation is important because it can show you how others handle a situation. Plus, you might change the way you think about things. For example, if you have a friend that is constantly being mean to you, your first thought may be to argue and fight with her. But, if you go to another few people, I'm sure they will most likely tell you that violence isn't the best option, and that you should stay calm and work things out verbally. When you think about and understand others points of view, it can hep you gain knowledge, plus if the advice dosen't work you will know not to use again. Everyone learns from their mistakes, just as well as they can learn from bad or non realistic advice. Even just a few people can change they way you would have handled a problem.

We have all been stuck in a situation where we have no one to ask for help. By asking multiple people for their advice, you may be able to use it in other situations, when you aren't sure what to do. Plus, when you gain advice, you yourself may also be able to help people. From personal experience, I know that I have gained a lot of knowledge from other people telling me a few simple words. I have also been given bad advice for my current situation, but I have found it very helpful later in life. A lot of people don't refer back to old information, because they are so used to constantly gaining more. I think the reason for that is because of work and school, it;s human nature to constantly gain new information. By asking others for advice, you are not only helping yourself, but you are also helping the people that will come to you for advice in the future. Just few words can change the a persons life.

When most people ask for advice, they think about how it could currently help them. Don't get me wrong, that is still extremely smart, it can also help you just as much, if not more in the future. For example, if a kid is in an argument with his mom, he may ask his dad, siblings or friends what to do. After he uses that advice, he may think that he will never need it again. Even though he may never need that advice again, lets say the same thing happens, and he gets into another argument with his mom. Since the first time he used the advice and it worked, why not try it again? When you give people advice in the future, it can bring back memories of when you were younger. A lot of people goon to share that advice with their parents, siblings extended family, friends, future spouses, and even kids. Even though you probably don't realize it, a lot of people actually use past advice in the future, almost as if it is second nature. Now when someone asks you for advice, it is most likely something you heard a while ago, that you are now passing on to other people.

Overall, I personally think that considering, understanding and learning multiple points of view is very important. Personally, when I am stuck in a situation I try to ask more than one person for advice, because like I explained it can be very beneficial. Plus, it is very important to have options, and not be forced into a particular way to handle something. So the next time you need advice, hopefully you'll ask more than one person!",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
0E24F08F16D5,"Everyone wants to have the best advice they can get. If it comes to work, making the right decisions, or even simply what to wear. But sometimes people ask multiple people for the same advice. But others tend to just go with their gut and not ask anybody else. Not asking anybody else isn't the worse idea; but isn't the best idea either. But asking other people may be a good idea because there is a slight chance you could potentially ruin your life with the wrong decision. I think that asking multiple people for advice is the best way because you get different views, you can easily conclude what the best decision is, and you could prevent your self form other people getting angry at you for not making the correct decision

First off you would get different point of views. If you don't ask other people's advice then you could be making the wrong decisions and ruining yours or someone else's day. But if you did ask other people then you would most likely be making the correct decision. But if you don't know what decision to make then asking other would people would definitely be the best idea because then you would have other views on the question you asked the person and would get a good reason to do or not to do at the thing you were asking to do. And also if you ask other people for advice then you could be helping your self for the future .

Secondly, you would easily conclude what the best advice is. If you would ask other people for advice it would really easy to identify what the decisions. All the people said the same answer for the advice then it is clear, the answer they gave you is the best one. But if all of them didn't say the same answer, then just go with the decision most people said was the best. And when you still speculate which one is the best decision then just hear the reasons people tell you Which ever reason is the most reasonable than the other is probably the best decision. And which ever decision reasoning doesn't even make sense is probably not the best decision.

And finally, you could really piss someone off if you don't ask other people for advice. Lets say your going out and meeting up with strangers and you need to talk about something to make them your friends. If you don' t ask others for advice and say the wrong thing; not only are they not going to be your friend, but hey will get extremely mad at you for saying that. But if you do ask others for advice about what to talk about then they might be your friend but they might also not get mad at you for saying the wrong thing. And if you don't ask others for their opinions and they do get them mad, you don't know them they could throw a punch or whack you with something and you could get hurt because you didn't ask others for the best advice.

In conclusion, asking others would be the best choice for seeking advice. You never know what could happen when you dont get the best advice and you don't ask others for the best advice. But not asking others also not the worst idea, but asking others is the better one to choose. You would be improving your life from making the correct decision by asking others for the best decision. Asking others for the best decisions best way then not asking is because you get different views of the question, you can easily conclude what the best decision is, and you could prevent your self form other people getting angry at you for not making the best decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
AFFD150170C8,"Your looking for the perfect car so you ask most of your friends for their opinion, asking a bunch of your friends for their opinion might seem like it would take a long time, but what if i told you that asking for multiple opinions could help you make better choices. Asking for multiple opinions can help you see the different side of the situation. For example when you go to the doctor and they diagnose you with something you might ask for a second opinion from another doctor, which would help you get a better grasp on what the problem is and what you can do to solve it. when your asking your friends what kind of activity you should do together you should ask most of them for their opinions, you would be able to know what most of your friends like to do. Asking for multiple opinions is good because it helps you make better choices, you get to see different sides of the situation, and you would know what the people around you like to do or what their opinions are.

Everyone likes making good choices, especially when youre choosing something important. Asking for peoples opinion on something important can help very much. When youre looking for a college you dont just ask you parents about one college you ask for multiple opinions on multiple colleges, therefor helping you narrow out your options. When your looking for a pet you should ask multiple worker their opinions on different dog so you know which one suits you best. Knowing peoples opinions on things is good for knowing what to do or what to choose.

Seeing different sides of the situation is also important. when school drama breaks out and you dont know what happened you go around asking what there onions are on the drama. By doing this this you are obtaining more knowledge on what happened and what different people think about it. Courts call people to jury duty so the judge can tell if the defendant is guilty or not. Knowing different opinions on a subject can help you decide what your opinion is.

Knowing what people round you like to do can benefit you. youll make more friends and discover new things about different people. For example: you and your family are going on a vacation but you cant decide where to go so you ask your family's opinion and pick a place that everyone likes. If you dont ask any one for their opinion and just do what you like some people will get mad. Asking for peoples opinions can help you make a choice everyone agrees with.

. Opinions are very crutial things sometimes. Asking for others opinion can help with many things. Asking for opinions can help you a better unerstanding of ghe situation. People have been asking for others opinions for a long time. Now that you know the benifits of getting multiple opnions I hope youll ask for them more.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B8A2B64B089F,"Have you ever needed help to make a choice? If so, did you ask for just one persons advice, or multiple people? Hopefully you asked multiple people. You should confer with multiple people when seeking advice because you will get unbiased opinions, they might have more knowledge than you on a subject, and having a variety of opinions will help you to make a choice.

For starters, you should ask multiple people for advice because they will give you unbiased opinions. When making a choice about something, you will be biased towards what you think is the best. When asking one person, they will also be biased towards what they think is the best, but when you have a group of people giving you their opinion, it will not be biased. With these people, you are getting all of their thoughts on a topic, and with all of those thoughts, you can put them together and make an unbiased conclusion.

Also, you should seek advice from multiple people because they might have more knowledge than you on a subject. When trying to make a choice, you might not know something about the topic, and need advice. When seeking that advice, asking multiple people is much more reliable than just asking one person. This is because that one person might not know the topic very well, but in a group of people, there is a greater chance of someone knowing the topic vastly.

Finally, you should seek advice from multiple people because having a variety of opinions will help you to make a choice. When trying to make a decision, instead of only having one persons point of view on it, you will have many. Trying to make a decision is much harder with only one opinion, other than many opinions. With those many ideas, and opinions, you can put them all together to come to a conclusion.

You should confer with multiple people when seeking advice because you will get unbiased opinions, they might have more knowledge than you on a subject, and having a variety of opinions will help you to make a choice. In conclusion, asking just one person for advice is weak. You should go for at least two other people to make the best choice possible.

55B0C90197A0,"Imagine you are looking for some advice and you need someone to talk to you, that's where your friends and family come in. There are lots of people to give you advice in life or school such as your teachers, family, friends, etc. Seeking multiple opinions from different people can help someone make a better choice because they give you facts and more choices for you to choose from.

When the people you care for give you their opinions of advice to choose from, one of those opinions could be the right one. Sometimes life can be difficult and confusing, that is why you have people around you to guide you through the right way. Let's say one day you want to commit a crime and your family finds out, they will give you the right advice and talk you out of it. Every one of your friends will need advice someday, whether it's at school or at your house, and you will be the one to give them good opinions to help them make a better choice. For example, you have a friend who needs a way to study better and she thinks the best way is to cheat, well, you need to talk some sense into her and tell her to get a study buddy or hire a tutor. Cheating is never the answer, there is always a way to help someone make a better choice before they regret doing something that could get them in trouble. When people ask for advice and you give them multiple opinions to help them make a good choice, those opinions also make them better people. However, there are some people in the world who will convince you to do the wrong thing, and you can't let them fool you into making a bad decision, this is why you ask more than one person because there is someone who will tell you the correct thing to do. A good example would be that your friend encourages, convinces, and influences you into stealing a $5,000 car and if you didn't do it, they would never talk to you again, even though you know what you're doing is wrong and illegal. Finally, your best friend tells you not to do it because you know what the consequences will be if you do steal the car, and your opinion made her realize that she is choosing the best choice which is not stealing the car. Your friends and family will always be there to give you great opinions to make better choices.

Everyone you go to for advice will not only give you their opinion, they will give you the facts, as well. The facts are the most important part to making a better choice because opinions are just what people feel you should do, the facts tell you what is gonna happen if you do the wrong thing and what'll happen if you do the right thing. For example, lets say that you want to say mean things to your teacher because she didn't answer your question, but if you do say mean things to her you know that you'll either get in school restriction, suspension, or you'll get expelled, so since you know these facts, you know that it is wrong to say those things and you will not do it. If anyone ever needed advice, you'd have to give them facts, too, not just opinions because letting people know how you feel may not stop how they feel they should handle stuff. Lets say that I really want to buy a new video game but neither of my parents let me, so I steal cash from a wallet that fell on the floor and use it to by myself the video game. Then, my mom sees me steal money from the wallet and tells me what she thinks I should do, but I don't care what she feels, so I buy the video game with the $20 I stole. Since she didn't give me the facts of what would happen, which is going to jail or to court, I bought a video game with stolen money. When you do something that is bad, you always regret it, and look back to the facts your friends/family told you, and wish you had listened to them. Another example would be you needed to make some money, so you're selling a concert ticket you found in your moms purse, which is illegal and you've been warned not to do it again, and you got caught by the police again. The policeman takes you to jail, then your parents bail you out, and after all that, you wish you had listened to the police the first time, and when your mother warned you to stop doing it. This is why facts are super important when it comes to making a better choice because you look back and wish you had made a best choice.

In conclusion, I say that seeking multiple opinions will help someone make a better choice because if you ask a lot of people they will make sure that you make the right decision and it will also make you a better person. Remember, if someone asks you for advice, you have to give them the facts about what'll happen if you make the wrong decision, and lots of ideas on what to do. There is always someone to help you, and like I said before, lead your friends and family down and through the correct path.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Asking someone for their advice can be one of the best tools to help you in tough situations, but getting more than one persons advice is even better.

Not everyone thinks the same way and sometimes seeing the problem through someone else's eyes can give you a different perspective in how to overcome the predicament or they might suggest a different way to approach the problem all together.

Sometimes it can just be refreshing to get someone else's point of view.

As the old saying goes ""The more the merrier.""

The world isn't just black and white there's always many ways you can solve a problem.

That's why the more advice you get the more ways of approaching a problem you'll have.

While when you only ask one person it may seem like it can only be done one certain way.

Asking multiple people for their advice helps people make better choices by giving them a different perspective, gives them a lot of advice to choose from, and it helps give you the best advice for you.

This maybe how you and other people feel when needing something so the solution to our problem is asking for someones advice or there opinion on that topic. Some advice is not always relevant or some people may have forgot to say something they like about a trip so getting many opinions is always good too. When asking for advice people may ask for different opinions because you get a different viewpoint of the situation, different people that you ask may have different opinions of the topic, and some people you ask may not be relevant to the conversation and dont know what they are talking about.

Finding a different view of the situation may help you in the long run. Although someone may not know what they are talking about. You never know if the person you are talking to is making valid comments or just starting a rumor. The person you are talking to may dislike someone that you need advice of so they might start a rumor. Rumors spread really quick so you might believe them. Getting advice from many people might solve your mystery to who is telling the truth.

When getting advice there is always more than one opinion and they are always all different.

Ever been stuck on one thing to do and never can think of a solution? In that case you should just ask multiple people so that you can get the best idea possible.

One thing that asking people for advice can help you on is not being biased. Being biased means that you lean to one side more than the other which is good in some cases but not most of them. Being biased is a big problem that many people have but when you ask many different people for there opinion you learn different sides to things and learn things you never knew. It will even make you more social to people because you asked for there side of things instead of already having a side. It will be making a decision faster and easier.

Seeking multiple opinions can be helpful because you can hear from many different sides. Everyone has an opinion there is no one in the world that does not. So you will wan to be as thoughtful as you could possibly be. So that you can range your mind to many different ideas and mindsets you do not have to agree you just have to listen to it and add it to the list.

838A96E95C09,"Once there was a girl named Generic_Name, who was going to try Chipotle for dinner for the first time, was asking her best friend, Generic_Name, what she should order. ""Oh!"" Generic_Name exclaimed, "" you should get a bowl with white rice and chicken. It will make you feel like you are in heaven!""

"" No, no!"" pouted Generic_Name's other best friend, Generic_Name, ""you have to get barbacoa as your meat and a lot of cheese, it will melt right in your mouth!""

"" Come on don't listen to her, I guarantee that you will love chicken way more than barbacoa!"" shouted Generic_Name.

When Generic_Name got home that evening from school she asked her parents whether they think she should get barbacoa or chicken as her meat.

"" Well I personally think that you should get barbacoa as your meat, it has a wonderful juicy and flavorful taste."" said her mother.

"" Yeah, every time I go there I have always gotten barbacoa, it has this spectacular taste."" her father added.

So when they went to Chipotle that night, Generic_Name ordered a bowl with white rice, barbacoa, and a lot of cheese.

"" Mmmm, this is really good guys, thanks for the advice!"" said Generic_Name happily. Asking for opinions or advice from multiple people is helpful because people have different opinions, some people may have bad advice or opinions, and it may help you change your mind about something.

To start off, asking for opinions or advice from multiple people is helpful because everyone may have different opinions. Not everyone likes the same things and it also maybe nice to hear what other people have to say about things. If you were to go around your school or work and ask people what they think could be better about their working environment, not all of them are going to say the exact same thing. Some people may say that they want bigger and better bathrooms, more food options in the cafeteria, a neater and quieter work space, a longer lunch time, and many more. That is the thing with asking people for their advice and opinions, you never know or expect what they are going to say, but it can also make it harder for you to choose something since so many people gave you advice and they were all different. That is one reason how asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you.

To continue, another reason why asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you is because some people have bad advice and opinions. You may ask the wrong person for their advice, they could be untrustworthy and a bad influence, also some of your friends who you think are your true friends and will give you good advice maybe be the exact opposite. Someone will possibly try to get you in trouble and give you the wrong advice on purpose. For example, there was a boy named Generic_Name, he was an all A student and did fantastic in school. One night, Generic_Name was trying to decide whether he should study for his French or Algebra test first, so he called his friend, Generic_Name. He told Generic_Name to take his advice to not study at all and for him to sneak out late at night and go to a huge party that Generic_Name is having at his house. But then Generic_Name deiced to call Generic_Name to ask for his opinion.

""Oh don't listen to Generic_Name, his brain is about a size of a peanut, he is just trying to get you in trouble, you know he is a bad influence. I personally think you should study French first."" said Generic_Name.

"" Yeah I guess you are right,"" agreed Generic_Name, ""Generic_Name is a bad influence and he should be studying as well.""

If Generic_Name did not call Generic_Name to ask for his advice he would have left home late and gone to Generic_Name's party. That is another reason how asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you.

The last reason asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you is because it may help you change your mind about something, just like Generic_Name when he asked Generic_Name for his opinion. If you were thinking about doing something you weren't really sure of and asked your friends or family members what they thought, they can lend you pretty good advice that could possibly change your mind about doing something you were not completely sure of. For example, you could be thinking about getting a blue sweatshirt and ask your sister what she thinks, ""Oh no don't get the blue, get green instead, it really brings out your eyes."" she says.

That is my final reason how asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you.

In conclusion asking for opinions or advice from multiple people is helpful because people have different opinions, some people may have bad advice or opinions, and it may help you change your mind about something. Not everyone always thinks the same way about things and some people have just have bad advice, if everyone were to ask multiple people for advice, they are more likely to make the right and better decision.      ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

This chain has less and is more heavier, while this one is the exact opposite!"" Generic_Name turns to face his other friend ""Generic_Name you're my last hope,"" he sighs as he shows them off one more time, ""Left or right?"" She turns around to see both of the chains in front of her face. She debates alone and chooses right. ""So right it is?"" He beams a bright smile. ""I think you should go with left. It'll look more prettier on you."" Generic_Name turns as a shade of pink appears on his cheekbone. ""Oh so now you wanna contribute?"" He whines loudly, ""Which one am I gonna choose now?"" Generic_Name grabs his shoulder. ""Why won't you ask an employee then huh?""

Seeking multiple opinions on things can help someone make a better choice because they can view which choice is better out of the ones that were recommended, they're able to cancel out their original plan, and multiple opinions are always used in society.

Seeking multiple opinions on things can view which choice is better. My second niece, Generic_Name, would always ask my siblings and me when it comes to difficult or even the most simple decisions. Mostly when having an odd amount of people voting on which side to choose, it can simply show which side is the best bet. For example, at school events, they can have voting charts that the students can vote on, and have students defend their choice. Another example is how the majority of the population do ask their friends and/or family for their point of view. For instance, it is shown that tons of people still choose the most popular one when it goes to choosing. Such as clothing companies, food companies, and even with technology.

Seeking multiple opinions on things can cancel out the original thought. My friend, Generic_Name, asked our friend group our opinion on a specific artist, and she told us at the end that she was thinking about not listening to them, but now she's going to because of what we told her. Lots of people before they ask for someone's opinion, would always have their own opinion at the back of their head. To add on, it is scientifically proven that people don't ask for others opinions with an opened mind. To be more in depth, many but not all people would choose the negative decision if there is one. Sometimes they would ask their closest friends and family their opinions on rough topics that have to deal with a negative decisions.

Seeking multiple opinions are always used in society. My uncle, Generic_Name, works in the government and is always involved in big decisions such as approving a bill as a law. In public, and even in private settings, they would always seek multiple opinions on topics. For example, there's this one reality television show when the host walks around New York and asks random people on the street their opinions on a specific topic. Another thing, when the government has to make a decision on something drastic, they would make it a private choosing and would let the public know right after they'd be done deciding. Also, in public schools, when they would have to make a decision on a specific topic that affects the school, they would decide in private first, then tell the students the results.

""I would prefer left. It'll go easier on your neck and shoulders. It seems like you wouldn't be used to the weight."" One of the employees said as he was stacking the cups on the shelf. Generic_Name beams his big smile and squeals, ""Ahh thank you so much!"" He gives the employee a huge hug and dashes to the cashier. ""Yeah, no problem. I work here you know.."" Generic_Name sighs and gives the employee a nudge. ""Don't worry, he's always like that."" As the three walk out of the store Generic_Name turns around and gives Generic_Name the unwrapped chain. ""Can you help me put this on?"" He nods and helps him put it on. Once he finished, Generic_Name smiled and thanked them both. ""Thank goodness I had you guys to help me decide. I probably would've been in that store all night if it weren't for you guys.""

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions on specific topics can help someone make a better choice because it can reveal the best choice, cancel or brighten the original choice, and seeking different opinions are always used in society. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
2FA001A3D229,"When asking people for advice, usually asking a close friend or a trusted adult is what first comes to mind. In some cases, More than one person needs to be asked.

When advice is needed asking more than one person can be better than just asking one. In the event that advice is needed, asking two or maybe even three people can be a lot more reassuring. New ideas are brought to the table meaning more options to choose from when the decision needs to be made. As an example, Generic_Name might not know what to do when the school bully tells him to meet him after school on the blacktop to fight. Generic_Name asks his friend what to do and his friend has the same idea as him. Asking two or three people might give new or maybe even better ideas than the one that he thought of. So now Generic_Name is avoiding the fight, and is safe because his other friends told him to tell the principal.

Asking more than one person might also add to your idea. For an example, Generic_Name wants salad but doesn't know what to put on it. He puts the lettuce shredded cheese and ham on it but he knows he's missing something. He asks his friends to see what they say. One friend asks if he has put tomatoes on it, and another asks if he put croutons on it yet. so with these new ideas at hand, he can now add these items to his salad, and has a salad ready for lunch tomorrow.

Making better decisions is another outcome for asking multiple people for advice. As an example, Generic_Name is at the shoe store looking for some new shoes for school. He is trying to get the newest pairs of Jordans' because he wanted to be the first at his school to have them, but they are way too expensive. On the other hand, he could get a much cheaper pair of Air Force Ones but then he would look like everyone else. Generic_Name is really indecisive, so he calls his friend to see what he says. his friend tells him to buy the Jordan but they are too expensive. Generic_Name then asks his dad, and his dad says the Air Force Ones are much more affordable and look good too. Generic_Name not knowing what to do suddenly remembers that basketball season is coming up, and the only pair of basketball shoes are beaten up and dirty. Generic_Name then asks one of the employees that work there is they have any basketball shoes. The employee directs him to the basketball section and Generic_Name sees the basketball shoes hes been wanting, and at an affordable price.

There are times when you need some advice, and a lot of it. Asking more than one person is better in many different ways. Some for making better decisions, and some just to hear the opinions of others and what they think is the best thing to do. Someone once said, ""

two heads are better than one"".",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
7A0493F083E6,"1

When people ask for advice, many times they will talk to more then one person to help their decision. This can be helpful in many ways. Getting different opinions can help you make better decisions because hearing others opinions is always useful, they cause you to think differently which can make thing easier.

2

Whether you agree or disagree with an opinion it can still be useful. Different thoughts can narrow down your choice. Depending on what you think about an opinion, can make you feel stronger or less confident about a choice. Opinions are not wrong, they are just a different way of looking at things. You may disagree, but they are not incorrect so they can still be very useful. Getting more thoughts on a subject is always helpful. It causes you to think about the similarities and differences of your thoughts and can help you improve you decision. It all depends on how you use an opinion and take it in.

3

Getting multiple opinions can cause you to think differently. Getting different thoughts on a subject can make you change what you were originally thinking. Sometimes you like the other person's idea and decide to go with that one instead of what you thought. Hearing an opinion you had not thought of can open up your mind. It adds a new, and possibly better, option. It can help you to see a topic from others points of view. Seeing things from a different perspective can also help you find out how others will be affected. Thinking differently can expand your options and help you make a choice.

4

Many people think getting other thoughts is not helpful. Multiple opinions just make you over think your decision. However that is not true because it helps make your choice a lot easier by finding out what others have to say. Finding out what other people have to say is only helpful if you let it influence your choice. It depends if you take in the advice and use it to your advantage. It's makes it easier because you're not making the decision completely on you own. You have people giving you advice to help you make the best choice. Getting more opinions makes you decision easier by not having to make it all on your own.

Getting different opinions from others can help you make better decisions. No matter how you feel about and opinion it is still useful and can help make your decision less complicated. Thinking differently about a topic can change the whole way you see it. Making better decisions comes easily if you use different opinions then your own.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
2B7E0B85DA41,"Imagine that your best friend wants you to come to their late night birthday party, however your family wants you stay for their weekly movie night, who will you spend time with? Everyone will have to make an extremely tough decision in their life; they might go to a friend, companion, or a family member, to receive advice so he or she can make the correct choice. Asking various people for their opinion will help you choose the best option by learning the pros and cons of each side, identifying accurate information from false statements, and to view the perspective of each side.

First, when making a decision, you have to evaluate the positives and negatives of the choices you have. People tend look at either the brighter or darker aspects of a side and may neglect the other critical aspects of that side resulting in a unpleasant aftermath but if you take the time to review both sides you will have a more pleasant result. One side of the argument may have more positive outcomes than the opposing one, however measuring the amount of pros and cons a side has is not a good idea because even though a side may have more minor flaws the other side may have a single major flaw. Looking at the positives and negatives of a side is crucial for making the right the choice because generally everyone wants a positive or an outcome that is appealing to them, and the flaws help draw a fine line between what is better choice. As a result looking at the positives and negatives of your choices helps you make the right decision.

Second, when asking one person advice they may or may not provide accurate information or they might even fib in front of you so asking multiple students, teachers and friends will help you determine facts from lies. Some people may know information that others may not know, however groups of people may think a like and may give the same response when asking for their opinion and if some answer is constantly reoccurring then it is most likely true. People can be more biased than others so you can cut the parts of their opinion that has a information that is exaggerated by he or she and tie it other people's opinions to get more accurate responses. When scientist do experiments they do multiple trials and compare the results to get precise results; you can asking multiple people and jotting down notes to compare later similar to what scientist do will help you have better pin point evidence. Accurate information is important in making sure you receive proper evidence to making better choice.

Lastly, everyone is different; we all see and have a different perspective, asking multiple people helps anyone interpret the argument in a different way. Humans generally dont think the same, we may view topics, places, and people different, for example your friend may not like hockey, but your dad does like hockey; both sides have reasons why they might like or hate something or might choose one side but not the other. Looking at one side of an argument will only leave holes in your information, however when asking someone for their view point they can help fill in the missing evidence and change the way you might think about about the choices you have. A rock with two sides; the appearance of the front side of the rock is rusty, dirty, and broken down, however on the back side of the rock it is filled with divine, regal, and elegant looking crystals and the stone looks very shiny, clean, and transparent; a person may see the unpleasant side of the rock but they can change their perspective to see a magnificent jewel; people may see think and stick to their opinion however if they change their perspective they can see a whole different side to their choice, and opinion. Asking someone for their opinion helps anyone view all aspects of many other peoples' opinion; to lead he or she into making a better choice.

Communicating with your peers will help you learn the positives and negatives of each side, clarify precise evidence from misleading information, and see the point of view from other people around you. So if you ever have a tough decision to make ask your friends, brothers, and sisters for their opinion. I decided to go to my friends late night birthday party and to bring my family as well.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
7450531F9573,"When asking for advice it is beneficial to ask multiple people. Each person is different and can have different opinions and view points. When you get multiple opinions you get a variety of different answers and ideas that you can use. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision because all people have different backgrounds, different experiences, and can provide new ways to think about something.

The first reason asking for advice from multiple people is important is because all people have different backgrounds. Many people grew up different ways, in different places, and with different people around them. This can impact the way people think about things. According to a study, 90% of people who grew up in poverty know how important getting a job and being able to provide for others is. They know the importance of this because they grew up without it. For example when I was at a beach and I was debating whether or not I should use my money on ice cream or a sand bucket so I went around asking people what I should purchase. I went up to a man who was not from America and asked him what I should get and he said that since he didnt have ice cream in his home country, I should get that. The man didnt have ice cream in his country so his background influenced his decision to tell me what i should get.

A second reason it is important to get advice from multiple people is because all people have experienced different things in their lives. Everyone's experiences are different even if they did the same thing. This can influence what they tell you. A study has shown that people who have had fun doing something are more likely to give positive advice, and those who have not had a good experience are more likely to give negative advice. When someone has had not good experiences with something will probably not recommend you do that same thing where as if someone has had a good time doing something they might recommend it. For example when a friend of mine was preparing to go on vacation to Florida, he was wondering if he should take a plane or drive. Many people he asked said that when they had been on planes they were not pleased with the comfort ability of them and that he should drive. Others said that in their experiences of being on a plane where quite enjoyable and that driving would be very long and boring. Each person has a different experience and has different advice to give you.

The final way seeking multiple opinions is beneficial to making a good decision is that others can provide new ways to think about something. Each person interprets everything you say differently and think about things differently. for example I was wondering if I should start writing an essay now or wait a little bit and brain storm. I asked my mom and dad what I should do and my mom said that I should think and do a little bit of it now, then later go back check it and do a little bit more. I didn't even think of doing that and it goes to show that asking multiple people can provide new ideas and ways of thinking. According to a philosopher if man gets caught up with work and close his mind to other ways of going about it, he will need someone else to open it for him. this explains that different opinions can help one open their mind to different things and make better decisions getting advice from multiple people is beneficial because all people have different backgrounds, different experiences, and have different ways to think about things. Multiple opinions help you make a better choice because you can see what other people think about a certain thing. Getting multiple opinion can also help you a chance to think of something in a way that you didnt think about. If you ever need advice in the future, ask multiple people about it and make your decision from there.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
7DA14E1D6FA0,"How can seeking multiple opinions help someone make a better choice? Throughout our lives we are forced to make decisions and choices everyday. These decisions can range from deciding what to eat for breakfast, all the way to really important ones such as what career path to choose. However, when we make these decisions we do not only make them by ourselves. Instead, we seek advice from other people to help us better understand the decision to be made, that way we know we can make the smarter choice.

The first way seeking advice from other people helps us, is by showing us multiple points of view. Many of these choices that we make can affect other people. For example, making a big decision such as whether or not to go to college affects multiple people. A major decision like this has both pros and cons to the argument. When we talk to other people about a decision like this, they help us understand the benefits to making a certain choice and the negatives. According to a recent study, people are more likely to make smarter choices and decisions when they work in a group. This is because every single individual in that group is given multiple points of view to base their decisions off of. These multiple points of view shed light on to they ways different people view the choice to be made. Then, when every person in that group can then provide even smarter opinions, the entire group makes a choice that benefits everyone. This links back to a single person making smarter decision by basing it off other peoples opinions.

The second way seeking advice from others helps us is by learning new information. When a person is faced with a choice to be made, they may not know all the information about it. However for them to better understand the choice, they seek other opinions such as asking a friend, or searching about it on the internet. When we do this we do not only learn more about the choice, but we better understand the choice that needs to be made. For example, a couple of months ago I was given the choices of what classes I would like to take in high school. I took this decision home to discuss with my parents and we both had opposite views of the classes I should take. I had only wanted to take three honors classes while my parents had wanted me to take four. The following weekend my Aunt, and Uncle came to visit along with my grandparents. All four of these people had gone through advanced schooling and had tons of advice to give on honors classes. Due to my parents and I being able to hear multiple opinions, we were able to make a decision that made my parents and I both happy.

The last way that seeking advice from others helps us is by given us instruction. During times that we need to make a choice, certain people can help us with that. They can provide us with key information on how to go about making that choice. An example of this is a guidance counselor. Guidance counselors can help us layout the decision and help us see the pros and cons of the decision. The counselors also help give us details about the decision because they have experience from helping others in the past. This leads back to instruction and how getting instruction from different people and different opinions will help us successfully make a better choice.

In conclusion seeking multiple opinions to make a better choice helps us by, giving us different points of view, learning new information, and through instruction. Without the opinions of different people, we are not able to understand the real way to make a decision. Therefore, it is important to ask multiple people for advice to help make the smarter decision.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
CCA7A1220DA0,"How Getting and Asking for Multiple Opinions Can Help You Make a Better Decision

Have you ever had to make an important life decision? It can be very difficult, depending on the impact of your decision, to choose right away. As a result, you might ask your peers to give you advice to make the right choice. You may find that you agree with some people and disagree with others. Other times you might have to meet in the middle and find pros and cons about everyone's opinion and then make a decision with that information. Like I said, not easy right? However, if you ask multiple people for advice on your decision, you can gain multiple points of view, you might find it easier to make your decision with other opinions, and you might find a better option through multiple opinions rather than just one.

First and foremost, you can gain multiple points of view. Everyone has a different way of thinking. Your best friends way of thinking is very different than yours. Sometimes you might have the smarter idea, sometimes they will have the smarter idea. I know if I had to make a big, life-changing decision that I would ask all of my closest friends. I can recall one time when I was making a personal decision about a year ago, and I did not know what to do. I asked my closest friends what I should do, and almost all of them responded just about how I expected them to. Most of them said they wanted to see me happy, so they encouraged me to choose the decision that would make me the happiest. Others gave me facts, pros and cons, and why they would be disappointed if I made one decision over the other. They then told me that they believed in me, and I would eventually make the right decision. Having those multiple points of view on what they thought really helped me decide on what I should do. I think if I had not have asked them for advice, I would have made a decision I would have regretted.

Secondly, if you ask for multiple opinions, you might be find it easier to make your decision with opinions other than your own. Sometimes when a decision is very impactful, you can get stressed out over the choice you want to make. Asking others may make deciding easier because all you have to honestly do is listen to their ideas and decide if you agree with them or not. Then, using your common sense and their advice, you can choose the decision you believe is best for you . Also, you actually might know what you are going to choose. But you might still want to ask other people what they think because that can ""confirm"" that you have made the right decision.

Lastly, when you get advice from multiple people, you can find a better option than you originally thought. Let's say you have weighed your options of certain decisions that you think are the right decisions. You chose what you think, in your mind, is best. You then ask your friends for their opinion, and suddenly everyone is saying everything different than what you thought. All of your wonderful thoughts are suddenly crushed with a wrecking ball. After listening to all of their thoughts, you find some are much more brilliant than yours. You then go back and completely rethink your decisions, just because of those few opinions. After extensive thought, you decide that your original idea was bogus. When you first make a decision, even if you had thought about for a long time, the stress of making a decision quick can sometimes fog your thinking. That is why having other people's opinions can help you make the right decision, even if it is the second time trying to choose what is best for you.

All in all, having people help you is very, very important. I believe if I did not have people help me, not even just give me advice, that I would not do my best in school. We as humans need other humans! It's just how it goes. Asking for advice is a pretty normal thing to do. When asking for advice, remember it can only positively effect you by giving you different points of view, help you make a better decision, and you possibly can find a better choice than you originally thought. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
DBCC1F8F92B5,"Talking with more than one person can make decisions have a more clear best choice. Seeking advice from multiple people allows for learning from others' experiences, more inclusive actions, and different perspectives on issues. These all help a person make the best decision, and lead to the most prosperity.

It can be difficult to work through tough decisions on your own, so asking others who have gone through similar circumstances can help cause a better outcome. When I was deciding whether I should apply to Awesome Math Summer Program, a prestigious math overnight camp at Cornell University, I was debating if this would be a worthwhile experience for me. It would have been the first ever time I stayed away from home by myself, and I was nervous I wouldn't make any friends. The camp was also highly priced, and I didn't want to put financial burden on my parents, who were already paying for my brother's expensive private college. However, Awesome Math Summer Program is known for the classes it offers, all of which would greatly benefit me as a competitive math student. Many of the courses there were perfect for my math level, and would provide a challenge I wasn't getting in normal school math. Many of my friends said it was a great experience, but I didn't know if they were providing me the whole truth on what the camp was like. I was very conflicted on what my plan of action should be, so I turned to another person who I knew had past experience and could guide me through my decision making. My brother had already attended Awesome Math Summer Program a few years back, and he said although it wasn't suited for his style of learning, it would be a great fit for me. The lessons were more problem solving based, which was my favorite type of class. His knowledge of the program allowed me to make the best decision regarding my application to Awesome Math Summer Program, which in the end I did apply and get accepted to. My brother's advice from his own personal experiences gave me a look into a camp I wouldn't have had otherwise, and allowed me to have one of the best summers of my life. His and others' advice played a large role in me attending this program, and also have made me more including of others.

One of the biggest flaws I have is that it is extremely difficult for me to focus on what others need over my own needs. It can be hard to know how to include everyone so they benefit from my actions, as well as make sure no one is being left out. However, I find I am more inclusive when I know what multiple individuals need to succeed. In sixth grade, I was student council president of my school, and one of the topics many students wanted me to address was on bullying. I didn't know how exactly I could help students going through this horrible ordeal, because many victims of bullying don't like to stand up for fear of more shame. When I consulted with teachers, students, and my parents, they all had an overarching idea of focusing on kindness and the prevention of bullying, instead of bullying itself. This was something I never thought of before and never would have been able to think of, but with the aid of many others, I was able to form a new idea for approaching bullying in my school. I established a wristband kindness program, where wristbands were given out to students who were seen doing kind acts, such as helping another student without being asked or holding the door open at recess. When those students saw another student doing a thoughtful deed, they would pass on the bracelet and continue the spread of kindness. This motivated many young children to become more generous and understanding, a trait that will take them far in life. This idea wouldn't have even have been possible if it weren't for all the kids and teachers that helped me decide what I should focus on as student council president, as well as giving me the ideas for the project. I was able to develop a more inclusive program from multiple opinions, which also helps provide different viewpoints in conflicts.

The judicial branch has the complicated job of making some of the most difficult decisions in our country. During the Supreme Court case of Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeir, the justices had to decide if school officials could censor the school newspaper, or if this was violation of First Amendment Rights. They worked together to deliberate the most Constitutionally fair outcome, and formed the majority opinion based off of what most justices thought was the best ruling. Each justice was able to provide their own perspective on the issue, which is especially important for court cases since everyone has different ideas on what is fair. In the end, they ruled the First Amendment did not prohibit schools from censoring the school newspaper. They were able to reach this ruling from countless hours spent in debate of the conflict, and make a fair decision based off of everyone's unique perspective. The opinions from multiple individuals help make the most just decision in a court case, as well as help decision making in real life.

Most decisions do not require much in-depth analyzing, but there are some can be very hard and draining to make. No matter how exhausting this can be though, there are always methods to make decision making more bearbale. One way to make this easier is to seek the advice of more than one person, as this can lead to the best choice. Others who have already been through what you are going to can give helpful advice, as well as make more inclusive decisions and give a different view on issues. From this, a person can take the best and most fair actions to help them succeed.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
8DFFA4FB6135,"In our world today, people are always asking for advice. Some people ask their friends if a dress looks good on them, and others ask their parents what they should do for a living. Advice can have a big and little impact on peoples lives depending on what your getting advice for. Unfortunately, not everyone gets accurate advice as people lie to others. Some people lie so they don't hurt others feelings, and some lie to hurt others feelings. Whatever the reason, I believe that people should not give other people unaccurate advice as it can lead someone to make a wrong decision. Advice can be described as an opinion from someone that can cause an influence on someone else. It is important that we get advice from multipe people as it helps us make the right choices. If one of my friends gave me wrong advice, I would have other people to give me the right advice so I do make the right decision. I would ask for advice from multiple people as it would give me diferrent options to choose from and let me know what opinions differrent people have. I would take advice from multiple people so I can see who is lying to me and who is not, and I can get advice from people who may be smarter than others and care more about my problem. I do believe that asking a majority of people rather than one is a wise decision as you're not taking any risks.

Firstly, I would ask multiple people for advice so I could get to know the different opinions people have on what i'm asking. Some people may have different advice for me and I would want to get to know all of it. An example of this could be me asking someone if I should wear a certain dress to homecoming. The person I ask may say that it looks too casual, but then I go up to someone else and they say it looks perfect. I dont know who to choose from, so I go to ask a few more people. The majority of these people said that I should wear the dress to homecoming, but then there was still a few people who said I shouldn't. Since there was more people who said the dress looked good and that I should wear it, that's the advice I would take. This can happen in a many doferrent ways other than asking advice on clothing. It can be advice on what classes you should take in school, what design your room should look like, and even what you should do in your futur. Advice is just an opinion that can influence your decision though it doesn't have to. Imagine you asked advice on what you should do for a career and everyone says a doctor, but in reality you want to be a veteranarian. Would you take everyone elses advice or would you take the path that you want to go on. Personally, I would take the choice of being a veteranarian because even though there are more people who want me to be a doctor, I would choose the path that I believe is right for me. I do agree with the idea that you should take advice from otheres, but if it conflicts with things you want to do, then I do not think you should have to take the advice given.

Secondly, I belive that asking advice from more than one person is smart because you can see who's lying to you and who's not. When people give advice, they may give inaccurate advice to either harm or help you. Either way, lying about advice is not okay and it needs to end. If someone is asking for advice about what classes to take and you give them incorrect advice, they may choose the wrong classes and be miserable that school year. This is where asking other people takes part. Even though one person lied, you can still go to other people and ask advice from them. Doing this is smart because you can choose the right classes and figure out who was lying to you. If you figure out who was lying, then you will know not to ask advice from them anymore. I've learned this the hard way. Although my decision wasn't smart, I learned two new lessons that day. One was to ask more than one person for advice, and the other one was to never ask my good friend for advice again. If you can figure out who is lying to you about advice, than you can learn to not ask them again and go to people who give good, strong, and accurate advice.

Lastly, I would take advice from multiple people rather than one because some people may have better advice than others. Everyone is strong in diferrent things such as sports, music, pageants, and theatre. If I was asking about advice on what musical I should try out for, I would most likely ask diferrent music and thetre teachers rather than a football or soccar coach. The same could go for anything I'd need advice on. If I needed to ask one of my friends for advice on classes, I would probably ask a friend who has taken that class rather than a student who hasn't. Some people may also care more than others about a subject. If I was asking a student who is not stong in science for help with my science homework, they may push it off and ask for me to find someone else, but if i ask a friend who is strong in science, they would probably help me. The same can go for advice. Lets say I needed advice on what to wear, I would ask multiple people who have a good style so that I can get the best possible options. Even though they are strong in that area, I would still ask more than one person because I would want to get the most options I can.

In conclution, I belive that asking multiple people for advice is key to making the right decision. I belive this because asking multiple people can give you different options to choose from and lets you know what opinions people have. It also can show you who may be lying and who cares more than other people might. Some people may also have better advice than others do.

I strongly agree that asking multipe people for advice is very wise as you don't risk making any wrong decisions. Advice is very important in everyones lives, but you have to know how and who to get it from. If you know these things, you will be able to get good advice in your life while knowing you made the right decision. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

A lot of people think in different ways and have certain opinions on certain topics. It cant hurt to get a second opinion on something either. In this essay I will explain the benefits of getting more then one persons opinion on the problem.

After all why do you think toothpaste companies say 9/10 dentist recommended the tooth paste? It's because the more dentists that agree with it make it more credible. Same thing with getting advice. Lets say you ask that one dentist that says the toothpaste is bad , now lets say you only asked him. Then you would think its a bad toothpaste and in reality its a good toothpaste, however you didnt ask any of the other dentist and stopped after one person.

Just the other day a situation came up and I needed to ask people for advice. The dilemma was whether or not I should wear shorts on Saturday. My brother and I wanted to play outside, however i wasnt changed yet so I told him I would go change. Before I went to get changed I asked him if it was warm enough to wear shorts and he said yes. I wasnt sure so I asked my mom, she said no because it was gonna be windy. Just to make sure I asked my dad and he said to wear pants because of the wind. They where right if I would have stopped asking after my brother I would have been cold.

We make hundreds of choices everyday. From whether we should hit that snooze button or wake up. These choices we make will make us into who we are. We need to make sure we are making the best choices we can make. Asking multiple people about a topic will not only bring us closer to that person but also help us make good decisions.

BA30863CDECB,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, because people could have different opinions based on there personalities, The person your trying to ask for advice might not be the smartest and it could cause you to do something you might regret doing in the future, you should always ask someone who's trust worthy that could keep it private.

People could have different opinion's based on there personality. Someone could give you advice that isn't so positive, like a guy who's been to prison multiple time's. You can ask a harsh stood up guy and he might give you the advice ""Stand up for yourself"" because his personality is built like that. If you asked your mom for advice she would give you the most caring and thoughtful advice she could. That's why its always important to ask people with good personality's for advice.

The person your trying to get advice from might not be the wisest. You could ask them for advice and they could give something silly. You ask for advice and the person say's something unusual immature advice. The'y probably don't take you serious and give you wrong advice that possibly lead's you to do something wrong. That's why you should always ask someone smart for advice.

You should always ask a trustworthy friend for advice. You could ask someone for advice that you don't trust as much as you trust your close friend's, and that person you don't trust might give you the wrong advice. Its always important to ask someone you trust for the right advice or you could end up doing something you might have regretted doing.

7B000D776D89,"why should i take your advice when you won't take mine. When people ask for advice some time's it better, they ask more than one person as suppose to one person. my question is why is it better to have more than one advice from other as suppose to one person. My first advice is asking advice from people isn't bad because you can ask the people close to you they. second you can whether or not you want there help because it's your choice. My last advice is that you can ask as many people as you want. when asking for an advice make sure you get both side of the argument,

When asking for an advice from people you want to ask you'r self know it's not bad but as long as you ,can you trust them or not. Be careful making that decision because some people could be jelouse of you. They might have wanted to have the same role in the play that you got. Your stuck on whether to join the play or stay with you family and help them out. they might take advantage of you'r distress ,and offer you advice that could stress you out more. They might say that if you go join the play how will your family feel. How would it feel of they left you think about that .they could also say how will they get by if your not around what will you do ,and start to make you have negative thoughts about your self ,and more they would have put more pressure on they decision your about to make . But as to when you ask some one you trust ,and you know that even if they wanted the same role as you they would give you they best advice. They could tell you that if you go you can make more money and help out more as to if you were here they would spend more money on you because they town doesn't have high paying jobs. they might tell you not to go and say that if you went and didn't make it big and came back home will you be able to help them ,or what if you went to a dangerous place and you got harmed your family would be in more dept because ,they will have to pay for your hospital bills. with there advice you could be able to make you'r decision

My second advice is whether you want there help or not. The reason why am saying this is because if you want there help but you think you can make the decision your self when it can impact you. What i am about to tell you is from my experience, when i was picking my courses for middle school course I was debating whether I should ask my family for help. I decided not to and it cost me because when i was picking my classes i picked all A.A.P's thinking I knew what I could do . on the first day of class the teacher gave us a quiz on pythageron theorem ,and I thought that it was easy ,but i kept answering trying to solve the question i couldn't solve it I was freaked I didn't know what to do so i guessed and turned it in. When I got the test back i got 75% instead of dropping out the class, I kept on staying in the class after a while of failing my family told me to drop out ,but i didn't and i failed the class.

My third advice is ask as many people as you want, as my grand farther used to say ask as may people you need to ask before it final. what am trying to say is that is you are unsure of your self or other's you can ask as many people as you need and figure out what you want to do. When i was in 5th grade, and wanted advice i would ask five people, but i was all ways unsure. So i would ask more people for their views ,and idea's because i asked them i was more sure of what i wanted to do. So what ever you do maybe ask for help many people have different views just make sure when you ask people you know you asked as many people as you want when asking for an advice make sure you get both side of the argument, because just cause you like on side because you have all of your favorite people on it doesn't mean you have to look there way. when asking people for their advice you have to make sure you can reason with them ,and the and see things from their prospective. always look both ways because you can always miss some thing because when i was a 3 grade I would always let my ball roll down hill in our back yard.

one day it rolled onto the road i ran to get it ,and if I hadn't looked left and right I would have die because a car was coming a top speed.

in conclusion what am trying to say is by this is when asking for advice you should talk to more than one person,after all 2 heads are better than one because al am saying is asking advice from people isn't bad because you can ask the people close to you they. you can chose whether or not you want there help because it's your choice. And third is that you can ask as many people as you want. and last you can always have more than one view because you never know when you might need to take this advice to hearth ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EAD0F017B5D4,"Making informed decisions is a key to happiness. An informed decision is a decision that you have thought about, not a decision that you blindly choose, so you don't regret it. Like asking for advise, you might not know who to ask. Well, when people ask for advise, they should ask more than one person because asking multiple people could shed light upon multiple points of view, one person could be biased toward a decision, and you are more likely to ask someone you trust.

Showing multiple points of view means that you get different angles, or ideas of an issue or decision. For example, if you can't decide if you should go to a party or not, and you ask your friend they might say that it will be really fun. Although, if you ask your mom or dad, they might bring up a different point of view, and say that it could be risky or dangerous. Going to that party is probably not a good idea, but if you had just asked your friend, you would have had a greater chance of going to the party because they said it would be fun. Asking just your friend could also make you regret going to the party if you decided to go.

Being biased is already having your mind made up, and not having an open mind about something like a new food. Asking someone for advise that is biased, might not give you the best advise. For example, if someone doesn't like you, and you ask them for advise, they might give you bad advise. Versus asking someone you are close to, will probably give you better advise, like a parent, which brings me to my next point.

Asking someone you trust is very important. You have to surround yourself with good people that are trustworthy. For example, if you are a celebrity, there will be lots of people that that will want to be friends with you just to say that they are, not because of you as a person. Famous people have to watch out for these people, and surround themselves with an especially close group of people.

In conclusion, asking more than one person for advise is better if you want to make the best decision possible. Asking more people will cast light upon more points of view so you can have an informed decision. One person could be biased and not give you their best advise. Also, if you ask more than one person you are more likely to ask someone you trust and are very close to like a parent, rather than a friend at school. All and all, whenever you ask for advise, it is a great idea to ask for multiple opinions, rather than just one because you are more likely to ask someone you trust, asking more people will reveal more points of view, and just one person compared to multiple people could be biased.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Some people want to know other peoples opinion about the topic.

This helps by giving the person more options.

It also helps by seeing if they are even close to being correct.

This can also help by giving me another point of view to look at.

Thats one way to look at it but maybe i wanted to see a different way.

Maybe someone wanted to ask someone that is experienced.

Talking to someone experienced can help by showing someone how it went for them.

It could also help by letting me know what to do and what not to do not to do in a situation.

Finally, it could help by just showing me what i'm doing wrong.

There is another way i could get advice.

Also it could ne that i just want to hear my answer from someone else. This works because it gives me confidence. It also helps me stay with one thing instead of being off topic. It doesn't just give me confidence for now it gives me confidence for in the future. Finally time for the conclusion.

All of this things give good advice which helps us make better choices. Knowing peoples opinions helps a lot.

You can make better choices, making better choices can help you have an influence on other people even if you do not know it. Advice can also benefit you because you will learn from experiences, if someone tells you what they did and what they did was bad, in your mind you will know not to do that and do the right thing. Taking advice can help you have an impact on not only you, but other people around you. In that way, having an impact on people can be a big step in your life.

Making a better choices could teach you not to get down on yourself. It could teach you to keep your head up when you fail. More people will eventually and gradually start to respect you more because of the right choices you made, and from that you will start to see the light in other people. You will begin to grow not only as a person, but as a role model for other people. They will start to look at you as a person that they know they can trust.

Learning from experiences can be a big tool into helping you make a better choice. If someone tells you what they did and what they did was bad, in your mind you will know not to do that and do the right thing. I know what it is like to ask people for advice, when I didn't want to play basketball I asked my Dad for advice, he told me I can do whatever I want to do, but I'm not going to sit around doing nothing. I took that into consideration and I decided to play basketball again, that helped me because I still think I made the right choice. Making that choice helped me because I do not think I would be where I am today fulfilling my goal.

Having an impact on other people can make them make a better choice. If someone goes to you for advice, you can help them make a better choice. That specific choice could change that persons life in some way. Seeking multiple opinions can be good because you will learn to take criticism from other people. You could make the possible choice to either stand up that person or just ignore them and move on.

Advice, you can take it and use it and you will get results in the future. Overall, making a better choice can strengthen who you are as a person. Not many people decide to actually make good choices because they possibly do not like who they are. Getting multiple opinions from other people can benefit you into making a better choice. Making a better choice you get you to realize that there is bad in the world and making a better choice can fix some of chaos that is going on.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
08C05F2480E4,"Did you know that when people are giving you advise someone else told that person the same thing! This is why some people probably don't have advise for you when you ask for some. But when people ask for advise they will most likely ask their family members, people who inspire them, and their current or old teachers.

When a person is going to ask for advise the first people they will probably ask is their family members. The first people in the family that would most likely ask is their parents. The reason for this is because they have been living with them most or their life or even their whole life. The next people in their family that they would ask would probably be their grandparents. Everyone I feel like thinks their grandparents are old and wise and know every thing but they I got admit they do have some good advise. The last person in the family someone would ask would be their brothers or sisters. You have been living with them most if not part of your life, and you wanted to move you could ask them for places they have been to that they liked or the best moving company. People ask what if you don't have any family members to look up to well who is been your inspiration in life.

Other people that you can ask or look up to for good advise is the people who inspire you. Say you don't a person who inspires you. Well you always have your parents or other family members. Most of time people who inspire you, you can most likely never see once in your life in person, so what do you do. You can go on the internet and search famous quotes that they said, or you can watch some television shows or YouTube videos of them talking inspirational. A person who can even inspire you could even be your friends. You have been with your friends your whole life so you always ask for good advise because they care for you. Well what if you don't want to ask someone who inspires you, well almost everyone went to school growing up so you always have your teachers.

While growing up almost everyone went to school and while you their everyone had teachers to teach you life skills. Most teachers you have had posters all over the walls with good quotes or great advise. You can always look at these posters and use them in your everyday life. A teachers job is to teach you life skills that you can use as a adult. So when a teacher give you advise you always use that advise any day of your life. Even after school is over you can still go back and ask them. The reason being is that they care for you, even if you were a bad student they will still help you. In the long run if you need help from a teacher you can always just stay after school and ask, go back if you have already left the school, or even look at those inspirational posters.

5C5EB17E8684,"When you ask for a person's advice on a choice, you may hear a different answer than the last person you asked. That is because of their perspective of the choice. When you hear a different perspective of a choice it tells you how the people may have experienced a problem related to yours. You can learn from those past experiences, figure out what went wrong and if nothing did go wrong, then see how you could make it better. It really helps when you know the background of most people's experience related to the topic. You can piece together the information, or write a list of the pros and cons of each perpective and combine all the pros. Finally, when you have your idea of all the perspectives you now know which choice you or others could most benefit from. The choice could now help benefit all kinds of people, since you understand the perspective of all people big and small. Asking for multiple opinions is a probably the best way to find out how to choose the best choice because all opinions matter.

The choice you make can effect anyone in a negative way, although you may not be aware of it. That is why you should ask for an opinion(s) for it. You don't know what will happen when you make that choice and who it's going to effect. Depending on what choice it is, it may effect people's daily lives. What most people don't like is change (especially if it doesn't benefit them). The choice you made could change the routine of the person's daily life, they may have more to do or his or her schedule could be way different than before. When you change something about a person, there could other people who depend on them to do something but they can't because of the choice you made. It could be a policeman or a firefighter that has his or her schedule changed, then somebody needs help but the policmen or firefighters aren't doing his or her job right now. Lastly, all of this makes you look like a careless human being. All humans judge based on a person's first impression, it wouldn't help if you ruined everyone's lives. It's like the butterfly effect, or like dominos. If you didn't care less about just asking one more person for his or her opinion, maybe this wouldn't have happened.

The choice you make can effect anyone in a positive way, because you were aware of everyone's opinions. That's why you should ask for an opinion(s) for the choices. You might know what will happen when you make that choice and who it's going to effect. It's all in your control. Depending on what the choice is, it may effect people's daily lifes (in a positive way).` What people do like is changes that benefit them. The choice you made could change the routine of the person's daily life, they may have less to do on their time or maybe something that they are offered that could be nice. There is usually emergencies where someone need help from a fire or a robber, but you could prevent the disaster from happening. Finally, all of this makes you look like a caring human being.

This has all happened because you cared for others opinions. This is why it is best to seek multiple opinions for a choice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C8D236725B26,"Life is constantly manipulating you into making decisions. No matter how meaningless you think the decision may be, every outcome will effect the path of your life in one way or another. When making a decision, it is important to seek advice from others to ensure that you are making the correct choice. In the process of seeking advice regarding a certain issue, it is extremely beneficial to receive multiple opinions rather than just one because this will allow you to visualize all the possible outcomes to your decision and experience how different lifestyles interpret your problem and its solutions.

When interpreting different solutions, there is never going to be only a single route around the obstacle that life throws your way. Imagining all of the possible outcomes to a decision will allow you to weigh the pros and cons. For example, visualize yourself in a scenario in which you have to choose between furthering your education after graduating high school, or getting a job to start earning money. Some benefits to furthering your education are that it will not only allow you to become an expert in a particular region of work, but it may influence the decision of future managers seeking employees. This is because when your resume shows that you went to a university, this will impact their choice when picking you over someone who didn't make the choice to further their education after graduating high school. On the other hand, upon completion of all twelve grades, continuing to learn is no longer free. Not only is college extremely expensive once you have been excepted, but even sending in an application costs money and you are't even guaranteed to get in. Furthermore, while going to school to become more educated is a go-to for some, many others may believe that after high school, earning money, in order to be able to support a family in the present or future, is more important. Nowadays, money has a large influence on everybody because it has become a huge factor of survival. Social media influencers along with simple waitress's in small town restaurant's depend on the gains of money to be able to live. Earning money is vital to some while earning an education is just as important for others. Moreover, in this situation you may think that there are only two routes when choosing to further your knowledge versus earning money by getting a job, but that would be incorrect. It has been made possible to further an education while being employed. Technology has made a great impact on those who value both money and education. Online classes are easily available to those who have any electronic devices. Being in an online course allows a person to learn and complete work on their own time. Overall, there is always another choice to make and hearing everyone's different opinions allows you to weigh the pros and cons of each outcome.

Everybody's lifestyles are different. People were raised to believe certain things and to have varying morals. In addition to weighing the pros and cons of a decision to result in the best possible outcome, receiving the opinions of multiple people is beneficial because it allows you to view the world in contrasting ways. Being placed in someone else's shoes opens your eyes up to different points of view. This will allow you to pick the decision that would have the least amount of conflict among a group of people with mixed beliefs. For example, picture a scenario in which you have to make the decision between wearing a blue or red dress. It would benefit you if you were to ask the opinions of multiple people to see which dress was voted for the most. In the end, the outcome of picking the dress that people viewed as best would result in more positive responses when you were to actually wear the dress to an event. This comes to show that asking the opinions of several people allows for an anonymous agreement to be made.

In conclusion, it is beneficial to seek the advice of multiple people when making a decision because it allows you to visualize all of the possible outcomes and weigh the pros and cons of your solutions. As a result of hearing multiple opinions, you are more likely to pick the best solution to a conflict in your life.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

This is why receiving multiple opinions is better for some people. Seeking multiple opinions can help because it can allow you to understand through different point of views, It can help to get ideas on what you should do, and it allows people to understand where you're coming from. This is why people seek multiple opinions.

Seeking multiple opinions can allow you to see, listen to, and understand different people's point of views and how their advice can be beneficial in different ways. They might have a different perspective on what you think you should do, or what someone else thinks you should do, because we all think differently. Understanding where people are coming from, even if you disagree can also help you come up with one executive decision. For example, there could be an occasion where you want these nice shoes , but you don't have enough money so you go and ask for people's advice on what you should do. One person says, ask a family member for the money. You ask another person, they say steal the shoes from the store. In this scenario it allows you to think and understand what both people are trying to say and the benefits of each and then you can come down to which is a better choice. Stealing shoes from the store could get you in a lot of trouble, So the clear choice is to ask a family member.

Seeking multiple opinions can also allow people to see where you are coming from so they can try their best to give you the best advice possible. If they try to take a step in your shoes, and feel how your feeling about the situation then they can process and understand exactly whats happening and what they have to say about it. For example, if you are really sad about something and you talk to your friends about it, it allows them to feel empathy, and try to understand why you are sad, and what they can do to help you. Them seeing things through your point of view allowed them to feel what you are feeling which is why its easy and beneficial to get advice from multiple people. Especially people you trust.

Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because you can get ideas and see what choice you can make based off of those opinions. Like if you were to need opinions on what color to paint your room, people would most likely give you different colors. Sometimes multiple people give you the same opinion when that occurs in a case like this, you'd usually go with whatever people think the most. For example, if six people said you should paint your room blue, and everybody else said different colors, you'd most likely paint it blue based of what peoples opinions were. Receiving opinions in this case is very beneficial to see what people think, and gather ideas

In conclusion, There are many ways seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinons help because, you can see things in different people's point of view, you can collect and gather peoples opinions and turn them into ideas, and it gives people a chance to show empathy, and be in your shoes.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
80E2B7016611,"How having multiple opinions help people make better choices?

In my opinion I do think that having the right ideas others have displayed for you can result in you making very good decisions. While getting opinions from others it is very important to be able to have a strong mindset and make the right choice then have a mindset that isn't as strong and choosing some thing that could cause yourself harm and or failure. Only you can make the good decision that will come upon from the thoughts that you decided to choose to listen to. Then when you have made a choice on what you want to do will your actions speak along with your decision.

Once you obtain more than one person's perspective it is good to make a habit of hearing all the different point of views accessible to your needs. All the different views can lead you to new options and ideas. If you are open and willing to acknowledge more information as well as reasons from others on the prior situation it will help you out a lot. When you are given different aspects you are more liable to make a worthy response. With opinions you can achieve more than what you wanted by being open.

Although there are some really good ides that people will give you there are also bad ones that people will give, it is your right to be able to choose what you want and not have to worry about what other think or say, but choosing the option somebody wants you to choose and it is dangerous or wrong you shouldn't choose the idea. Why because having chosen that idea you are bringing harm along side yourself and others too. After you have made up your mind on what opinion you want to follow whether it's right or wrong you are responsible. If you choose the right opinion it will justify you more good then picking one that is not. You have a choice on the idea you will choose but the will lead to whether your decision is good or not.

In the process of making a decision or choice you want to be able to make the most reasonable one possible.

The path you choose can be hard to make but by making a list of the advantages and disadvantages will help to make sure your liability in the situation will right for you. Since seeking out opinions can be a help to you making sure that the process to your final answer is what you want is hard too, but making sure you have more pros than you do cons and you can agree that you like what is presented making a list can help make your last thought easier and safer too. The pros in the exhibited ideas can give more thoughts and so can the cons but only if you take responsibility and proceed to to use them for the right reasons.

In conclusion listening to other people's thoughts can help you make the right decision. Only if you choose the right opinions presented and don't get yourself in trouble or hurt. You are the only person who can make the right decision not anyone else hearing out other people's ideas doesn't mean that they are allowed to make your choices. The person who makes the design has the chance to take advice from others and use it hoe you want. But everybody has a entitlement to what they think and do with the options displayed to them but only they can make the right decision themselves. Therefore maybe considering my advice can help you make smarter decisions when it come to making your's.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Did you know asking advice can lead to better health and it will help you as an overall person. Here's how, when you express your thoughts and emotions its naturally better for the human mind and body on top of that, it triggers your brain to think around objects blocking your path, which will make your final product as good as possible example, if you were programming you want it to be the best it can possibly turn out. Or if you were trying to make a car. In other words it will help you not make the same mistakes and it will help you grow as a person and a leader and, it will help you with very important life skills. Throughout the conversation you may have a change in prospective, even better if helps you get a better understanding of the topic when you have different sides arguing. It helps you get a better understanding of your friends, and it gets you to know them better. This all apply s to when your asking multiple people advice.

Some reasons it can be bad to ask advice. They may give you a negative response which can be the start to a nasty conversation. They may give you false information, causing you to fail on a test or a second argument. Its always better to go from fact over opinion. When your constantly mad it raises your blood pressure which can increase the risk of having stroke, diabetes, and to much brain pressure can lead to death, potential of your brain to bleed and other serious injuries. This all apply s to when your asking multiply people advice.

I personally find it better to ask for advice both for your health and mentally, it helps my writings or arguments. Theres more pros then cons, which proves it better to ask for advice than not. For me it shows some of the good graded assignments I've had I would ask for advice from my parents or students. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
773ED9A4F7C0,"Have your ever been trying to make a big life decision and you don't know what to do? So you ask your friends and they help you with all of their ideas. When trying to make a big decision it is better to ask more then one person. asking more people is helpful because it helps you make better choices,it gives you people different ideas or opinions,and it gives you the best choice or decision.

Asking more people gives you better choices. while your making a big life choice you don't want people to give you bad ideas so when you ask multiple people there will be ideas that are good and can help you. My sister is trying to decide on what college she wants to go to while she was looking she would ask people what college do they think is best for her and someone said a college that she really liked and she found the right college. When it comes to a choice yo need the best feedback, so when your asking you ask more people because it is better feedback on the choice your going to make. I was trying to make a choice on what to do this weekend so I asked my family and they helped me come up with something fun to do this weekend. Making a good choice is hard without any help or feedback but when you work with others to make a choice it is much easier and very helpful. When you are born people start to think of names for you and its hard sometimes so they all come together and help your parents out to come up with the name you have today. Having help with your choices is better then by yourself because it makes for better decisions and choices.

Give you different ideas or opinions. Coming up with an idea can be difficult without other peoples help and ideas with different ideas it can help you in many different situations. I was doing a project and i needed some help because it was hard to do alone without other peoples opinions which I needed to do the project so when my brother helped me out I go to get his side or opinion on how my project should be done. Different peoples choices or opinions is very helpful in the society we have now because if we listen just to one person it will put an image in our heads and it wont help us down. When I was talking to my mom about what I thought about the society we are in I said somethings and my mom gave me her different opinion on what I said and it opened my eyes and gave me a new and different opinion. When it comes to ideas and opinions it helps to have more then one because having more then one can help you in many ways in your life. I went to a conference in Generic_City and I had this idea of what it was going to be like,but I was surprised by it because there were many different opinions and ideas. Different ideas and opinions is all your gonna see in life and learning how to use and see them is very helpful in your future.

Gives a new perspective. Perspective has to do a lot with getting ideas or opinions and when you get a different perspective on something it is very helpful and can open your eyes to something new and different. I was at an event with my family and we listed to different people speak and we got a lot of different opinions and different perspectives on thing and it was a very good learning experience. When trying to get a new perspective on something it takes more then one person it takes multiple people to get a good perspective on something important. I had to do an interview on one of my teachers and I asked her what she thinks about our president and she gave me a whole new perspective on how politics work and how I should look at it. Ideas dont just come from you it comes from the things you see or the people you talk to and what you have experienced in your day to day life in those experiences you have learned and have seen different perspective. When I went to Generic_City I saw a lot of different things like how diverse it is over there like how people express themselves and how there are so many different perspectives on the world we live in now,politics,and all sorts of things that are really eye opening. Learning about perspective is very important in your life right now and when you learn about it it will help you become successful.

Why is it better to have multiple opinions when it comes to making a choice? It means better choices,different ideas and opinions and it gives you and new and different perspective. When using these in your life you need to be able to hear anything and everything and learn and be succeed.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
ADA8F6319D6C,"Have you ever been in a tough situation where you need advice? Will you just take your Mom's or your teacher's advice? Or a friend's advice? Perhaps there is not one answer, so you should get multiple opinions. Seeking multiple opinions enhances your chances of making the right call because they lead you in the right direction, they make you think about other consequences, and they express the thoughts of many people.

If you have no clue what to do in a situation, you need help and guidance. One person's advice may not help in any way, though if you ask of many people, you very likely will get turned to the right direction. Then you know what to think about because everything is narrowed down. You have a sense of right and wrong and you're able to determine what is what. Having sense prevents you from making the worst decisions you can make.

Let's say you plan to not tell your parents about the bad grade you received from a test. Your class's troublemaker tells you to keep it a secret, but you need more advice . When you tell your friend about your plan and situation, he/she thinks that you should tell your parents what happened. Your friend thinks you should because know matter what you do, your teacher will anyway send an email to your parents. For this reason, your friend thinks you should be honest, so then when the email comes your parents already have the story and they can seek understanding. Many situations are similar to this one in ways, one way being how you understand the consequences of decisions better when you have advice from many people (or at least two so you have multiple sides).

The final reason why you should seek multiple opinions is that when you do, you can see the sides of the people with less of a voice. When you ask one person for advice, they represent the wants and hopes of themseleves or multiple people. Asking for the advice of many people enables you to see the desires of the people who have a smaller, unoticable voice. Even you wish that your parents took the advice of people with less of a voice in the world. You hope that they will take your advice along with officials so that they can make a decision that benefits everyone. Asking for the advice of many reveals the more silent ideas in the world with less control, so you can represent them.

Steering in the right direction, gaining knowledge of consequences, and hearing the stories of others are all very important reasons to seeking multiple opinions. These reasons reveal the truth, they show the results of decisions, and they open your eyes wider. These reasons are part of the structure of democracy, where everyone's ideas and advice are shown. These reasons show us to a better future where everyone has a voice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
56934EC946BE,"When you ask advice you go to friends family to get their opinions on something like should I buy a new pair of shoes or should I sell the old ones. The reason why you should go to different people is to know will you know who's opinion do you want to go with. People should always go to another person to see what somebody might say because what is you had a question about school on whether you should take your phone with you to school you might have some people might say no and some might say yes but it is ultimately our decision. When you go to people fro their advice you go to multiple people to see what they are going to say about something. I all ways ask more than three or more people to see what they say on whether you should get this or not. Making decisions is important when you become a an adult because you have to make critical decisions. Why this statement is important to me is when you need help you always go to your friends about or mom or dad about an important decision. People always want to make the best decision in your life. You should always ask before you do or make a decision about buying something. I also think it is important to ask more people is because what is you change your mind you would not want to make the wrong choice just because you did not want to talk the another person.

When you ask a another person you have more Intel about what you are going to buy sell or store but you should always get a different perspective about something, its almost like picking a candidate to choose and to see who's opinions is better and gives a better fact. Asking will and most times will figureout if you should get want you want or do want you want to do but if your never sure always ask a friend or ask a family member.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2

Dick Van Dyke

? Well,

Dick Van Dyke is a television show about a husband, wife, and their child. There are many moments were any of the characters could have used some really good advice. If they were to go back and get the advice they needed or could have used maybe situations could have ended differently. When it comes to getting advice, it is refreshing to get advice from different people or sources. When you ask multiple people for advice it gives you different view points based off of their age, their experience, and sometimes on the fact that they do not know every party individually.

When it comes to a situation and you never know who to talk to maybe try talking to one of your grandparents or anyone elderly for that matter. As people get older they go through lots of experiences and awkward situations just like the ones that you have gone through. The more life lessons you learn and wisdom you accumulate, the better advice you can give to people that are going through the same thing. As your body ages and matures so does your mind. If someone isnt in the situation they will not tell you to do something out of anger, sadness, or personal bias. They have a clear mind and tell you stuff with rationality.

Yes, maybe some elderly people had different circumstances when they went through certain situations. If you think that the situation is different than that of an elderly person you could try talking to someone that went through a similar situation that is more around your age and had the same or similar circumstances. Maybe the person giving advice is giving it because they made the wrong choice and had to suffer the consequences. Sometimes even asking multiple people around the same age and went through the same thing is good because maybe some of the people that were involved are similar or different to the people in your dilemma. Plus, sometimes talking to your piers is easier than talking to an adult.

It is always a good option to get multiple opinions and viewpoints but sometimes you might want to ask someone that does not know every party involved individually. Not knowing the situation personally might change their response or how they react. If they know you or the other party they might tell you something based off of the fact that they bias you over the other person or, they favor the other party over you. If that happens they might give you advice out of anger or other emotions because they know the situation too well. When a person gives advice out of extreme emotion they could cause you to ruin a friendship, relationship, or ruin your chance at an amazing opportunity, whether it be for your career or your future.

In conclusion, not every person is the same and that is perfectly okay. The choice on who you do and do not talk to depends on who and what you are comfortable with. Not everyone can talk to the same person. Some people just have not gone through what you have gone through or are going through. You need to decide what and who is easier to talk to and who would help you out the most. Never make a choice that you are not comfortable with.   ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

Many people are going through something traumatic but don't talk about it with anyone because they don't like to talk about feelings or are worried that the person they talk to will think less of them. If you talk to someone you can really help your self esteem and make yourself feel better. Besides that you can get opinions about the situation that you never could have thought of. But if you get advice from multiple people you can get a lot of opinions and solutions to really help you make the right decision on how to help the situation. Getting multiple opinions on a situation can help someone make the right decision because, it will give you a different perspective on the situation, give you different options on how to handle the problem, and just give you someone to talk to.

Getting multiple opinions on a situation can help someone make the right decision because, it will give you a different perspective on the situation. Getting a different perspective of the situation can help you make the right decision because you could be so overwhelmed with emotion that you are only thinking about yourself and not the other people in the situation. Sometimes if you are just thinking bout yourself you could make decision that benefit you but could really hurt the other people. If you talk to someone they can give you and idea about how the think the other people could be feeling, and if you talk to multiple people you can get a really good idea good idea about how the other people are feeling and how you decisions may impact them. Getting multiple perspectives of your situation can help you make the right decision on how to handle it because it will help you see how the other person is feeling and how your decision impact them.

Getting multiple opinions on a situation can help someone make the right decision because give you different options on how to handle the situation. From my own experience when I am in a situation that either makes me sad or angry I can only think of the worst thing I could possibly do to upset the other person even more, I can never think of a easy solution to benefit both people. this is why I talk to people about my problems with a trusted friend, parent or adult. Most of the time I would talk to all three of those people to get multiple solutions on how to handle your problems. I do this because then you have three different solutions then you can make the final decision on what to do. This is why getting multiple solutions to your problem can help utimentaly help you

Getting multiple opinions on a situation can help someone make the right decision because it will give you someone to talk to. Most of the time keeping a problem all balled up inside you can break you down and tear you apart because you can't let any of your feelings out. if you talk to a trusted friend or adult you can let the anger and sadness out and feel happiness and joy again. Just talking to one person is great and is an amazing start but if you talk to more than one person you will feel a lot better because then you will know there will always be someone there to help you out. By talking to other people you may not get a solution to your problem but you will feel a lot better knowing your are not alone and someone else knows what you are going through.

Talking about a situation can be hard especially if it is something really personal but by having a lot of people helping you and giving you advice you will defiantly get through it. Getting multiple opinions on a situation can help someone make the right decision because, it will give you a different perspective on the situation, give you different options on how to handle the problem, and just give you someone to talk to.

50BCAECC0F0B,"Everyone asks for help sometimes, but have you ever thought of asking more then one persons advice? Asking more then one person helps you to make a better decision, people have different thought processes and listening to the way others think can be beneficial for you when decision making. Using the wisdom of more then one person will allow you to see things in a different way then you had before.

Using two peoples different opinions can help you to better understand the way both sides think and why they think that way. Before coming to a definite decision it is very helpful to have a complete understanding of both sides. This ensures that you pick the best possible choice. Advice can be great especially when you want to please everyone with the choice that you made. You should try to please everyone with your decision, but be sure you listen to everyone before choosing.

Making final decision can be hard when you want to make sure everyone is happy with it. Representing everyone can be difficult, but taking the advice of people with completely different points of view will help you. Take the time that you need to choose, the decision may be hard but you can make compromises. You take advantage of the fact that you can use others opinions for help, and not only use yours. What everybody has to say matters so listen to everyone's advice, then make a final decision based off of what you all want.

Using advice from multiple people also helps you to avoid bias. If you had a very strong opinion on something, and you seek the advice of someone who thinks the opposite of you, you get a better understanding of why they think that way and can avoid bias. Some important choices cannot be made with any bias, for example if you owned a company and needed to pick employees to hire picking your niece who as no experience in the field, nor any desire to work at your company is not a good choice. However using advice from other workers who help run the company you could find someone to pick with more experience and with desire to work there. Bias in this case would not be good for your choice, so using others advice you can avoid it.

Using the advice of more then one person is a great help for you. It's something you should take advantage of so you make a good unbiased choice that is pleasing to everyone. Listen to people and take their advice to make the best decision you possibly can.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
04D10F678D31,"Getting advice from multiple people is great, because it can give you a better outlook on things and help you to not make a mistake. Having a better outlook on things can cause your brain to have a completely different perspective on a situation. When getting advice from multiple people you can get different opinions that you might not have thought about. For example, one person that you ask for advice could tell you to do something and the other person could tell you not to do that thing, so it's important that you also include your idea before making your choice.

Having a better outlook on a situation can make you realize if your original decision is necessary or not. I think that sometimes people don't understand that, they get advice from people but it doesn't really have an impact on them. When getting advice from multiple people you should also keep in mind your idea. Having multiple people help you with advice is very important, because if you only ask one person they could have the same opinion as you and that wouldn't be challenging your ideas or thoughts, so asking multiple people can help you have a better idea your final decision.

Other peoples opinions matter when asking for advice, because you should have different perspectives on a topic. Having different perspectives can help you not have regrets in the future. I recommend asking multiple people that you really trust for advice, this will also let you have respect on other viewpoints you might not have thought of originally. Being more informed on a topic from others viewpoints can help you not make a bad choice or decision.

People that you know will probably ask you or have asked you for advice, and it's important that you stay informed with what they are asking you about. I think that people ask multiple people for advice to really understand what their choices are. When making a choice it can be hard because they're a bunch of choices you can make too sometimes and you might not always know the right answer.

4023681265EF,"Advice, The act of sharing wisdom between people. Advice is one of the core foundations of human culture and one of the ways as humans to transfer information between people, but one of the flaws of advice is that it could be wrong. One way to get that variable out of the way is to as more that one person. Most of the time this get rid of the people that don't know what their talking about or are just flat out wrong. When I was in second grade I had to go to the bathroom, so i asked my friend (also in second grade) where the bathroom was. My friend pointed at the art room not the bathroom, so when i asked my teacher where the bathroom was she said is was right across the hall. The lesson to take out of this is more then one person can be got to get the wrong out of the equation.

Advice is an opinion, opinions have bias in them. Asking more that one person can help cut down that bias by adding other opinions in to a big pool making one bias less of a influence then what is was before you got more opinions, making your choice more accurate. In conclusion more then one opinion is always going to be better then just one.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
13294E9A7CA1,"How often do you ask for advice? Do you ask more than one person? Maybe you should. When seeking advice some people ask more than one person. It is always in your best interest to seek multiple opinions to better your final decision. You should always ask more than one person for advice because you want the best possible answer and you don't want to make an irrational decision.

For an example, you go to your ""crazy"" friend Generic_Name for advice on how to deal with something at your job. Generic_Name's advice to you is to just quit. You then go to your mom and ask for advice, her advice is to talk to your manager about it and if that doesn't work go above your manager. If you didn't go to your mom after Generic_Name you would have been without a job, but with your moms advice you have the chance to still keep your job and work the situation out. As a result, you got the best advice possible. We may not always want to go to your parent for advice, but those are the more seasoned people that can have the best advice for you.

Next, we can all be in the heat of the moment state where you just want to punch someone or something and/or cause a scene, but if you ask for advice from a person that wasn't in the situation you will get a more calm response. You will have the opportunity to hear a better decision so nothing gets out of hand.

In conclusion, asking more than one person for advice works out better because you get the best possible response and you don't make an irrational decision you might have before hand.

2AB4A19B3201,"Have you ever been in need of advice, but you just could not settle on one friend or family member to ask? I have found that when asking for advice it is most beneficial if you were to ask more than one person. When seeking advice it is best to find multiple inputs into your problem, because one person may not have the best advice for your situation, multiple inputs gives the person more options, and you can combine multiple advises, to fit into your specific problem.

One person may not have the best advice for your situation. Sometimes even though your close to somebody, they may not give the best advice. I love my grandparents, but I'm not nesscesarily going to go to them every time I have a big problem, just because your close with someone does not mean they can give you the very best advice. Good advice is not something that everyone can give. So it is important to ask more than one person, to compare and see which advice is the best for your situation. Some people just don't think like you do. Because of this some may give horrible suggestions to you and some may give life changing inputs. In conclusion, close friends and family don't always give the best advice, good advice is not something everyone can give, and not everyone can put themselves in your shoes.

Multiple suggestions give you more options. Multiple suggestions gives you the ability to mix and match the responses of friends and family. Say that someone is bullying you at school, and you don't what to talk to anyone at school about it, you can combine what your parents say and handle the situation. The more people that you ask, the more likely you are to find a response that you agree with. If you were to ask what shoe to buy, by the time you have finished, you'll have found plenty of shoes that you like. Finally, multiple responses to a question free's up the possibility to out-rule the suggestions you did not like, and roll with ones you do like. When you take in only a couple of responses, you may not get the advice you need. In conclusion, with multiple advises given you can not only mix and match responses from your peers, but also combine responses, plus it gives you a more likely chance to find advice that you like, and finally, you can pick and choose which advice is helpful and which is not.

When getting responses it's best to limit the amount of advice given. You should limit the advice given because the advice given should be from a couple people you know very well. These responses are coming from people you trust and know very well, not just the average acquaintance. You can't trust just anyone with advice. If I wanted to know what it takes to play basketball in college, I'm not gonna ask just anyone, but people who I trust to give me a great answer

When seeking advice it is best to find multiple inputs into your situation, one person may not have the best advice for you and your situation, and the advice that you need is from people that know you the best. One person isn't always enough to give you the best answer, multiple suggestions are always needed and not everyone can give you advice. Advice is something everyone needs, and is best when it comes from the many people that love you.                                                              ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
F2D9DA6E635A,"When people ask for advice they go to many people, this can be incredibly beneficial to the person seeking advice. They can make a better choice by asking multiple people because they could get many different viewpoints and opinions. For instance when your trying to get a good grade on an essay, you'll most likely ask multiple people to give feedback on your essay. It can make a big difference on the grade you get if you ask multiple people for their opinions on your essay. People will most likely have different feedback to give you about it, but if you ask a ton of people, then some of them might have the same advice for you. Asking multiple people for advice can really help with making a great essay, but it can also help with something even as small as deciding what shoes to buy.

Back in 2017 I once asked multiple people for advice on what shoes to buy, I was torn between two shoes, Air Force Ones, and Jordan Ones. It was a tough decision, so I decided I would go ask my teacher about which shoe they thought I should get. My teacher told me that he preferred the Jordan Ones, but he advised me to get other peoples opinions so that I could make the best choice. I proceeded to gather my friends that also liked shoes, and the majority of them said that I should buy the Air Force Ones. I now knew which shoes I wanted to buy but I wasn't sure which color to get them in, so I asked my brother and my cousins which color I should get them in, they told me that I should get the white ones I was a little unsure at first because I was worried about how dirty they would get, but they eventually convinced me to buy the white ones. I'm glad that my teacher told me to ask people for advice, because it really helped me get a nice pair of shoes in a great color. This was another great example of how seeking advice from lots of people lead to a better choice, but it isn't the last another great example is when you need help deciding what extracurricular activity you want to participate in.

Choosing what extracurricular activities you want to do can be stressful, hard, and sometimes even an annoying process. You might end up in a situation where you want to choose an extracurricular activity because your friends are doing it while other times you'll want to do an extracurricular activity, but none of your friends are doing it. If this ever happens to you it'll be important to ask people for advice on what to do. It might be confusing though asking people for advice on what to do because your parents will most likely want you to do the one where you are actually enjoying the activity rather than doing something you're not enjoying just to hang out with your friends. Your friends will probably be telling you to do the activity with them rather than the one with none of your friends. This is a key reason why it can be stressful choosing an extracurricular activity. Since your friends and parents are all telling you to do something different you'll need to ask someone else for advice. These examples should show you why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, whether it's as small as deciding what shoes to buy or as important as getting feedback on an essay it is always important to ask for more than just one person for an opinion on a topic.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
BBC0E1AA58C9,"When I was just learning how to play soccer I couldn't kick the ball correctly. Every single time I tried to my foot would slide under the ball causing the ball to go straight up in the air. Due to that disheartening fact I tended to get made fun of.....ALOT. I mean who can't kick a soccer ball correctly. So the best way I saw fit to help fix the problem at hand, was to ask the coach, my dad, and my best friend for advice. That would hopefully help me kick the ball better. So one thing I think is very important to help anybody learn is to ask more than one person for advice that in the future can help guide you into making better choices.

The number one person I confide in, if I ever have any kind of issue is my dad. He honestly is my rock. So as the situation arose. He was the first person I was going to talk to. So later that afternoon we walked outside and grabbed a ball. He watched me kick the ball about ten to twelve times. And, as I was doing this he never once laughed or judged me instead he gave me a helping hand and tried to help me work though the problem. Eventually he told me to stop and helped explain to me that my planter foot was not in the right place when I kicked the ball. So naturally, I asked him what the planter foot was and he patiently and carefully explained to me that the planter foot helped guide the ball to were it is supposed to go. That it was, the foot next to the soccer ball. Sadly try as I might his solution helped but didn't fix the problem as a whole. So as I walked back inside I started to plan who was the next best person that could help me solve the issue.

So the next stop in my quest to improve my kick, was my coach. As much as my father's advice had helped my kick the ball it still did not fix it. So as time when on I knew I was letting down my team by not being able to really kick the soccer ball. So the next time we had practice I emailed the coach and asked him to come fifteen minutes early to see if he could help with the pressing issue. Again he listened to my issue with interest and politely asked me to kick the ball so he could watch the way I kicked it to help detect the problem. So after about five minutes of watching me kick the ball he asked me if I could just do my run up to the ball but not kick it. So I did, the next thing he said surprised me, he told me that I was not running up to the ball correctly. Instead of coming to the ball from an angle to the kick the ball, I was standing right behind it and then trying to kick it. So just like the last time I started to use his method to see if that would help. In the end it made my kick stronger but it still was going straight up. So just as before, I sucked it up and started to think of the next person I could ask.

By then I could feel myself losing hope there was only one more person I felt like I could turn to who would not laugh at me because I could not kick a soccer ball. So the next day at school I went up to a girl named Generic_Name. She was my best friend and lucky for me she was one of the best girls on the soccer team. So as quietly as I could, so no one would here me, I asked her for help. Luckily she said that she was free after school and that we could meet up at her place to help work on the problem. So later that day I stood in her backyard with little to no hope. Her approach however was different from both the coach and my dad. She went though each step of kicking a soccer ball correctly and which situation calls for how much power, where you kick the ball, and what part of the foot you kick it with. So after a long explanation she asked me to show her the way I kick the ball. Of course even after all that the ball still went up in the air, I groaned. Then she stood up quietly and pointed to my foot and said, ""There.""

The place were I was gong wrong was which part of the foot I was kicking the ball with. I was trying to toe ball it the entire time. When in reality I needed to kick the ball with my laces. So I scurried off and went to look for another soccer ball. The next time I kicked the ball I made sure to kick it with my laces. I couldn't believe my eyes the ball went straight instead of up. I was super happy I ran over to her and gave her a huge hug. The next this thing Generic_Name said was, ""Don't thank just me, thank the people who got you to this point,"" of course as always she was right.

In the end I learned a valuable lesson for the problem, Which were advantages to asking more then one person for advice. Without the help from my dad, the coach, and of course Generic_Name, I wold have never been able to get there in the first place. After that I started to really understand the advantages of asking more than one person for advice. Without there advice I very might well have ended up quitting the sport that I now love. So without a doubt I think that asking more then one person will benefit you a lot more then asking just one person for advice to a problem. So the next time you feel like there is no one to turn to, or that no one else has faced the problem you are facing. Understand the possibilities that you may be giving away by not asking for advice from more then one person.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
2E7E6EBD372D,"""I just have no clue what to do!"" Generic_Name exclaimed. ""I don't like how Generic_Name has been treating me recently, and I heard all the horrible things she's said about me!"" she cried. ""Then get rid of her,"" Generic_Name scowled, ""Tell her you don't want to be friends with a liar."" ""Well I wouldn't want to hurt her,"" Generic_Name said with a tears rolling down her face. ""Who cares? She deserves it."" Generic_Name claimed, encouraging Generic_Name. ""Then it's settled, I will confront her tomorrow."" Generic_Name stated boldly. The next day, Generic_Name struts into school. She is like a solider ready for battle. Generic_Name stomps right up Generic_Name's locker and slams it shut. ""Hey! What was that for?"" Generic_Name questions. ""We are done being friends. I can't be around a liar and a cheat!"" Generic_Name snaps. ""Wh- What are you talking about?"" Generic_Name whimpers with tears in her eyes. ""I know you have been talking trgenGeneric_Name about me, and I'm done. I should've known. You have been jealous of me from the second we met at that dance center. I have always been better than you!"" Generic_Name says with a grin across her face. ""Generic_Name, we've been best friends since we were two. I would never do anything to hurt you."" Generic_Name sobs. ""Not anymore!"" Generic_Name shouts as she turns away. Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice is better because it will give you better judgment, help you see the other person's perspective, and could prevent you from saying hurtful things you might regret.

First off, talking to different people when seeking advice is better because it will give you better judgment. For example, if I thought that someone was being fake towards me, and I asked two different people, one might say to confront them, and one might tell me to ignore them. From there, I can decide which path to take. Secondly, a situation could be interpreted two totally different ways. For instance, one person might think that the person you are having an issue with meant to hurt you, and another might think it was an innocent mistake. My last reason is, after hearing multiple people talk about the situation at hand, you can decide which one is true to you. Picture this, two people tell me totally different ways to handle something, and I pick the non-confrontational one, this way I'm choosing to handle the situation my way. Overall, talking to different people can give you better judgment and clarity in the end.

Next, talking to multiple people can give you perspective. For instance, it could help you understand someone else's side of the story and what you're upset about may be false information. Furthermore, you could realize that the other person is the one that needs help. For example, if I am upset that someone has become distant with me, maybe it is because they are unhappy and want to be alone and it isn't your doing after all. Lastly, you have to understand how the other person feels in certain instances. Specifically, If someone came up to you and started screaming like at you like Generic_Name did, you would be upset too. In summary, talking to two or more people when seeking advice could help you understand the other person's mindset.

My last point is, talking to different people can prevent you from saying something you might regret. For example, in the story above, talking to two people would've stopped Generic_Name from calling Generic_Name those mean names. Secondly, people could take the mean things you say to heart and feel very offended. In fact, they could feel so upset that they start believe the things you said in spur of the moment. Finally, you could be saying all these mean things just because you are angry. In fact, 87% of things said in arguments aren't true, they just come from the anger in the moment. Therefore, you could just be angry at what this person did, so you say everything that is on your mind, instead of stepping away and biting your tongue.

Now let's look back on the beginning of the essay with Generic_Name and Generic_Name, but with our new outlook on asking for advice. ""I just have no clue what to do!"" Generic_Name exclaimed. ""I don't like how Generic_Name has been treating me recently, and I heard all the horrible things she's said about me!"" she cried. ""Then get rid of her,"" Generic_Name scowled, ""Tell her you don't want to be friends with a liar."" ""Well I wouldn't want to hurt her, I will probably talk with Generic_Name about it, I want to her advice too."" The next day, Generic_Name chats with Generic_Name at lunch. ""Hey Generic_Name, can I talk to you about something?"" Generic_Name says nervously.

""Sure, girl! You know I have your back no matter what,"" Generic_Name smiles. ""Well, Generic_Name has been treating me weird and I don't like it. People have been telling me she has been talking bad about me too,"" Generic_Name whimpers. ""Generic_Name, that's crazy. You guys have been friends forever. I know Generic_Name would never do anything like that. Just talk to her about it."" "" I just don't want to lose her"" Generic_Name whines. ""You won't,"" Generic_Name says, giving her a tight hug. ""Thank you so much,Generic_Name."" In conclusion, talking to multiple people is a better choice because it will give you better judgment, perspective, and prevent you from saying things you will regret. Overall, talking to multiple people clearly was the better choice for Generic_Name, and it will always lead you to a more peaceful solution.                  ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5218172D792D,"Seeking advice when your in need can be extremely beneficial to people as human beings. This is because you are basically helping your problem be solved. But why only get one persons opinion when you can get three or five or even ten peoples opinion. Why settle and believe one person when there are a whole lot more ideas out there. By talking to multiple opinions will help people make a better decisions because they won't have just one persons opinionated answer, they have more options and responses along with different point of views.

Why would having one person opinionated answer be less beneficial then having multiple peoples opinions? This is because the person their talking too could only see one side of the problem. While with multiple opinions it's not likely that you'll get all the same exact answer. The person could also not be having the best of days at the time they ask them for advice, and not put forth their best response. Just because of one persons bad mood the advice you receive could negatively effect them.

By having more options they can pick and choose the decision that best suits them. By having multiple options from other people you'd think all you have to do is choose. Which is also a great option but there is also another option which entails combining options. They might like a part one persons advice but not agree with the other part. But when they hear another opinion and have the same feeling, why settle for one when they can take pieces they like and think is best for them.

Seeing and analyzing all point of views can help people think through their decisions. By seeing all sides and taking into thought all of the possible outcomes can help a whole lot. Not just thinking about them, but also seeing and thinking about everyone who could be effected. Lets say a library is being planned to be put onto an old garden with trees, grass, flowers, and insects. One person is going to be the owner of the library and they want it there because it will be the towns first library and its the perfect spot. But the other person is the owner of the garden and thinks the library should move some where else because life and nature already live there. By taking in all point of views can be more challenging to make a decision, it helps people think through the outcomes before just jumping to a conclusion.

To help people make a better decisions, Talking to multiple people is they way to go so they don't just have one persons opinion, they have more options and responses along with different point of views. To summarize, just having one persons opinion can sometimes negatively effect them based on persons state of being. Pick and choosing opinions to suit you can be helpful but also combining ideas. And by seeing all point of views can help them be more crucial with their choices. Those are reasons why not just asking one person for advice but many people can benefit people as human beings.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
19D04291B198,"Being close-minded to others opinion isn't always the best choice, when having more than one opinion you can learn and experience new things. My first reason why having more than one opinion on something gives you a better point of view on the decision you're about to make or the advice you're seeking. For example if you can't decide on what ice cream flavor is better vanilla or chocolate, you can ask a friend which seems tastier than others. They're obviously gonna say chocolate. However, if its a life changing decision make sure that you get more than one opinion, it'll most likely help you make a better choice.

My next reason is when making an important decision by yourself is difficult and nerve-racking when you don't have someone to help you. Only having one point of view might not be the right mindset or choice. It can put a lot of stress on a person if they don't have a second opinion or someone supporting them. Some people need that extra support or need someone to tell them that they're wrong, not saying that they're always wrong, but thinking negatively can lead to bad decision making.

My last reason on why seeking multiple opinions is good is sometimes you're not sure if its the wrong thing to do, and getting the right advice from someone you can trust. Receiving different opinions might help you change your opinion on something and help you view stuff differently. A big part in decision making is getting your advice from someone you trust and also someone that is honest with you. Sometimes with the wrong advice from the wrong person might not help you make the right choice.

In conclusion receiving more than one opinion is good so you can keep and open mind to new stuff and have different views. Having your own opinions is important but just be open to others opinions.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
46D50B899316,"Everyone needs advice at one point in there life. Why do some people seek more than one Individual for advice? This is very common with everyone, but many people don't know how to simply ask for advice or don't know who to ask. Depending on what you need advice for it might be better to ask a trusted adult or a close friend. Asking multiple people is often better because an Individual can hear from more than one person and get the right advice that person seeks. There are several reason for asking multiple people and it depends on a lot.

Some of the most common reasons for people asking multiple Individuals can vary. For example: A women is pregnant and asks other moms for advice for taking care of a baby. In that circumstance the women would probably be having her first child, so asking multiple moms and even dads could really help her to be a better mom and know how to take care of the baby. Over all the soon to be mom could e quire more knowledge on being a good parent, so that she might be more relaxed if she were too have more children. That being said, the mom could share what she knows one day with other soon to be parents.

3. People often seek more than one person when it comes to getting advice. Reason for this can be because a person seeking advice might think asking multiple people is wiser because they can hear more than one voice meaning one person might give them some advice and the other gives advice much different advice. Chosen which advice to use can be tough for someone who does not know well, that's why asking multiple people can really benefit the person that seeks advice. It is crucial for an Individual to get the right advice when they seek it. Sometimes 3 people is not enough. Often times a person who seeks advice will ask 10+ people. It's pretty effective to asks 10 or more people because the person who seeks advice will hear from so many people who have experienced things of the sort and know how to deal with it/ what to do.

4. The best way to decide something or to feel more comfortable before you experience it for the first time is asking for advice. Asking for advice of course can be difficult and often a person who seeks advice does not know who to ask. Asking multiple Individuals who have experienced similar things or have knowledge on the topic would be wise. It would help a ton to talk to multiple people who possibly know more than you on the topic. Over all asking multiple people can lead you to making the correct choice and possibly even to your success. That being said, asking multiple people for advice is usually the best way top absorb needed Information and making choices.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
66288718AF60,"When you need advice do you just talk to one person or more? Its way better telling people the things that happen so you can get there view because you might not see it the way they do. When you tell more people you get more advice and thats good. Let's say that you have some things going on in your life and you want some advice to try to make it a bit better so you ask a couple of your friends to help you and give you some advice. They give you advice and you take it and try it and it works so it made you feel it better but thats only one advice they gave from all your friends so there is still a bit more. So you day got better.

An yea you might have a different thought of if this like you might think just telling one perosn is better because you don't feel like sharing your stuff with people and i get that but when you need advice do you just want that person or alot of people giving you advice.

B33757C833AA,"Have you ever needed advice? Most people have to ask other people for different opinions at many points in their lives. When someone wants advice, they may talk to multiple people instead of just one. When more than one person is asked, these people will usually have differing opinions. It is important to seek multiple opinions when looking for advice because people with different experiences may have different ideas, one might not feel comfortable with their first option, and one can combine the ideas of others to come up with their own plan.

A good reason to look for more than one opinion is that people with different pasts lead will believe different things. Often, no two people in a room will have the same experiences or ideas, so asking more than one person allows one to weigh these opinions and choose the best option for their situation. For example, a man who grew up with multiple rowdy older brothers and a woman who had no siblings might have different ideas on how to handle a disagreement between friends. Their experiences had led them to believe different things, but that does not mean that either one was wrong. They just grew up learning different ways to manage situations, leading to them giving different advice. If someone asks multiple people the same question, they are likely to find different ideas from people with different backgrounds.

A different reason to get advice from multiple people is that one's first option might not feel right for them. Different people have differing personalities, and what one feels like they could do may not seem feasible for another. One example of this is if a shy, studious, and introverted boy asks for advice from his boisterous, popular, and sporty older sister on how to stand up for himself. If the sister tells him to do something such as loudly tell the bully to stop and then walk away, the boy might have been better served by asking his mother, who also would prefer to be quiet and not bothered by other people. In this example, the boy would not have been served well by using his sister's idea because he would not have felt like he could pull it off. Through getting more than one opinion, one can find a solution that matches what they might be able to do, not just what might work for someone else.

Lastly, one should get advice from more than one person because they can build their own solution based on parts of the suggestions of other people. When people combine the ideas of others, it can often lead to a plan that is more thought out than it would otherwise be. An example of this principle is if a boy asks his mother and father how to talk to his teacher about an incorrect grade. If his mother tells him to schedule a time to explain the situation and his father says that he should bring in the assignment and show the teacher without notice, he could take the best parts of both and schedule a time to meet while also coming in with the materials to show the teacher exactly what was going on. Once he had gotten multiple ideas, he was able to put them together and make a stronger plan. This is always a possibility if one uses the opinions of many people, rather than just one.

People need to look for multiple sources of advice because different ideas come from people with different backgrounds, some people may not feel able to use the first option given to them, and others' ideas can be put together to make a new, stronger idea. If people who grew up in different countries all give advice on the same topic, the one asking can see a diverse range of ideas. The first person to answer may have had advice that disagreed with the asker's beliefs, but they are able to move on to a new person. Afterwards, the asker can take all of the advice that they were given and cobble together their own idea based on what they had heard. All in all, there are many reasons that one should take many people's answers when they are asking for advice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
F806675B9B70,"Making the right choice is easier said than done, but what an unfortunate amount of people don't realize, is that all the help they need to make a better choice, is a simple solution. They just need to talk. Although a simple solution, a sizable amount of people don't even bother to ask others for advice, even when there's enough benefits to fill up an entire essay. Seeking multiple opinions or advice can help someone make a better choice because he or she will acquire advice from different people, learn advice that was earned by experience, and will be able to use advice and opinions from the past.

Conversely, opinions from different people may help an individual make a better choice, for a number of reasons. Firstly, advice from multiple people gives you different perspectives on a matter. Using differing points of view lets you think about a problem in a different way, letting you take a different approach. Varying perspectives may even help you come to a better choice quicker. Not only that, the right choice to a problem almost always requires a diversity in perspectives, but the usefulness of others' advice doesn't stop there. Advice from multiple people also means different opinions. Even if no opinions are satisfactory, advice can be tweaked to one's liking, a combination of some, or compared.

Then, there's the opinions that don't need change. The ones that have been earned from others' experience. These essential opinions help make better choices because they're based on experiences that have actually happened. For obvious reasons, these opinions are reliable, not to mention the person sharing said advice believes that it would help your situation as well. That's not all. Opinions from experience narrows down the choices to make. This can really help making a better choice that much easier. Not only does it show a perfect solution, it helps to make the decision faster, without stressing too much over it.

Finally, a solution that doesn't require asking anyone for help, is remembering advice gained before. This solution also helps to cut down on time to make a better decision, and could amass more advice than if one had asked for opinions from others. This solution doesn't restrict itself to just oneself. Individuals may also look into their friends and family's past. Because friends and family are the closest to a person, one may easily be able to recall events and advice given to close ones.

These are some easy solutions one shouldn't try to miss when faced with a decision. You could learn different points of view, real advice that could be applied to yourself, or learn to remember the past, but in the end, they're all telling the same thing. Something that ""...an unfortunate amount of people don't realize."" Just talk. It's easier than you might think.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
BA007250F304,"Did you know that over eighty percent of the population asks more than one person when they tend to ask questions? I believe that it is helpful to seek more then one person because one many people could have experienced it, two other people may have a different answer, and three I believe that it is a good idea to ask more than one person because they might just be wrong or right or they might have no clue what your talking about at all.

My reasons for my statements up above are one because that person may have experienced it and may just know what you are talking about. My reasons to support this are one if you simply ask more than one person you may get a better answer because they may or may not know what you are talking about, two if they experienced it they may not a lot about the topic and how they can help you, and my last statement about this is that if they experienced it rather than not at all you could always do research about it more and maybe asking more people could increase your social skills more. In conclusion to this paragraph I believe that you should always ask more than one person because they might just have a good feeling that they know what your talking about.

However, I also believe that as well as what I just said I think that you may get a better answer to support this is if you simply ask one person they might not even know at all, two you could always ask more and get a better answer and sum it up more to answer it, and finally, my last reason to support it is that one person you decided to ask might not even be right at all. In conclusion I believe that you should ask everyone because that one person might not be right plus you never know you may get a good answer.

My last reason to support this is that is you ask more than one person you could have a high chance of increasing you social skills by a lot, two if asking more people increases the chances of your answer actually being right, and finally it is always good t ask more than one person because they could have just honestly tell you a lot about it if it is something they know a lot about.

In conclusion,

I believe that it is never a bad idea to ask more than one person a question or and idea.

I believe the main idea or thesis of my topic is that it is a good idea to ask more than one person a opinion or an idea because they could just simply know more about it or they could just give a more honest opinion about it.

The lesson you can learn from this is that you should always ask more than one person about a question or just a simple opinion because they could honestly just know more depending on what your talking bout while if you just ask one person it can be just a twenty percent chance either they know it or not. You should listen to me about what I have to say because why would you risk the chance of just asking one person about a question they might not even know about at all? Or why even waste your time on something when you do not even know if they lied about it even being true or not or even knowing about it.

If you do not listen to me and just ask one person then good luck actually looking for the answer you want with only a twenty percent of someone even knowing what you are talking about or them not even giving you what you want or the correct answer. In conclusion, you should just really ask more than one person to get what you are really looking for and that might just improve some skills along with social skills.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
8B4A257DC797,"Ever asked for advice? Asking for advice from multiple people can lead to making better choices. Many people will ask for advice because this is what people do when confused about a certain topic. Humans make decisions everyday without even thinking about it. But when it comes to making bigger decisions it is harder to make sure that you are make the right choice for you. When seeking advice multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, by getting multiple points of views on a certain decision, seeing options for someones decisions, and lastly by seeing all the outcomes positive or negative on a persons decision.

One way getting multiple people to help make a decision is by getting different points of views on something to help someone make better choices. Everyone sees things in a different perspective. So this means everyone will have a different option on a certain topic. When seeking for advice it is best to see many different options to make sure someone is making the best decision. Having different options for a decision can open up a variety of ideas, which can help make a decision easier to make. Because making designs can be difficult, it will be easier getting different point of views to help someone make the best decision possible. Everyone has different perspectives but by giving someone there perspective they will be able to see it in a better way so they can see all sides of there decisions. They will also be able to see what other people think of there desiscion and if they think that the decision they are making is correct or not.

Another way getting multiple views can lead to better decision making is see all the multiple options available to that person. The more someone gets to give there opinion on something the more ideas will be given to someone. To add on the that, decisions can be confusing at times. If they are unclear it will be even more hard to make a decision. People can help make them clear by explaining to them so they fully understand the decisions they are making. By getting more opinions there are more ideas on the table for someone to choose from. This can help make a decision easier.

Lastly getting more people to help make a decision can be beneficial by seeing all positive and negative outcomes on someones decision. Everyone that will give ideas on a choice or decision will also help someone by showing them the positive and negatives of the decisions they are going to make. When by yourself it is hard to find all pros and cons of a decisions. so having someone help find all the consequences can be helpful. All decisions in life will either have a positive and/or negative outcome some decision can have both positive and negative. So making sure someone has all of the options and ideas can help them make a decision just right for them. Making sure that they now all of the positive and negative outcomes of the decision they are making.

When seeking advice multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, by getting multiple points of views on a certain decision, seeing options for someones decisions, and lastly by seeing all the outcomes positive or negative on a persons decision. When getting advice people need to make sure they are open to hear new ideas and be willing to try those new ideas. Also they need to find all the possible outcomes before making a desiocion. Getting multiple people to help make a decision will help that person know that the decision they are making will end with a positive impact on society. Everyone will have different opinions on a something and will have different perspectives on a certain topic. When asking for advice people need to make sure they are not just asking one person but multiple people so they can make sure that there choices and decisions will the the best for them and everyone around them.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
3C9B9DAFB0AE,"It is known that asking multiple people for advice is more efficient than just asking one person, because it allows poeple to have a more open mindset and have a different perspective on the circumstance. Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice is a smart idea because people will get diverse opinions on the situation, people will hear out how the other person feels about the scenario, and the person will obtain more advice to consider.

Having a open mindset when taking advice from someone else is key. If a person is offering someone advice, they should take it or at least listen to what the other person has to say because most likely they are just trying to help. People should always hear the other person out even if its something small because they may have a point. When going to ask for advce try to think of people who are not as similar as yourself, because they can give you a outlook on your situation that may be very helpful. Going to people that are not as similar to your personality will have a blind outlook of the situation which means that their advice may be slightly more brutal and honest compared to someone who has the same personality traits as yourself. So if your interested in getting honest advice, I would advise going to someone who is considered to be opisite of your personality.

Of course when asking multiple people for advice you're going to get a lot of different opinions, and reactions to your situation. I would start by asking the people you're closest with then slowy move out of your comfort zone to the people that dont seem as similar. I would do that just so people can seek more honest opinions other than your friend group that knows everything about your life. When you're recieving the advice take it into consideration and how it may affect your future. By that I mean your future life, your future decisions, your future feelings. Just think about all of those things after you hear advice from people and really think hard and consider what the best route for your life would be.

If your asking for advice go to people your obtaining trust with but also people that are honest, because you're going to want to have honest opinions that will benefit your life. I think after getting all the advice your brain thinks that it needs, I would use the 3 C's. Clarify, consider, and choose. Clarify your current situation ( what you've been getting advice on. ) Consider all of the opinions, feedback, and advice that was given to yourself. And go through and choose which advice would be most beneficial to your current lifestyle.

Getiing diverse opinions and viewing your situation from other perspectives are both good reasons why people should seek multiple advice and opinions from many different types of people.

More opinions from others will help you in the long run, because you'll end up having no regrets. Some people end up regretting the choice they made on their own. In the moment, making a decision on your own seems much easier than asking others, but in the long run, asking others will benefit you. Mainly because you'll most likely live without regretting that decision. Most people will become stressed out on their decision making. Decisions can stick in one's mind forever. You'll be bothered about the choice you made, but you can't do anything about it because it was in the past. Lastly, the decision you make can scar them.

BEEE3AC55C0E,"Some of the world's greatest inventions would not exist without collaboration. Do you think that Steve Jobs started the increasingly popular brand, Apple, all by himself? We have all asked someone for advice at some point in our life, since getting insight from other people makes life a lot easier. But is it really the more the merrier when it comes to giving and receiving advice? I think that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can make more people happy, someone could catch something another person missed, and certain people specialize in different things.

One reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is you can make more people happy. If you only talk to one person, you are only getting insight from that person's point of view. But by talking to multiple people, you will get a better perspective on what most people want so you can make more people happy. One example of this is a wedding. Say you are planning a wedding but you don't know whether to serve chocolate cake or vanilla cake. If you only ask one of the guests what flavor they want, you will not know if you are making multiple people happy because do don't have their opinion. But if you survey everyone on what cake they want, you will see everyone's opinion. Therefore, you can make a better choice and make more people happy.

Another reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is someone could catch something another person missed. By asking just one person for advice, you could miss something very important that another person would notice. If you are making a big decision, that extra opinion could change your life forever. For example, say you are debating what college to go to, NYU, or Stanford. After asking one person for advice, you decided you want to go to NYU. But by asking another person for advice, you realized that NYU does not have what you want to major in and you go to Stanford. By asking multiple people, you will make sure that you are not missing anything important.

The final reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is certain people specialize in different things. If you only ask one person for their opinion, they might not know what to do as well as someone else who specializes in the thing you are asking about. Say you are planning to build a pool in your backyard. By only asking an architect, you will know how to make the pool functional, but you will not know what shaped pool is best, what concrete you should use, or where in the backyard is best for the pool to go. But by asking a designer too, you would have a better looking pool since they specialize in making things look good on the outside.

These are the reasons why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. In this generation, people are collaborating more and more. But without people giving and receiving advice, we would not have all these miraculous advances in technology, fashion, agriculture, and more. Because you can make more people happy, someone could catch something another person missed, and certain people specialize in different things, asking multiple people for advice can help someone make a better choice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

Some people like to ask one person for advice but its good to ask multiple. One of my friends got in trouble and he aid you are the only one I asked for help and I said ask more people so you can get more opinions. And everyday sence then i been asking multiple for there opinions. I think that multiple opinions is good because, it makes us think about it, the people that we asked could tell the out come, it helps us do the right thing.

The way I think that getting multiple opinions helps us think is. When you go home you spend time on trying to fix it and you think about all the advice you get. And when you think about all the advice it make you want to do some of it. What I do when I know i'm going to get in trouble I ask people what I should do and when they tell me i do the right thing. Thinking about what the people said helps me get all the stress of my mind so I can say what happen and don't get in trouble.

When I ask the people for advice I also ask what was the out come and they tell me. Asking for the out come can help to because it lets you know that they did the right thing so I can too. Knowing the right or wrong thing to do is good but I feel like asking for the out come is better. Would you rather know the out come or know that its right. Its a lot of advice you can ask for and getting the out come is going to make the advice better.

When getting advice it help us do the right thing. Like one time I asked for advice it was good and it help me do the right thing. My friend once told me some good advice and I used it and it help me do the right thing. Doing the right thing help doing good in life and if ypu don't do the right thing you would proubly have a ok life. All of the advice

I get I use it so I can have the best life ever.

I think that multiple opinions is good because, it makes us think about it, the people that we asked could tell the out come, it helps us do the right thing. Thinking about what the people told you give me a lot of self control. When I ask for advice I ask for the out come so I know if its the right thing to do or the bad.

Secondly having others opinions on money spending can make not to spend as much money as you wanted to spend. Another example is that My friend and I went shopping the other day, and I wanted to buy something very expensive, but my friend said that it was not worth and told me to buy something cheaper so i can buy more things. Finally when you make money and receive more money people always ask if it is a good idea to spend it right away. For example, usually when my Dad receives his paycheck he puts some money in a box that says savings, then in another box labeled bills, and all of the money that he did not put in the box he puts it in his wallet and he uses the money to spend. so whenever i ask if i can spend some of my money he says to save it.

97DC786559D4,"Have you ever been stuck on a difficult situation?

Well try seeking multiple opinions!

Seeking multiple opinions can definitely help someone make a better choice.

Seeking opinions can help you by hearing on which opinions are better, learn from other's experience, and can help explore your mind on other options.

Hearing different opinions can help you choose which opinion is the best.

For example, when I was designing a dress for a friend, I asked my mom which fabric will work best.

My mom suggested cotton and gave her reasoning why, but when I asked my sister she suggested silk.

My family will always have different opinions when I ask for advice.

Therefore, I will always ask them first to see their opinions.

Another example is when I was trying to decide if I should go to the cardinal.

A few of my friends had said no because they have heard horrible things about it, but most of my friends said yes.

I decided to not go because of the cardinals safety issues.

This example shows on how hearing different opinions can reflect on me.

Lastly, I was having some difficulty on if I should straighten or curl my hair.

I had asked my friends and they recommended that I curl my hair.

This shows that hearing different opinions can change on what you think.

All of these examples help me out on a daily basis.

Hearing different experiences can also help you choose on your situation.

For example, when I asked my sisters on which elective was the most amusing, they had both said FACS.

They both recommended me FACS because they had a lot of fun in that class in their past.

Other peoples experiences can help me a humongous amount in choosing electives.

Another example is what type of job I want to have in the future.

Since my dad is a lawyer and my mom is a nurse,

I can hear both of their experiences on their jobs.

Their sharing of experiences puts my mind into a different aspect.

Lastly, when I had asked my friends on which clothing brand has the best quality of shorts.

From all of my friends shopping experiences, they had said American Eagle.

Sharing experiences also helps me choose which clothing brand is the best for shorts!

Sharing experiences can change my entire mind on what I should do.

Seeking for multiple opinions helps your mind explore on even more options.

For example, when I asked my friends for where I should go for spring break, they recommended to me Mexico or California.

I wasn't interested in either so I decided Jamaica!

This example shows on how my mind decided to explore and choose a different state or country.

Another example is when I asked for my friends opinion on the outfits I had picked and they all either chose outfit one or outfit two.

I decided to be bold and go for outfit three.

This shows how my mind went to a different path.

One last example is when I had asked my sisters which book I should read and they both recommended me Cinderella.

I chose sleeping beauty instead because it caught my attention.

Although they both had said Cinderella, I still chose Sleeping Beauty.

Hearing multiple opinions can explore my mind on way more options I can choose for the future.

I believe that seeking multiple opinions has a huge benefit on you and your future.

Seeking opinions will help you choose the best options, hear from others experiences, and explore your mind for greater potential!

Overall, these all have a huge impact on everyone.

Seeking multiple opinions can even change the word!",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5EA83BC0530E,"When you need advice, who do you go to? I immediately turn to my friends. By seeking multiple opinions, you will ultimately make the better choice. This is because different people have various perspectives, experiences, and information.

First, you should consult multiple people because they can have different perspectives. One person might see the situation one way, while another could view it in a completely different light. For example, when I was trying to decide between running cross country or playing soccer, I asked my friends. Since they both had different relations to the sports, they had conflicting opinions about which sport I should choose. They both gave excellent points for the different sports, and, in the end, had a large impact on my decision. Even if the people you talk to have different viewpoints, they can still give you valuable information that is key to making your decision.

Second, it would be wise to ask many people for advice because they have varying experiences. For me, many of my friends' ideals or opinions are shaped by their experiences. Some peers may have a positive experience and others could have a negative experience regarding your situation. If the majority of the people you consult have a certain experience, it can very much help you determine the choice you wish to make.

Lastly, I strongly suggest going to a number of people for their input because they could have different pieces of information. Personally, my friends always seem to have different bits of information about a certain topic that I never could have acquired by myself. Sometimes, it is the information that your consultants give you that can completely shift your idealogy, and, ultimately, your preference. Information is always very important, and the more people you ask for it, the more knowledge you will receive.

In Conclusion, by seeking multiple people for advice, it can make your final decision drastically easier to arrive to. From personal experience, I can confirm that talking to more than one person about a choice is simply the most helpful thing to do. We all know decisions can be difficult, but by talking to multiple people, you can further assure that you are making the right choice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F4280C0353B0,"How many people do you go to when you need advice? People usually go to more than one person like their mom, dad, sibling, aunt, grandparents, friends etc. People ask other people for advice because they think that a different perspective might help them make a better choice. Sometimes it does work. Seeking multiple opinions is helpful because, sometimes people have more experience, you'll get different opinions and next time you'll know who to go for advice.

People always ask to someone who has more experience. This is usually someone who's older than you, been through the same stage or knows you closely. For example, maybe you go to your mom for advice. Your mom is older than you, she might have been confused like you and nobody knows you more than your mom. Whenever a person goes to ask for advice their is always person he/she goes to that's an elderly.

Another reason, is that you'll get different opinions. So then your brain will work differently, you'll have multiple choices and your decision won't be biased. Like, maybe you want to go to a specific college, but your still not sure. So you ask for some advice. After you listen to different people's opinions, your brain will work differently. Then you'll realize that their are many other choices and then when you finally decide to go, then you won't blame yourself for being biased. So it's good to get different opinions because they will really help you.

Finally, if you ask for advice once then you'll know who to go to next time. After you ask advice from one person than you'll go to them again because, you know them really well, you trust them now and you know that they will help you no matter what. For example. you ask you grandmother fr help again. You go to her because, you already know each other really well, you trust each other and you know that she will do anything to help you. So once you ask for advice, you'll know who to trust next time.

In conclusion, seeking advice from multiple people is helpful because, you'll get multiple choices, you'll know who to trust next time and some people will have more experiences to share. You'll get multiple choices because your brain will work differently, you'll get lot's pf options and your decision won't be biased. You'll know who to trust next time because, you already know them, you trust them really well and you know that they will help you no matter what. Some people will have more experiences because, they are older than you, they have been through the same stage and they know you really well.

Seeking and following the advice from others could have a positive and a negative impact of a person. The positive impact would be you could get a better understanding of something from them. The negative impact could be that someone is ""feeding you some unhelpful information"" so it could mess up you hole life up.

D5D12DBE04B6,"Making Decisions

When making a decision or asking for advice, you may ask for help. But, when you do, how many people do you ask? If I go shopping at the mall, and don't know what outfit i'm going to wear for tomorrow, I would most likely ask 2 or 3 people. I could've just asked 1, but who does that. While seeking multiple opinions, it can help someone make a better choice because 2 or 3 opinions are better than 1, it's easier than going of 1 opinion, plus it just makes since.

It's like flipping a coin or playing rock, paper, scissors. While flipping a coin I already know that I want it to land on heads, but if it lands on tails, i'm most likely am going to keep flipping that coin. And when playing rock, paper, succors with my friends we always say, ""best 2 out o 3 wins"". So that is basically saying that 2 or 3 opinions are better than 1.

When you need advice are help making a decision, it's way easier than going off of one opinion. I don't know why, but it just is. I know your probably thinking, ""I could just ask 1 person and my problem could just be solved"" but, is it, is it really. If you ask 3 people to help you make a decision and 2/3 people tells you to go with that choice, your most likely going to feel more confident in your decision. And you know what they say, ""confidence is key"".

Lastly, it just makes more since. Who honestly just asks 1 person for their opinion and is just ok ay with it. It's like you're taking a test but you're unsure of the answers to the questions. Then you have to type the answer inside of a box but, I remind you that you're unsure of the answer.

But, another question is multiple choice and you eliminate C and D, that's confirmation that the answer is either A or B. So now it's only 2 out of 4 answer choices left and now you are feeling more positive about selecting your answer.

When asking more than one person for their opinion and they give you the same answer, that's basically confirmation that you should pick that option. But on the other hand if you ask just 1 person for their opinion they might leave you feeling unsure of your self and your decisions.

So in conclusion, that is why I think that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Now after reading this article, when you need a little advice or help making a decision how many people would you ask?

I would not recommend asking only 1 person for advise, but asking multiple people I give 5 stars.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
4D01E3613C86,"I think asking multiple people for advice is a very helpful thing because it gives people more to think about. Different people have their own reasons on their own opinions. It helps a lot of people when asking different opinions especially if the topic is very con traversal like sports on who is better then others and thats why it's good to ask for reasons as well. The person asking might also not know about what he or she is specifically asking advice for.

Asking multiple people is like asking what color is better and why. It's always a good thing to ask obviously if you don't know anything about the topic. Someone can give you a reasonable reason to make you be on one side of the topic more then the other. People's opinions can also give you more knowledge about the specific something. People should always prove their answers especially opinions because different people like to give false information.

Multiple advice from others with reasonable reasons can lead to an actual fact. There is a difference between a fact and opinion but then there are personal reasons. Most are mostly opinion based topics where something is better then the other or someone looks better thats all just actual opinion. When asking people for someones opinions on whatever it is you should compare two people's reasons. Also when asking for advice let them know why you wanna know.

When listening to peoples opinions or advice make sure it always makes sense. Asking for ones advice will want you to listen to others. And when Asking for their advice or opinion make sure you keep asking until you feel comfortable. I know a lot of people dont like when others asking for their opinions but it's actually a good thing sometimes it's more helpful then others think and a lot of people dont like it it because they are either scared or don't know anything about the topic. When people do ask it's mostly because they want to hear if someone else will say the same reason as to why they picked what they picked.

In conclusion asking multiple people for their opinion or advice is con traversal but it does help and it does let you know more about what your asking. Example of asking for this is what is better a stripped tee or a plain tee and why is it better. It's never a bad thing just know when you ask for someones opinion make sure your asking someone who knows a lot about the specific topic or whatever it is. asking multiple people for advice can make you let others know about the specific topic. Don't ever feel embarrassed asking others for advice because once you know a lot about the topic or what ever it is then people will start asking you about the topic so then your going to know what is true and what's not true. Asking others for advice is for things you don't know.              ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
1BF9FD62E30B,"When making an important choice, do people ever wonder if they should have asked more than that one person? Do they ever wonder if that one kid they asked had a biased opinion or if people in general have different opinions? When making a big, important choice, people, especially young adults and teens, should seek more than one person's opinion. People could have different past experience with lots of things and might help people decide when making an important choice. People should seek more than one opinion when making an important choice because people can have different past experience, people can be biased, and people can have different opinions about the subject matter.

When making an important decision, lets say adopting a dog. People would want to ask multiple people if this would be a good idea or not. Adopting a dog is a big choice in someone's life and the person should seriously think this through. For example, lets say the person asks somebody who, in the past, had a dog who would always use the restroom in their house. That person probably would not recommend getting a dog. But then, if you ask a little kid who loves their dog very much and cuddles with it daily, they would recommend a dog. Now what if this individual had only asked the person with the bad dog? This person would now be denied their life time companion and emotional support. This exemplifies why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice. Now what if somebody wants to travel the world and they ask somebody about it. One person hated traveling, they were sick,got a bunch of stuff stolen from them,and got lost. This person hated traveling and would not recommend it to the person wanting to travel. This person had a bad past experience. But what if the person asked another person about traveling. This person absolutely loved traveling. They loved everything from the unique culture, to the flying in airplanes, to trying new things. This person had a good past experience with traveling and would recommend it to the person wanting to travel the world. This is another example of why getting multiple opinions before doing something because they could have different past experience. People with different past experience will have different opinions on certain matters.

People have biased opinions about certain matters. Imagine if a person is trying to open a farm, but the person's best friend hates all farmers. The best friend has a biased opinion towards farmers and hates all of them. When the person asks the best friend if they should start a farm, naturally the best friend will say no. But if the person asks someone who loves animals and the outdoors, that person would say they should open a farm. If the person had only asked the biased best friend who hates farms, they would now not have a job and place to live that they are happy with. This is one example of why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice because people have biased opinions. What if a girl wants to try out for a football team. All of her friends say that is gross and annoying because girls can not play football. This is a biased opinion about girls who play football. While all of the girl's teachers and family say that is a great idea and the change the school needs. If she would not have asked her teachers, she wouldn't be on the team. That is why you should ask multiple people before making an important choice like starting a farm or joining the football team.

People feel differently about lots of different things, whether they are small issues like shoes being ugly, or big issues like political opinions and whether schools should have dress code. What if someone wants to buy a Cadillac. Obviously, Cadillacs are expensive and the person would ask somebody before spending their hard earned money on a Cadillac. If the person asks their best friend who thinks they are ugly if they should get a Cadillac, they would obviously say no. The best friend has an opinion on Cadillacs. If the person had asked somebody who thinks Cadillacs are amazing, they would say to buy it. This is an example of why asking multiple people before making a choice is good because they might have different opinions. If someone wants to open a donut shop, but their uncle hates donuts. When they ask their uncle if they should open a donut shop, he will say no. He has an opinion of thinking donuts taste gross. But when they ask their sister who loves all desserts and will always support her sibling. She will say yes because she has an opinion of loving sweet foods and her siblings. This is an example of why people should ask more than one person before they do something. The student president might want to start a book club. A lot of students a do not like books because their teacher made them read a boring book three years ago and they have not liked books since then, they have an opinion on books from a long time ago. The teachers, on the other hand, love this idea because they think that students these days do not get enough reading time in and a book club would be a good idea. If the student president would not have asked the teachers if they liked the idea there would be no book club. This is why people should get multiple opinions before they do something because people have different opinions about things.

When people ask for advice, they should always seek more than one opinion because the people they ask could have different past experience, be biased, or have different opinions about the matter. When asking for an opinion in something, always ask different people and different kinds of people. People can have different opinions about things and be biased. Asking biased people for an opinion on something is never good so that is why people ask more than one individual before they make an important choice.

C8FB2508978A,"Did you know that when people look for opinions they look for advice? In the prompt it states that seeking multiple opinions when seeking for advice can help make a better choice. I agree with this statement because of choices, opinions, and the point of view of this prompt.

First, the point of view.

persons point of view, the opinions you get from the people is their opinions but sometimes the person whos asking for advice will have to go to another to get their point of view. Depends on situation, the point of view really depends on how and what your situation is, like lets say they are in a fight with their best friend and they go to there parents for help, the mom might just say to talk to her and their dad might say dont talk to her anymore. Many different choices, before the person chooses they usually gets points of views from other people for advice some of these choices can be tricky to choose from.

Next, opinions, the point of view, this person who is looking for some advice. The opinions really depend on the persons point of view. different opinions, opinions can be tricky some opinions are a lot of different then others. Seeking opinions, opinions are the point of view towards the choice this person is about to make so sometimes people ask more than one person to get a different point of view.

Finally, choices, hard choices, choices can be a whole lot better when you seek different opinions from other people. Like lets say the person has a choice between their best friend and their new friend they get along with so well, this choice is very hard to choose from. Many choices, choices can come in many different ways like lets say one person has a choice to eat pizza, pasta , or eat a salad they have more then two choices and they are only aloud too choose one. When one person is looking for advice on a choice one will usually would go with the opinions that work the best for his or her choice. It really doesnt matter what they choose it only matters what the opinion, and situation, or the choice this person is in.

Seeking multiple opinions when seeking for advice can help make a better choice. I agree with this prompt because of the point of view, the opinions, and finally the choices. Opinions and choices happen in our everyday lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
EF478C3A8264,"If one person told you that you were dumb, but everyone else thinks you're smart, would you believe just that one person? Of course you wouldn't. That ideology goes the same for advice. It's better to ask multiple people for advice than just one person. It can help you differ right from wrong, it can make you more confident with your choice, and everyone has a different perspective on life.

Firstly, it's important to find out what's right and what's wrong. Asking a lot of people for advice can help you see what your peers believe in. Asking older, wiser people for advice is a great way to learn. Older people have went through more experiences and have true reasons for what they believe in versus a more younger, inexperienced person. To give an example, say you broke your mom's favorite vase. You ask only one of your friends about it, and they say, ""I'd lie so I wouldn't get in trouble."" This is what this one person believes in but say you ask more friends and family. They all say being honest is better than lying. You obviously take the others advice and don't get in a lot of trouble. You then learned a good life lesson for the future.

Another reason is that this can help you become more confident with your choice. It's very stressful to be put in a situation that you don't know the answer to. You can feel boxed in, paranoid, and even depressed. Asking one friend may help with your situation but you may still feel insecure about you choice. When you ask several people and they all give a great explanation and reason, you can feel better about the situation and let your brain relax. Let's think about the last example I used. You broke your mom's vase and you feel terrible about it and feel afraid your mom will get angry at you. When you asked your friends and family, they all told you honesty was the best choice and your mom shouldn't be angry with you for telling the truth. This would make you feel less stressful about it and help you do a right thing.

Lastly, everyone has a different perspective on life. Everyone sees the world how they want to see it. A glass half-full kind of person sees the world with optimism and on the other hand, a glass half-empty kind of person sees the world with pessimism. In other words, some people see life as a lesson while others see it as a harsh reality. Their point of view is shaped by what they've experienced in their life and how they feel about those experiences. To use a different example, say you did something illegal and asked your friends what you should do. Everyone might give a different answer and it may be no help at that moment but later in life, you'll learn that everyone has different beliefs and feelings and you'' be wiser about what you should do.

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice can help you know what's right from wrong. It will help you feel confident and less stressed with your situation. It also teaches you how everyone has different beliefs and we should value others advice. Asking more people for advice is beneficial to you and can help you form a better choice. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
45D156498F73,"Have you ever needed advice? I know I have needed advice many times in my life. Everyone needs advice to make better choices. There is no one who can always make the right choice. Seeking multiple opinions will help you make better choices because everyone has a different opinion, you can compare different opinions, and some people have more experience than you.

Everyone has a different opinion. That is one of the reasons why you should seek multiple opinions when making a choice. This is very important if you want to make the best decision. If you don't seek other opinions, you'll only consider your point of view. Your point of view may not always be the best point of view.

After considering multiple opinions, you have different point of views or opinions. Now, you can compare those opinions to each other. Out of those opinions, you should narrow those opinions down to just a few. Then, you should compare the other opinions to yours. After that, you can make a better decision.

Lastly, some people have more experience than you in certain areas. Some people probably had to make the same choice you are currently about to make. They may have made a bad decision and can give you suggestions on the best choice for you. You will then have more than enough knowledge before you make your decision. This will help you make the best choice.

In conclusion, there are many important decisions you have to make in life. In order to make the best choice, you should consider many opinions. I say this because some people have more experience than you, everyone has a different opinion, and you can compare those opinions. Your point of view is not always going to be the best point of view. With that being said, if you seek multiple points of views, you will have the knowledge to make the best choice possible. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
B04EBE5811B6,"""Hey Generic_Name!"", Generic_Name shouted. ""What do you want."", Generic_Name asks. ""I like this girl at school but I'm too scared to talk to her, what do I do?"", Generic_Name questions. ""Just go up to her and kick her in the face"" Generic_Name answers. ""Okay!"" Generic_Name says with joy. The next day at lunch time Generic_Name wonders through the huge, loud, yummy food smelling cafeteria where there seems to be endless rows of tables, he finally locates the girl and kicks her right in the mouth, she gets up and says ""I hate you, don't ever talk to me again!"" Generic_Name was felt broken inside, he just wanted to lay in his bed all day and cry. As you can see Generic_Name was given bad advice from his brother Generic_Name, and probably should of asked more people on what to do. Things like this happen all the time, if Generic_Name asked more than one person than he probably wouldn't do what he just did. Asking more than one person for advice is better than asking just one person because you can get different views of things, you will have more choices on what to do, and someone you ask could be in a bad mood or under a lot of stress and not be thinking straight.

First off asking more people for advice can help you get different views of things, which is always better. If you just ask one person they might not know a lot about the subject as much and give you bad advice. Generic_Name probably didn't know about girls at all considering that he just told his brother to kick the girl that he liked in the face. Generic_Name should of asked his dad instead because he probably knows more about things than Generic_Name does. You also have to know who to ask to get the best view of something, like your six year old brother probably does not have the best view of things, but you mom or dad probably has a better one because they have more experience. If Generic_Name had asked his mom how to talk to the girl that he liked she probably wouldn't of told him to kick her in the face. Next time Generic_Name is asking for advice on girls he probably won't ask Generic_Name again. Generic_Name may be a good brother and wish nothing but good for Generic_Name, but he doesn't have the best view on girls.

Next, if you ask more than one person for advice, then you will have more choices on what to do, like if Generic_Name had asked his mom for advice also, not just Generic_Name, then he probably would have chosen his moms advice over Generic_Name's, but sadly he only asked one person for advise and he did the wrong thing. If you ask a lot of people what to do than you can take all the advice given and choose what you think was the best advice given. You don't have to feel bad because you didn't use somebody's advice, or totally agree with them. Although they might not know the most about the advice they're given, you should still listen because you never know when that persons advice can help you. If you ask multiple trusted people that you think will have good advice, like a parent, then they are probably giving you good advice. If you are getting a bunch of different advice then you can chose yourself on what you think is best for you with the advice you have.

After, Someone might not give the best advice if they are not having a good day, like maybe Generic_Name had just got kicked off the basketball team and was super angry, or he wasn't feeling very well and couldn't think right. If you are looking for someones advice then its not a good idea to ask someone that is under a lot of stress or emotion because this can effect the way they look at or see things, or they might not even be listening and this happens a lot more than people think. Even if the person they are asking for advice from means good they can also be really mad or emotional towards that one subject or thing, like if Generic_Name is mad at his dad and his brother Generic_Name asks what he should get him for his surprise birthday, Generic_Name might not give Generic_Name the best advice. Instead Generic_Name should ask someone like his mom what to get his dad for his surprise birthday, because she knows him the best and she is not stressed or mad at his dad. Lets say Generic_Name's mom is mad at his dad, then it would be smart to ask his grandma because she knows him really and knows what he would like.

""Mom theres this girl at my school that I really like but I kicked her in the face and now she hates me, what do I do?"", Generic_Name questions. ""Why did you kick her in the face?"", Generic_Name's mom asks. ""Because Generic_Name gave me bad advice."", Generic_Name says with a sad look on his face. ""Well honey you should go up to her and let her know your sorry and that you wont do it again"", His mom says in a soothing voice. ""Okay mom thanks."", Generic_Name goes over to his dad and asks him what to do, he says, ""You should say your sorry first, and then you should tell her that you shouldn't have done that and that it wont happen again."" The next day at school Generic_Name apologizes and she forgives him and gives him a big hug. Generic_Name felt like the happiest kid ever after that. Like Generic_Name asking more than just one person for advice helps everybody although some people may not need it, its better to be safe than sorry. Asking more than one person for advice is better than asking just one person because you can get different views of things, you will have more choices on what to do, and someone you ask could be in a bad mood or under a lot of stress and not be thinking straight.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
F7B5465E1AC5,"Sometimes when people dont get the right advice or as some people say ÃÂ¨false informationÃÂ¨ it could go badly for some people depending on what you are asking about. In this society today there is a lot of ÃÂ¨fake newsÃÂ¨ going around. As easy as it is for someone to make up fake news about you and how quickly it is for that fake information to go around might be how quickly it is for someone to give you the wrong information. What if you are asking a friend something very serious and they give out the wrong advice. That wouldnt be good for you and it would make the person look bad. So in other words asking more than one person is great and maybe asking parents and teachers for the advice is good also. I have had bad experience with getting bad information from people that i know and I did some messed up things with the advice it was given from one friend and I wish with everything in me that I could go back and redo what I did and had asked more people than just one person. Honestly I would ask close friends and people I trust than jusst random people that I dont even know. Getting more than one persons advice or opinions is way better cause if more than one of them says the same thing then its more likely to be true cause they all are saying the same things to you and if they are right and you are close to them then really take that advice in for the futer cause you never know if you might need it. Even if you and your close friend arent friends anymore and you really trusted them have a talk with them and let them know that you need help and advice that he or she needs to be truthful and help you cuase I know that, that has happened to me I needed help from a friend I could talk to and me and her werenÃÂ´t friends at the time and I sat down with her and talked to her and told her what I did wrong and asked for advice and went to another friend and she gave me the same advice thats what I really should have done in the begining before I made the chocice I did. So please ask more then one friend for advice and see what is best for you at the time and what you need help with and donÃÂ´t be scared to ask your friends and family. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
D5FABAF8F84A,"Why Seeking Multiple Opinions for Advice is Good

When it comes to asking for advice, a lot of people don't know what to do. Some people just don't ask anybody and end up worrying about whether their decision was good or not. While others ask people that they trust with their decision-making and advice taking. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision because there are more/different opinions to choose from, they can talk all of their emotions out to that one person, and if there is one opinion that is repeated a lot that person knows that's the answer.

Having more/different opinions to choose from is good for decision making because that person has more options to pick and choose from. For example, if one person went to three different people for advice and they all said completely different things, that one individual could personally choose which one is right for them. If they just got one opinion, that doesn't give them many options to figure out their problem. Different options would be good for the person that wants the advice. They would be good because then that person can get an insight on what other people would do in that situation. After asking all the people for their opinions, this person could then go home and make a pros and cons list of all of the opinions. Asking others how they feel emotionally in that situation is good too for the person seeking the advice.

Talking to a trusted one about their emotions in a situation is good for decision making because the friend can know how this is making them feel. For example, somebody went to their best friend's house and told them about how they got a bad grade on a test. They start to cry and get angry, and their friend comforts them until they are done. Then the friend tells them that they need to ask for a retake, study harder, and do their best next time. If the person that failed their test didn't show their true emotions, or showed that they didn't care, they wouldn't have gotten that type of opinion. Instead, the other friend would've just told them to retake, and probably not say anything too supportive. That's why telling others their emotions is good because they'll just get a lousy opinion instead of something that is truthful. Also, each person is going to have a different opinion/reaction to somebody who is showing their true emotions.

An opinion that is repeated a bunch of times between people is great for decision making because the person asking for advice will know that it's the answer. How they'll know is because if it's repeated more than twice, it means that would be what their friends would do if they were in that person's situation. For example, Generic-Name went to go ask his friends Generic-Name, Generic-Name, and Generic-Name what he should get his teacher for her birthday. Generic-Name said to get her a nice card, Generic-Name said to get her a coffee mug, and Generic-Name said to get her a drinking cup/bottle. Generic-Name should go with Generic-Name and Generic-Name's ideas because they are both pretty similar. Going with the same type of ideas are for the best interest for the problem.

Overall, talking to multiple people about their problem is good for that specific individual. Having different opinions can have the person get a choice as in which one they want to proceed with. Talking to their friends about their emotions will help the person get a better, more truthful response. Finally, something that is repeated a bunch of times is great because it means that it's right and honest. Decision making can be very hard sometimes and asking people for help doesn't make a person feel better about it. But, it can make the situation a lot better if this person has some really good advice from friends and family.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
56A410AD96CD,"I am going everywhere trying to find out the opinions of our city about, whether or not I should get a pet dog. Also nobody gets why I need more than one person to answer this big question.

The reason why I need more than one opinion from the people of Generic_City. Is because everyone has a different opinion and I want to know all of them. Also it will help by putting them all together and then coming up with a great response. Therefore I went through the city and the park asking a variety group of people the same question. Also all of there answers were the same but different .

Now I am putting everyone opinions together , because not everyone is going to say yeah you should get one. Therefore I want to know why that is that they would say no , and should I consider that reason not to get a dog. But I loved how I asked multiple people and not just one that helped so so much. Using different people opinions help when you are making a big decision because they probably have made it too. Also , It will help with a lot of upcoming things now I know to ask more than one person.

Also seeking the help of others was a good thing that I did. Because I feel like if I only got one person's advice that I would not really know if I wanted a dog or not. Another example I remember asking my family if I should buy air pods or clothes for the trip I was going on. Then they all had someting to say some of them were like clothes because you already have headphones just save up for them a different time , the other were like you should buy the air pods you have a lot of clothes. It was a very hard decision but I made up my mind I went of the clothes because I already had headphones and majority of my family said that. Therefore I think asking multiple people is better than just getting one opinion.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
E0B1630FB93C,"Gathering multiple opinions helps people make better choices by giving them multiple viewpoints. These new viewpoints can give them various new way to approach the decision. By having multiple ways to approach the problem, you can choose the best one and make the best decision.

Asking someone for advice can make you realize an option that you haven't thought of yet. Sometimes you think that you can only choose one of two or three options. However, when you ask someone else for advice, they might notice an option that you hadn't noticed that's even better. One time I had a track meet on my friends birthday. I wanted to go to his birthday party and celebrate with him, but my team really needed me to run the mile event because I had the fastest mile time out of the team. I asked my coach if it would be okay if I missed the meet, then he told me that I could just run the mile and then leave afterward. I hadn't thought of that because usually, everyone runs all the events just to give each team a better chance at the fastest time. So decided to leave early for my friend's party. I ended up winning the mile event, and then having a great time at my friend's party. Not only does asking for advice give you new options, but it can help you think through your existing options more thoroughly.

Another reason to gather different viewpoints is other people might view the decision in a different way. By gaining a different viewpoint of the decision, you could notice new pros and cons that you hadn't thought of for each option. At the beginning of this year I was deciding whether or not I wanted to apply for Generic_School. When I was deciding if I wanted to apply, I was mostly thinking about how hard to application process would be. Only really intelligent people get into Generic_School, and I wasn't sure if I had a good enough chance of getting in. I focused mostly on whether or not I was going to make it in, and if the probability of me getting in was worth the effort. When I asked my dad for advice he said ""do you even want to go to Generic_School?"" He told me that going to Generic_School was really stressful and time consuming, and many of the people there spend almost all of there time studying and doing work. Those were things that I had not considered before. I realized that Generic_School wasn't for me, so I ended up not applying. The different viewpoints that you get, can come from other experiences, and be applied to your own.

Other people can sometime give you advice because have gone through a similar choice. If you ask someone for advice, they may be able to take something they learned from a choice they had to make. You can apply that to the decision that you need to make. When I was in fifth grade, I was in my last year of Cub Scouts and I was getting ready to cross over into Boy Scouts. I had to choose what Boy Scout troop I wanted to cross over to. I couldn't decide on which one I wanted to go to, so I asked my great uncle, who was a very successful scout, how he decided which troop he wanted to join. He told me to ""find a group of scouts that I would enjoy sharing a meal or a tent with, because if you have that, your time in scouting will be much more enjoyable."" That advice led me to Generic_Name, they were all really nice people, so I ended up joining their troop. Four years later I'm still enjoying Boy Scouts, I've gone on dozens of camping trips, and made some of my best friends. Asking my great uncle for advice was really helpful in that situation.

Asking people for advice is very important, because hearing other viewpoints can give us a new way of thinking about the decision we have to make. The next time you have to make an important choice, try asking people you trust for advice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
30C99806C7B7,"People often ask multiple people for advice and opinions and think it's a better choice, why though you ask?

I'll tell you my reasons why.

People mostly ask more than one person for advice so that they can ask the next person for good advice if the other person didn't have any, you can take one person's advice and ask another person if it's good or not, and they can use advice that's commonly used.

First off, people ask the next person for advice because if one person doesn't have good advice or just didn't have any, they can move on to the next person who does. If someone doesn't tell them advice, they don't think of just standing there, doing nothing, because of one person that didn't tell them anything. They tell another person, and another person, and ask as many close people as they can for advice.

Secondly, if you asked someone for advice, you can take what that person said and ask if other people say if it's good advice or not. People do this to test if they can trust another person or not. They tell what they said to a trustworthy companion and say if it's good enough opinion that should be taken, or poor advice that shouldn't be taken. If it's good they're trustworthy, and if it isn't they're not trustworthy. Being trustworthy is essential for asking for advice since you can take it knowing they're not lying.

Thirdly, if someone asks a lot of people for advice and they say the same thing, they shoud take that advice since it's commonly used, which is a good thing. It's a good thing because why would a lot of people be taking the same advice if it's bad? So, it has to be great advice. It also depends on how much they trust that person or not, but if they do trust that person, then they should take that advice seriously.

People ask multiple people for advice because they can ask more close friends if one person didn't tell them anything, they can compare that persons advice to other people and see if it's good or not, and they can use advice that's mostly used. Those are my reasons why seeking multiple people for advice and opinions are a better choice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
66BFF6F846DA,"Every body has there opinion may be bad it may be good but, we always ask for it and it always great asking people for advice.

one reason why, its always good asking more than one person for advice is, because everybody has a different points of view. I was walking into school and i saw a big poster which read girls who want to do volleyball take a form. i walked over and took a form but i was not really sure if i wanted to do volleyball or not. The bell rings i rush to my class and ask a couple of friends if i should try out or not. first my friend Generic_Name told me ''no what if you get hurt.'' She told me them my other friend Generic_Name told me ''not to listen to Generic_Name volleyball is super fun and you get to meet new people.'' i had to different views and two different answers so i listened to Generic_Name because volleyball did seem fun and i get to make friends in the process.

Anther good example is you want to feel comfortable that people agree with you. Most of love to go shopping and trying things on. One day i was with my friends in a clothing store and i would try my clothes on and ask for there opinion they would tell i looked good and just made me feel so much better about my opinion in general knowing that other people agree with me, It also made me feel good

My final example on why asking for advice from more than one person is because it might seem like a bad opinion at the time it might be the one you actually agree with in the end. It Tuesday and i'm talking to my friend Generic_Name she asks if she should tell her crush if she likes him and i told her in my opinion no because hes really rude and mean but then i told her it your choice she hangs up right after that. Next day is school i pass her in the halls she talking to a group of people asking the Generic_Namee question i heard all them say yes. i felt kinda bad for saying no but its her choice and soon people tell me she going to tell him. bell rings i walked home i hear Generic_Name shouting What up so i turned around and asked what she tells me she not going to because she realized how mean he was she told me she was sorry and that i was right mad how she should have not gotten so mad over my opinion.

Those are just some of my example on how asking more than one person for advice is always good choice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
A066B195BA06,"Have you ever needed help making a decisions and only gotten only one opinion on it and it didn't help you at all? People need other peoples experiences before making a decision. The benefits of getting multiple peoples opinion's or experiences are to help people make better decisions and help people know the cause and effect of the decision there about to make.

First, why getting multiple peoples opinion's to make better life decisions is to not make a mistake that will ruin your life like other people. For example, my dad was a smoker and almost ruin his life but his dad told what had happened to most of his friends. They had smoked and they had trouble breathing,lung infection. My dad stopped smoking cause he didn't want his life to go down hill and not be able to recover from his smoking habits. Second, why getting other peoples opinions to make better decisions are knowing the long term effects of a bad decision other people made. My brother wanted too go to a high school party with drugs and alcohol, but my dad said no because he told my brother what had happened to his friends and the experienced they had when they were alcoholics who partied, drank, smoked, and even gambled. Even though my dad didn't try it he knew the effects of smoking, drinking, and gambling but they didn't listen to him and most of them didn't last longer them 50 or even went broke or homeless cause of gambling. Last, why getting other peoples opinions helps make better decisions is to not make the same mistake other people make when they were our age. My dads friend was addicted to drag racing and would bet or gamble money. One time he was racing and sped pass a cop and got fined for 150$ and got his license suspended then a few days later he got caught again and went to jail for a few months. that's why getting other peoples opinion's is good to help people make better life decisions through out life.

First, why knowing the cause and effect of something will make the decision easier to make then not knowing the cause and effect of the bad decision. For example, my brothers friend posted a picture of himself at a club before going to a job interview the next day. The guy interviewing him asked if he can look at his social media to see pictures,tweets, and comments that he posted. He saw the picture of him at a night club drinking and getting drunk. That's why you think before you post something online cause it will come back to get you in the future. Next,why knowing the cause and effect of something is so it doesn't happen to you. My dad told me a story of of this guy he worked with named Generic_Name who told my dad his life story. He was a smart guy and had a bright future in front of him but he went to a party with a friend at a frat house. He wasn't watching his drink and someone drugged his drink and then someone recorded him getting high and wasted and the video went around college campus. He was kicked out of college and it was hard to recover from and he went back to live with his parents till he was able to get back on his feet because his parents never went to parties and they never told him about drugs or what could happen or occur at a party. Last, my dad told me about the time he tried alcohol he said it tasted disgusting but he felt like his problems went away but nobody told him the effects of alcohol and what it can do to you then he got drunk at work,got fired, and then got scolded by his parents after that my dad said he would do everything he can do to keep us away from drugs and alcohol cause of his past experiences.

This is why getting other peoples opinions are good cause you can get good advice that will lead you up a bright path to success and not failure in the future. That's why other peoples past experiences are helpful to make good or better decisions and help people know the cause and effect of a good or bad decision there about to make.    ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
9BC5D2C54039,"You stare at the bland cream walls for what feels like hours, unable to make a choice; you need somebody else's opinion to give you the aching relief you need. With peoples opinion deciding what to do will become much easier. Many people seek others opinion in order to create advice for them self. With the opinion of many others decision making and good advice will come much easier. Personally, I believe that the opinions of others help one: get others points of view on the situation, give your thoughts on the problem more complexity, but it may also make it more difficult to decide with several different opinions.

When you are able to see the views of others on a certain situation, creating advice for the situation comes with ease. With seeing how others feel you are able to put yourself

""in their shoes."" This new sense gives you the ability to not only make a decision that benefits you but benefits others too. It is always important to see where others lie when it comes to big decisions because sometimes the decision you make affects them too. I also believe that when you get to hear others opinions it gives yourself a stronger opinion that allows advice for yourself to come easier. The opinions of others usually come from mistakes that have been made and lessons that have been learned which shows you right from wrong.

With these new opinions formed from others and decisions in the making, it gives your thought process more complexity. With a more complex thought process you are able to put opinions, facts and bias all into one piece of advice for yourself. A complex and thought out mindset when it comes to creating self advice is very important. With a clear, complex mindset, the entire process becomes far simpler and much easier. I strongly believe that asking others for advice allows you to make the better choice. Except, not everyone has the ability to take the opinions of others and be able to make a choice with ease.

For some people, with so many opinions, it may become more difficult to decide which choice to make. When you have have several peoples opinions, it may become harder to decide whos opinion to follow or who is truly right. After all, with so many opinions and thoughts it crowds your mind and you do not know which is wrong, and which is right. Although so many thoughts and opinions may stall your thought process it may speed it up too. With multiple peoples thought and feedback, you may begin to see a pattern. With that pattern it may show you which path to follow in finding the best choice for yourself, which may come a lot faster than you would expect.

All in all, I believe that seeking the opinions if others may be a lot easier than just utilizing your own thoughts. With the right opinions and feedback you will be able to make the correct choice with ease. A persons opinion can affect someone in many ways, beneficial or not. When it comes to advice, if you are having difficulty finding advice for yourself, I think it is very wise to turn to others for their opinion. A persons opinion can help someone or stall someone because, you are able to see someone else's point of view, you are able to think in a more complex manner, and it may make it harder for them to decide.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
8B3DB5B8F0B7,"I think seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because not all people have the same ideas and they can give them different advise because we all think different. Me personally I think this is really good because their were time where i just asked one person for advise and it did not go well and when i asked multiple people it went good and i have a lot of examples that have gone well and bad.

One time I needed help with something personal and I asked 4 of my good friend for advise and they all told me different things but I try to put everything they told me into one idea and try to do it and I did and it went really well and I think if I did not ask more than one person it would have gone well because of the other persons feelings.

Other time I needed help with my math homework and instead of asking multiple people for help i\I only asked for one persons help and I think that was not a great idea because not all people will get what your trying to figure out. I only asked one person for help so it did not go well because i should've asked other person to because everyone works differently and they can get different answers.

So I just think its good if you ask multiple people for help or advise people,who knows if there right or wrong or if its good or bad advise because from my experience its better for you to ask multiple people.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
3AC9C50357E9,"Seeking out multiple opinions can have a very positive impact on what you are getting or trying. A scenario of this could possibly be attending a high-fashioned dinner. You're going to need a suit or a dress to be able to show class. So, going by a fashion store and picking up one of these clothing items might be the best bet. But, what if the clothes that you picked out don't look good to your friend, and you think they are fantastic? You should probably ask some other people on what they think the right choice is. Seeking out multiple opinions can have a remarkable impact on your personal characteristics.

Having two or more people review one of your choices can only improve your decision and overall practicality of the occasion. You might think something is good looking, but if your friends think that it isn't, then you know you probably shouldn't go with that option. Multiple opinions can create a secure factor of your choices. You'll be able to appeal to almost everyone if multiple people agree on your choice. Having different perspectives and opinions on something has a positive outcome over the final choice. Another factor that also plays in is that if you request for your viewers to be honest, it will narrow your choices down to the very one that is perfect. This is what everyone wants, the proper item for any occasion. Multiple choices will only help this to be achieved by anyone.

So, finding that perfect dress or suit for that occasion can come with ease at the choice of multiple eyes. You will be able to view different opinions on the choices of yours. This will entitle your option to be the most reasonable. Many people will look at you and appreciate your time and choice of the item you have. This can make people feel good inside and appreciate their critiques that they went through. Everyone wants to be outstanding when it comes to all of their choices. Multiple opinions and perspectives will only benefit the outcome. So, next time when you are looking for that perfect item, ask around to make sure you have only the top option. Having multiple sets of eyes on your opinion powers the spotlight that shows your caring for occasions.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
CBCD5EF05F0F,"Do you ever think why do some people ask one than one person for advice? Some people may need to hear different side of advise. Or some people may need to hear different opionions. Some people see the things differently, so its not a bad thing to ask multiple people for advice. You miight even find someong that thinks the same as you and go with that. You might find some one that think totaly different from you and go with that. Its two reasoin why I would ask different peoople for advice to find out new things,and hear different opionions.

I needed some advice for a project so I asked my mom and my grandma. My mom told me how to do it and what to do. My grandma told me the samething so I ask my uncle. My uncle told me a lot that i didin't know so I was sure I was going to pass. Sometimes seeking multiple opionions can help someone make a better choice,.And you can find out new thing.

I might need different opionions then I might can put them together. People see thing differently so its better to get defferent sides of advice. You can ask a girl and a boy so you get the girls advice and the boys advice. I can better your chance of what ever your doing. Next time you need advice ask your mom and dad or your sister and your brother.

So you if you need some advice ask multiple people a boy and a girl. Like I said you may need different point of veiws. Seeking multiple opionions can help you make a better choice. And you can find out new things if its coming from multiple people. Remember my two reasions to find out new thing,and to hear different opionions.                                                                                                                                   ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
5E320957311B,"When people ask for advice normally individuals ask more than one person. Meaning that people try to see different aspects of a problem, question, or statement. People ask more than one person so they can find their own resolution on what others think is right or wrong. Finding the majority rule out of the two or more people you ask so you can make your own resolution.

People ask for some form of advice in their lifetime, people find different opinions at those times they get a variety of the good and bad pieces of advice. When it comes to problems such as, dealing with family matters or your job, I would look into different opinions from a counselor to a co-worker to find a certain balance.

However, when it comes to hearing a statement that may be important or held in society as something such as activism and debating. Often times, people talk about speeches as well as give insight on them and in some cases, contact the individual that had said the statement and give their opinion or give criticism to that person.

If you only talk to one person for advice you may still be stuck with what you are trying to look for or discuss on, and not have the best conclusion. Finding more opinions in a group of people will give you a good to bad ratio of what you should do to resolve on what you are looking into. Trusting groups of friends, family , and professional as well as responsible adults are some examples on people who you should ask for advice on the things you are wanting to resolve or find out about.

As you get more advice from people, you should find a majority rule on what everybody thinks, or say about your question or problem, and in some cases. Finding advice or constuctive criticism on something you did, such as an art project, a speech, or an essay. Getting a summary out of a group of people will help you get an understanding and a resolution on what you think you should do. Furthermore, when not finding advice or criticism you might not grow or expand on what are working on, not changing a mistakes on a essay or something or not perfecting something someone told you to look into.

Lastly, I see advice as a way for people once again, to find their own resolution. Talking to more than one person means that you may find a better way or summarized way on how you are going to complete or conclude the problem that you have. Try to find people who can give their opinion on what you want finished. Meaning, don't just look into one person's insight, because find just one may not always be the right one.        ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
DAA1B0DC9448,"Have you ever found great difficulty in finding the right choice? Gaining the correct choice that can lead you through life can be difficult when you only have yourself to depend on. Ever since I first got the opportunity to face certain conflicts in my life, the right choice has always been unclear. Getting the chance to talk to multiple people in my life really guided and helped me with receiving multiple opinions as well. Multiple opinions meant multiple point of views. Most of the time, we tend to go to the people we trust in life to tell us the several possible outcomes with the different choices that can be made. Through all these opinions though, the right choice is usually gained by the one we most agree with. I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of the personal experiences that take part, the inclusion of guidance, and the clear answer of what the wrong choice is through all the point of views.

Firstly, receiving multiple opinions can help some with making the right choice because of the experiences they are based on. Usually, the wise beings we go to for help are adults that play a big role in our lives. This can include parents, relatives, and as well as family friends. Sometimes our own friends can share the same situation of conflict. Usually, the adults we look up to are the ones who are able to easily give us their opinion on the choices that are given in such circumstances. Sometimes the reason for that is because of their childhood and background. They may have been in the same situation around the same age, having to make their own different choices. In the end though, whether they made the right choice or not, they would've known what the correct option would've been. Knowing that, they'd be able to give you what they think is the decision that'd carry you past the conflict that you are facing. Being able to receive multiple experience-based opinions, you'd find yourself to have wise choices in your hands for you to choose from.

Secondly, being able to grasp several opinions can help you to make a better choice because of the guidance that is involved. Once again, the people whom we trust are usually the ones we go to for their opinions, or rather, their guidance. They are all people who care for us as well, willing to help us with our conflict. Each opinion that they give you is on your behalf, knowing the outcome for you in your situation. Most of the time, they try to give their opinion knowing what's best for you. This leads us to realize that the choices they try to convince us to make are ones that won't let us down. All of their guidance should eventually lead us to the right path. The tendency to lead us to the correct choice is present through multiple opinions because of the care and knowledge that is mixed in as guidance.

Lastly, being able to seek multiple opinions can help to lead someone to the right path because of the wrong choice that can be eliminated through those several opinions. With the point of views that are given through the several people we tend to go to, there are always a few that we can argue against and eliminate. Though most may be wise, there are some that we can realize to not apply to the decision we are leaning towards. Even so, when our advisers try to convince us to make choices that are agreeable, the opposing option can always be crossed out as well. The multiple opinions given by our peers can sometimes give us the clear answer of what option we are not leaning towards.

When we only have ourselves to depend on, the choices that we make tend to be doubtful. We may have lack of knowledge and experience, so how to deal with certain conflicts can be challenging. When we have the help of others' opinions, however, our path is cleared, and there are less to choose from. I have found myself to have plenty of people's opinions to choose from, and their guidance has caused me to keep walking on because of the right choices I have been able to make. The ability to receive several opinions can help someone to make a better choice because of the experiences they may be based off of, the guidance that is given, and the elimination of the obvious, wrong answers. Our every decision cannot be made based on our own doubtful thoughts when we have the help of others and their point of views in our lives. The wisdom of others can help us gain our own intelligence in life's conflicts. Perhaps it can even help us with our future to gain our own wisdom and advisory for the satisfaction of others. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
F6BE3A555C49,"""An opinion can act like a guiding hand in a dark tunnel,"" said Generic_Name. Sometimes we find ourselves in situations where we have no idea what to do. Whether to take a right or a left or take one job over another. The decisions we make effect how we live for the rest of our lives. So, it is important that we make our decisions with careful thought, and when we need help with our decisions that we reach out to the people we trust for guidance. I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help us make better decisions because some people are wiser than others, some people know you better, and because some people have really strong opinions for or against something without considering what is best for you.

First, wiser people who have had to make difficult decisions might give better advice rather than someone who has had a perfect life. Adults and elders are a great example of that because they have had to make serious and difficult decisions that have shaped them into who they are today. They have lived through so many of the struggles we go through and they understand the emotions and fear that contribute to our decision making. Those adults and elders have more than likely had to make the same exact decision that we are struggling to make, so they can use past experiences to lead us in the right direction.

Other people might know you better, and regardless of the situation they do what is best for you. Those are the people I listen to most, because they know you and know what you should do based off of who you are as a person. Right now I am facing a difficult decision of choosing between my friends, who have been fake recently, or a boy, who can never seem to make up his mind. I have asked so many different people for advice on what I should do, and the opinion that suck out the most was the one of my closest friends. She told me that I needed to follow my heart and do what I thought was best regardless of what other people thought I should do. No matter what I do in this situation I'm losing a big part of me and the people that have made me who I am, but it's relieving to know that the people who know what type of person I am support me in whatever decision I make.

Lastly, we sometimes listen to those who have a strong opinion for or against something without even considering what is best for you. Those people are very selfish, and if we aren't careful we will listen to them. In my boy vs. friends situation I have asked these type of people whose opinions are so strong, rather it's what is best for me or not. They're so for one side and their opinions are so strong it seems like they know they are talking about. They often times have very good arguments on why they think what they think and what they are saying might be true. However, it isn't always what I need to hear or what is best for me and my life.

That is why seeking all these different opinions can help us make the best decision. Some people have very good arguments while others just know us better. If we only listened to one person our whole life when it came to decision making our life would turn into theirs and we would practically be living the life they want to live. I especially don't want someone to be living through me and controlling my life through different mind games. It is important that we listen to what others have told us, but we form our own opinions and do what we think is best for us. The decision that we make for ourselves will most likely be the best decision.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
573D3A222492,"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can find the best answer or solution, someone could have a good choice instead of a bad choice, and different opinions mean different options or ideas. When someone is stuck on something, and don't know what to do, they usually ask someone to help them, or for their advice. In your head, picture someone deciding if they want ice cream, or cake. If it's a tough decision they will ask their friends what they should get. Without their friends they would have never decided what they want.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can find the best answer or solution. Searching for a good answer is like looking for the best answer on a test, so when you need help with something, ask someone until you find the best asnwer. The best answer will put someone further in life because it helps them know whats best in life, and whats not. Someone finding the solution to their problem helps them figure out what to do. So when someone finds the solution to their problems, they probably asked someone for help.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because someone could have a good choice instead of a bad choice. A good choice is the best choice someone can find, so when someone ask someone for help they should keep asking until they find a good choice. If someone finds a bad choice, it won't lead them further in life, and will make them not know what to do best. So find the best choice when asking for help because it will lead someone further in life instead of pushing them down. Never go for a bad choice, instead go for a good choice.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because different opinions mean different options or ideas. When someone ask someone for help, they will look for different options, because then they can choose the best option out of all of their options. If someone doesn't know what to do for a project, or something else, they can ask someone else for their opinion and then they can find the best idea, and use it. Finding different options will push someone further in life, and help them out in life. So when someone ask for help give them different options, so that they can find the best one, and do better on what they're doing.

To sum it up, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can find the best answer or solution, someone could have a good choice instead of a bad choice, and different opinions mean different options or ideas. When someone is looking for multiple opinions they can use the best answer, or solution because it helps them. They could use a good choice, and not a bad choice because it leads them further in life. They can use different opinions because they can find different options, or ideas, and pick the best one that helps them. All of these help someone in life, and asking someone for help will push someone further into life and be more successful, and they build up courage just from asking.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
6D1F2EB7A389,"I had to make a very important decision recently: I had to decide which language I was going to take. My options were Spanish and Latin, and I was leaning towards Spanish. However, I decided to get my parents' opinions to make sure I was making the best choice. Both of my parents thought I should take Latin. My mom said that taking Spanish in high school hadn't really helped her, and my dad said the same. I also got advice from my teachers, and they told me which language they thought would be best. Eventually, I changed my mind and chose to take Latin, a class I have greatly enjoyed. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make an informed choice, they can help you make a choice you benefit from, and they can help you make a choice that you don't regret later.

When you get advice from multiple people, you get lots of information that can aid you in making the best decision possible. When I was seeking opinions about my language choice, I wanted to know how each language could benefit you and if the people that took the language still used it today. I needed to choose the language that could help me the most, now and in the future. Getting multiple opinions helped me make an informed choice.

Making a decision that benefits you later is another good example of how seeking advice from multiple sources can help you. For instance, I have already noticed that Latin has helped me. I have been using the things it has taught me and applying them in daily life. I can make connections between Latin and English words and if there is an English word I don't know, I can use the skills I have developed in Latin to figure it out. The language I chose has helped me so much already, and I am only in my first year! If I hadn't gotten multiple opinions, I would have chosen Spanish and would not be learning all the wonderful things I am now.

Also, seeking multiple opinions can keep you from making a choice you would later regret. When I was getting advice from my dad, he told me that he wishes he had taken Latin. He is a doctor, and a lot of medical terms have Latin roots. If he had taken Latin, he would be able to figure out what some of those terms mean without looking them up. He regrets the choice he made about his language, and if he had gotten more advice, he might have made a different choice that he was happier with. I, on the other hand, do not regret my decision at all. It might be a little early to know this, but I have seen how it has benefited me, and I think I made the best choice. I was able to do this because of the great advice I got.

I am thriving in Latin, and it is all because I took the advice of many different people. I asked them what they thought, and I collected that information until I knew what the best choice was. I made my decision and am very happy with it. Seeking multiple opinions helped me greatly and I don't regret my choice at all.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
FC3BD2A0D23E,"We should always ask for different peoples opinion on somethings so we all will have more than just one option. I know for me it is always easier to ask different people so I know what they think. This one time I had to make a big choice and I had no clue what to do. So I asked friends and they came up with great things that I had to think about. I chose one thing they said and it turned out great in the end. Asking different people for their opinion is good because I can see all of my options, so I can see witch one is a better option, and so I can see witch one is smarter.

First of all, I want to have different peoples opinions so I can see all of my options. It is good to have options so that we can choose the one we like the best. It is also good to have options so I have a chance to comprehend all of my options before making the final choice. The reason I need to know all of my option is so I do not have regrets. We should also always have the ability to make our own choice if we do not like the options that our friend gave us or if we feel like the options are not as good as our own.

Second of all, we should want different opinions so we can make the better choice. A reason for that is so I can see witch option seems nicer. I should always have options so I know exactly what I should do. I should always make the better choice so I do not live in regret. The reason we should not live in regret is because it is not a healthy thing to do and I would always be thinking about the ""what if"" and it is not worth it.

Third of all, I always want to make the smart choice. I always want to get all the best options so I can be smart and pick the smart choice. I always need to know the right choice from the wrong choice. I order to do that is I need to make a list of all the options and make out the wrong options so I can choose the right choice. To make the smart choice I need to stay positive threw out the whole thing. A reason for that is because if we are being positive then things will work out better but if we have negative thoughts then it might not work out as we thought.

In conclusion, asking different people for their opinion is good because I can see all of my options, so I can see witch one is a better option, and so I can see witch one is the smarter choice. I believe making the best choice is good because no one wants to live in regret because that would be very depressing. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5AAE43F07F55,"Have you had to make a really hard choice, and you keep second guessing yourself? Well, everyone feels like this at some point in their life. It's just if you want other people's opinion in your decision. There are many positives in other opinions other than yours. You should listen to them.

One opinion is not good when you want to make a good choice. Multiple opinions can help you find out what you really want to do, to make it a good choice. Here is an example, you are picking your classes for next year and it's a big year too, 9th grade. You are struggling to pick your last elective, you ask your family what to do. They tell you to do what you like. The next day you go to school and you ask all of your friends. They tell you to do what you love, band. So you go home and think about it, and come to the conclusion that you do love band so you go ahead and pick that as your elective. For this example you can clearly see that when you ask multiple people about what you should do, They tell you their honest opinion and it helps you figure out what you want to do.

Why is asking more than one person good? There are many reasons why it is good to ask more than just one person if you are wanting them to help you make a hard choice. One of them is, it opens your thought process, so if you are thinking a little bias on something. They can make you think about the other side of the problem. Another positive of have more than one opinion is, in the end result you will be happy. Even if it is not what you had expected, you will still be happy.

Some people dont talk to others when they feel a certain way. So lets say that your friend had her heart broken by someone, and you are have trouble with your relationship too. You go to them for help, and when you ask they give you all of their personal experience. To them it feels really good to open up to everything that had happened to them, and at the same time they are helping you. Sometimes you are helping a lot more than you think, not just for yourself but that friend.

Have you been second guessing yourself on a really hard choice? Everyone has done this at least once in their life. Their are people in your life that could help you stop second guessing yourself and make the right choice. There are so many positives in other peoples opinion.

D63BA0463CD5,"When asking for advice, it is always best to receive different viewpoints from multiple people. Asking for that advice supports the decision maker by giving them options based on the advisers' viewpoints. Furthermore, it educates the mind of the decision maker for future references related to that topic. In addition to being educated, it gives them an idea of what others may think of the topic. They can then make inferences about the person based on that advice.

Giving the decision maker more viewpoints to look at lets them have a better idea of what they would like to know. When someone asks others for the viewpoints of an idea, they are likely to tell that person what they believe about the idea. The advice may be vitally important to their decision, or irrelevant in all ways. That is why getting advice from multiple beings helps the decision maker when making their decision, simply because it narrows down their options, based on what they also believe on that topic. For example, if someone is trying to make a decision, they are most likely going to ask multiple people for options. Then, using those options, they would make a decision based on what they believe is best for them.

Seeking multiple options also makes the decision maker more educated for future discussions and references related to or based off of that topic. From the advice given to them from multiple people, they are able to make suggestions and hopefully give advice to others to help them with their decision making. That advice may be vital to the decision maker's life, only because it would make them more intelligent for the betterment of their well-being. Nevertheless, the information given to them could be used to educate themselves and others in the future.

When asking for advice, the decision maker also gets to know more about the person they are asking. For example, if a person asks someone what they think about an idea, the adviser would most likely tell them what they believe. As a result, it causes the decision maker have an idea on what the adviser thinks about a central thought or belief. Then, using that information, the decision maker can make inferences about how that person thinks or what they believe. That information can be very important because the decision maker could decide to ask that person for advice more frequently, depending on what they think of them or their advice.

Getting advice is always useful in life, given the fact that it can use in many different ways. First of all, getting advice from multiple people can influence the decisions of someone in need of it. The advice given could support the decision maker's viewpoints, or oppose of it. However, the opposing advice could positively influence the decision maker. They could become influenced based on the supporting details of their reason to believe in what they think. Next, the advice given to the decision maker could educate their mind in many different ways. If they want to use the advice given to them in the future, they would most likely want to use the best advice received, therefore, try and get as much advice as they can so they have a plethora of options to choose from when they want to use this to their knowledge in the future. Finally, the decision maker can get to know more about someone, especially the person advising them. The decisions made by someone are usually based off of the information given by others. The decision maker gets an idea of how someone thinks and what they believe in from the advice given to them, and they can then use that information to make inferences on that person. Hopefully, the information about the adviser created by the decision maker will be beneficial to the decision maker.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

secondly why i think you should get you advice form other is that you get to pick out if the situation you are is bad for yuo or no like for exmaple if you are in a risk taken situation that you think you should do and you ask your mom if you should take the risk your mom might say no just to keep you safe but if you ask someone else that is a risk taker they might tell you to take a chane go thourght with it.

Some people have trouble deciding over items, so the person could look for multiple people to help them decide, one person could say one thing and another person could say a different thing, the person would have to ask more people and base it off of the reasons he was given. Reasons why people should ask more than one person is that they can have more than one answer or opinion, and it can help them decide through multiple ideas.

People should ask for multiple opinions because they can acquire more than one answer. Having more than one answer can help you decide. Generic_Name could not decide on which pack of bananas to choose at the store so she asked two workers which they preferred best. Another reason why you should have more than one answer is so you would have more to work with. Generic_Name asked people which lawn chair was the best to purchase, he obtained multiple answers and used them to choose a lawn chair.

Many people should ask for multiple opinions because it can help them decide through the ideas they obtain. A reason for that is that it can make for a better decision. Generic_Name acquired multiple ideas from asking people so she can make a better decision on what she is going to purchase. Having multiple ideas to decide with can help you have more to work with. Generic_Name was able to think easier with having more opinions on where he should eat at.

Another reason you should have multiple ideas is so it wont stress the person out trying to choose it. Generic_Name did not stress over buying a new house because he asked his parents and friends to help him decide.

These are the reasons you should have more than opinions when making a decision. It can help you with more than one answer to help you decide and to have more to work with. It can also help with multiple ideas, help you make better decisions, help you decide by having more to work with, and helping not to stress over the decision. Those are the reasons to get more than one opinion to make a decision.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
2874CC27310F,"If you get opinions and are getting advice from multiple people,would it be better or worse. It would be better because you would not only have one persons opinion to go off of but more.

You may not agree with this person that gives you advice. They could give you advice that you may not really like.

That's why you want to go to multiple people to get advice from. When given advice, you want to at least agree with the person that is giving you the advice. If you don't you might not want to follow their advice anymore. If not just go to other people and see if they have any better advice.

One person could give you better advice than someone else. If you only go to one person than you could of missed so much advice that you could of got from someone else. You always have a chance to get better advice. That's why you don't only take advice from one person. Somene can give you good advice but there is always someone with better advice to give you.

Its always good to get different opinions and different advice from multiple people. You may not agree with them or not get the best advice ,when you could have got better. You should not go off of one person's advice. You should go off of a lot of different people's advice. It's better for you in the long run. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

The reason why people ask multiple people cause everybody has a different opion on the same questions. Not all people are the same and some may think the same thing. But you always need to ask multiple people so you make sure you know for sure. And just cause u asked another person dosent mean there opion is right. And say you ask for advice for some help some kids just like to joke around. So there was this one time where i really needed help with some work and i didnt know how to do it so when i went to ask all they did was joke around and tell me wrong answers. So what i did was i went to the teacher and asked him for help so when i did that he actually made me understand it so what i'm trying to say is if your friend likes to joke around when u actually need help just ask a teacher cause there gonna pay more attention then one of Ur friends will. And I had another time where I really nedded help getting my basketball form better so i tried asking my brother but he didn't help so I asked my rec basketball team so i satrted to do better in practice so thats when my coach put me as starter.

B17127A30AC0,"The main reason people go to others for advice is because they couldn't seek it on there own. Plenty of people don't understand how helpful it is too talk to someone else or get advice from others. some people could be going through the same things you are or have experienced the same problems as you. If they have moved on from it and learned from it than they should be able to help you do the same. Seeking help or advice from others isn't and never will be a bad thing. Sometimes you just can't do it on your own even though you say you can. I'm almost positive that most people have experienced one or two problems they needed help with.

Getting multiple opinions from different people is a great option. It gives you more options to work with in the long run. When it comes down to it you might need those other options because the one you have tried just didn't work out how you planned. when I was younger I used too deal with serious family problems, I would always go to my grandma for advice. She always knew what to say and what would help cheer me up, but there were sometimes when her advice just wasn't what I was looking for. So I would go talk to other family members including my grandpa, brother, and aunt, but I didn't just talk to family members about my problems. I realized that I needed a counselor, so I went and got one and surprisingly they helped a lot more than I expected.

I know a lot of people out there don't like to seek advice from anyone because they are scared that nobody will listen to them or that someone will make fun of them. I understand all of that but, seeking attention with someone you know is gonna help like your mom or your grandmother, or just any family member in general would still be a good idea or at least one you should think about. because you never know people could be there to help you and want you to be happy, not bring you down and see you sad. seeking multiple opinions from different people gives you more room to think on the decisions you wanna make and help you make better choices. When having multiple opinions it really gives you the chance to think about the choice you wanna make but also make sure you are picking the right one.

All the decisions you make reflect back on you. So that's why having multiple opinions is good. You can really get into detail and think about each opinion really carefully to ensure yourself that the advice your are choosing to use is gonna help you be a better person, make your life easier, and hopefully help you make the best choices you can possibly make.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
48FB3005F4DC,"Have you ever been in a situation where you needed advice from someone to help make a decision but wanted to handle it on your own? If you have before,you shouldn't have had to go through that alone, nobody should, and here's why, making decisions is hard and sometimes you may choose a wrong one so you need someone by your side to help you make a better choice and be there for you. Seeking multiple opinions helps you make better outcomes by having another point of view on the situation, knowing what others would would do in your position, and having people tell you if it's a good decision or a bad one and helps you see the outcome of it.

In the first place, having another perspective on an issue helps you know what they think is best to do. When they give you a reason behind that choice, it helps you understand where they are coming from and realize the outcomes of them. If you ask people who have been in the same situation before, they can help you and tell you what the right thing to do would be. They can help walk you through it and make you feel a little bit better knowing you have someone who has been in the same shoes you are in now. Having another person tell you their thoughts and opinions might make you think of things you might have never thought about until hearing their points about it.

Another equally important reason is that when you know what others would do in your position it helps you know how they would handle it and let's you think more clearly about it. When others tell you what they would do, it may help you realize that they made a better choice and you should follow it. If your friends tell you about why they chose that, it makes you think more clearly about what to do and how to chose the right choice. Asking them questions that you may have been thinking of but don't know what to do helps you understand more and helps you figure out what to do. Seeking multiple opinions about something to make a better choice and hearing what others have to say really helps you understand everything better.

Finally, having people tell you if it's a wise or unwise choice and telling you what could happen as an end result makes the stress ease off a little. When people tell you if it's a smart thing to do or not makes the process a little better because you can think on how to make a better choice and not lean on making a bad one. If others help you realize the outcomes that may occur of the situation, it makes it better to pick which one you would rather have. Knowing all the end results that may occur and the things that may happen between helps making a decision easier. When you have people who are honest about things and doesn't hold back on telling you if it's a good choice are good people to talk to when decision making.

As can be seen, asking for advice on things to multiple people is always a good thing to do. It's always good to have multiple opinions when making a choice and helps you make a better one. Having people by your side helps you and let's you have someone else's opinion on the situation, know what others would do in your place, and let's people tell you if it's a wise or unwise choice and the outcomes of them. Having people by your side and helping you in times of need helps make the situation better. People voicing their opinion out to you helps you to have other ideas and things in your mind to think about when making a better decision. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
E46E59D6FAAC,"When asking for advice, people sometimes ask more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Why is it better to get multiple opinions, and how can that help someone make a better choice. I think it's important to ask for multiple opinions because the person you ask could be giving you the wrong advise so instead of asking one person who could be giving you wrong advise you could ask multiple people for different advise. When getting multiple opinions you can choose the one you so you'll be happy with how you fixed it. If you just ask yourself what to do then you could mess things up. Having a few more opinions could tell you what to do.

Even if you dont see it now it matters who you ask. Ask wise people, people u trust for advise. Especially people who you know that have been in a similar position as you. For sure dont ask people that you know might not give you a good answer. Its not bad to try and ask but not everyone has the correct solution.

Solve your problem the best way you can with opinions from the people you've asked. When you have more than one opinion then you have choice. Obviously its better to get the best solution but pick the advise that you like the most because if you dont then you could something wrong or you would probably be annoyed about how you should have picked someone else's advice. A good idea on how to get advise is to search the internet. The internet is filled with people who have experienced situations.

Your opinion could be wrong, so always ask others. Following just your opinion could lead you in the wrong way which is why its important to ask others for advise. What you want to do shouldn't be what you should do. Even if you think your opinion is right you should ask others just to sure.

In conclusion, you should do ask more than one person for advise so that you can solve your problem the best way possible, pay attention to who I ask, and not only listen to your own opinion. Thats why I think its important to ask more than one person for advice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
9FF4F0CFFA6D,"Advice is something we all need at some point, ether it's for something to buy or for making a difficult decision. So let's see the things advice is most useful for. Because, advice is most useful when you least expect it.

One thing advice is useful for is making a difficult decision. An example would be, making a choice that will impact you and everyone around you, it could impact you for the worst so some advice wouldn't hurt. Another would be, deciding what to spend your free time doing, because you could end up doing some thing that would be unentertaining.

The second thing is buying stuff. Advice is really helpful for making sure you don't purchase something you won't be happy with. An example would be a video game, you don't want to end up buying one you won't enjoy, so getting other opinions is extremely helpful. Another would be a book, although you mainly find books that you will most likely enjoy, there are going to be books that you will need more opinions to find out if you will enjoy it.

So, advice is useful for making difficult decisions so you don't end up making a horrible mistake, and for buying stuff so you won't end up getting something you won't enjoy. So, next time your going to do something, make sure you get someone else's opinion so won't make a mistake. Because, advice is extremely helpful when you least expect it.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
5EE37CF33717,"There is always a time where you need advice for something like a project or something important and you get confused and need help and ask someone for help and they might not know a lot about what you need help in so you ask more people for help and finally get what you need help in and I think asking for more than one persons advice can be helpful because everyone can know what you need help in and can share their opinion,get help by researching with someone,and asking for help by a teacher or parent.

my first reason why multiple opinions is helpful is when you are having struggles in something like in classes or class work time and are confused in how to answer or how to find the answer to a question or something else, one thing I would do if I was confused is ask the people in my table and they could give suggestions or share their advice about my question and what i'm confused about. Also when I need help I would also try telling the people in my table what I know about my question and they could say something about that and that would help me much better.

my second reason why multiple opinions is helpful is when your assigned a project and are in groups and your have to answer the questions and sometimes I would get confused with the questions I don't know and one thing I always ask is what to do and how to find the answers and my partner would sometimes show me where to look in the textbooks and what sites to use to find the answers and that helps me because when I get confused in something most of the time for me reading it or searching it up would help me understand better.

my third reason why multiple opinions is helpful is when I have to do work at home my parent could see i'm struggling and offer advice in my problems and that would help me but if i'm still confused I would go to my teacher who gave me the work and say I couldn't understand what you were asking for and the teacher can show me how to find the answers and tell me I should try using my notes and writing down every way to solve that question or more.

In conclusion about asking multiple people for their opinion what I though about asking more than one person for their opinion or advice is that would help a lot and can get you to learn from that by trying what you've learned from their advice and opinions. Also I recommend that most people who have troubles with things at school they should ask the people around them and use what you have.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
A2386ED7E56F,"When somebody commonly ask for advice the person ask more than one person because. They ask more than one person because they want to see if the advice there getting is true and if there getting lied to or not receiving the right type of information. They want to know if they should go on of what they have been told. I understand that if you are doubting someone. Also if you want to see if all of it makes sense its not that they do not trust you its that you dont trust yourself. It is known to ask different people for advice i do it and so do you.

Whenever you have a problem you think that you should go to an adult right? Well in my opinion no because we kids believe it or not have understand and better at giving advice in my opinion. Kids understand because we will likely 8/10 have gone through it. We should all ask different people for advice so you know how to approach a situation. There is always people that can help you exactly people your age. I think people at the 14-19 life stand could understand you more than an 35-50 year old could.

How you approach a situation in advice matter. First you have to find a couple true companionship. Second you want to sit them down and have a real conversation about how life is going. Then you go to the issue on had and discuss the matter on hand. Last you add up all the evidence then you decide on what you want to do. Then you make a decision on hand and handle the issue.

You are gonna have to tell an adult eventually and tell them whats going on but not at the moment when you have to come to a desiton of what you are going to do. they can move at there on pace when the person is ready to handle the issue it will be resolved. The person will have its on mind of state to do what they think is right tell they tell or keep it to themselves. I think all in the end it is there disesion and they handle it the way they think it should be handle in a pelote Demeter. Also they are aloud to go along the day and life with out the negeitive energy.

Lets go lets say Generic_Name and his friends Generic_Name and Generic_Name go to the park. Generic_Name had noticed somthing in a van a werid looking felow ask him for candy what will he do? I would say that before you go to an adult you ask Generic_Name what to do then you ask Generic_Name. If there awnser is go to an adult dont do it immidily at least go think it over yourself then if it fells right to you, you may take action on the plan so yes i think you should ask for advice with other pepole.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
C8F378A4AC05,"When facing a challenge or problem, people often ask someone for advice and guidance. But it is important to got to many people instead of just one. Asking a variety of people gives different perspectives, a multitude of different ideas, and many people have life experiences with these issues. Just one person will not have the same answer to the question as another, and it is important to hear advice from everyone you can to gain a proper understanding. Without a multitude of answers, your advice may be untrue or biased and therefore useless to you.

Everyone has a different point of view on the world. They have different backgrounds and experiences from you and others. To get an unbiased solution to your problem, you must ask different people what they think of it. Without a different perspective you may have a one-sided approach to the question and not answer or solve it properly. When people with different perspectives give you advice it will broaden your understanding of the challenge and your answer will not be as corrupt.

People often have different ideas than one another. Some are just more creative than others, and have a greater imagination when searching for a solution. For example, when a bridge collapses many people will tell you to make the supports larger so the bridge could support more weight. But more creative individuals may say to try a new approach with a different design that may make the bridge stronger and more cost effective. Not asking a variety of people for their ideas can prevent you from finding a better solution. That would limit the potential for what you could create and could be harmful to your career.

Finally, people tend to have different experiences in life. They could have more general knowledge about a topic, or even have expertise in the field. Asking an uneducated person for advice would not give you the same results as someone who is an expert. There could even be someone who has gone through the same problem as you. Asking them how they tried to fix the problem may spark ideas in your head. It is always beneficial to ask someone who is educated for their advice, because that will give a better understanding of the subject at hand and allow you to solve the problem to your best ability.

Still, many people just go to one person for advice; someone they trust will give them good advice. That may help, but it will never be as effective as asking multiple people for guidance. They could have a different point of view, different creative outlooks, and knowledge of things you may not know about. So I implore you that the next time you need advice, go ask as many people as you can. That will boost your chances of success and start a healthy habit you will need for the rest of your life.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
F9877560A95C,"Has asking other people for advice worked out for you? IÃÂ´ve seen many great outcomes of people taking advice from others, but some people still question it. From my own personal experience people have taken my advice, and things would work out for me if I took theirs. Asking multiple people for advice can help, because they can give you a new perspective of the problem, and you can listen to each opinion and choose the best one for your solution.

Imagine if you switched bodies with somebody for a day. WouldnÃÂ´t you be curious as to how they live your life.

Hearing a different perspective of the story may solve your problem. You could tell your friend about an argument you had and ask what you should do about it. They might give you new ideas or parts of the story that you didnÃÂ´t even think about. Their ideas and opinions on the situation could be the answer that you need. There might be parts of the issue that you looked over or didnÃÂ´t see where you were in the wrong for what you did. That new perspective can give you a huge realization towards everything and it can give you a new perspective as well.

Usually people donÃÂ´t want to hear other peopleÃÂ´s opinions, but this may be the one time that they do. Listening to each of those solutions and opinions from different people will probably help the most. Out of all of the opinions you might hear, you know which one is best for you. This way you have multiple options and can probably see how they would end. I also think that peopleÃÂ´s answers to your situation may be different based on what you are to them. For example, what if you asked your best friend, your mom, and your grandma for advice on whether or not you should go to the mall. Your friend tell you that you should go so that you guys can hang out. Your mom would tell you to go but after you finish your chores and your grandma would probably say yes because you need to live life to the fullest. All advice may be great, but itÃÂ´s still based on your decision and what you choose to do.

In my opinion, some of the best advice I have gotten has been from other people and I think that theyÃÂ´ve really helped me make good decisions in life. Not saying that it would work out for everyone but just saying it has been helpful. In conclusion, advice you get from others may be some of the best advice that you will get, but it depends on if you choose to use take it or not.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
4791C7D8BB6B,"Have you ever had to make such a hard choice that you stress for hours over it because you dont want to make the wrong choice? Well I know I have many times. In life,everyone must make hard choices, having others help you make that choice will lead to a successful and smarter choices, then making a choice on your own. Some reasons why seeking multiple opinions is best is because everyone has different views on things, my experience with my own choices in life, and the effect on making good choices is good. Dont you want to make the best choice possible? Well, the only way to do that is by getting other people opinions on your descion you have to make.

One of the most important reasons why seeking others opinions or advice when making good descions is that everyone has different views. Every person has lived a different life with different experiences and lessons and everyone thinks differently. Every person on this earth is different, no one is the same person. That is what makes this world we live in so special. Asking a person who is older and wiser may be better then asking a kid for advice. The older person has lived longer and has more experience with life, they can probably help you more and give you advice u can use to make your descion. Children have not lived as long and are less experienced, they might have a brighter mind but doesnt have nearly as much knowledge. Therefore, since everyone is different, everyone will have something different to say, make you think differently, and have different perspectives on the descion.

One of the many hard choices I had to make was just recently, I had to choose if I wanted to stay on my house soccer team or play on a travel soccer team. It was very hard for me to decide what I wanted to do, but it was easier to decide when I talked to my dad and a couple friends. I wanted to stay on my rec team because all of my friends were on it and I had many memories on that team. However, I wanted to play on the travel team because it is a more advanced soccer team. I needed to challenge myself and get better so I can play on the high school team. My dad helped me list the pros and cons of both teams which gave me a better perspective on the choice. My friend Generic_Name gave me details on the travel team so I knew if I chose that team, what it would be like. Lastly, My friend Generic_Name had also made a very similar descion, so she told me how she made her descion and said ""it may be hard to leave my friends but making myself a better soccer player is more important"". Talking to others really helped influence my descion and open up how I looked at the choice, I ended up joining the travel team.

The last reason why getting others opinions is good when descion making is, after getting everyone's views you are more experienced,smarter,and a better person then you were before asking them. With my own experiences, when asking others for advice, they teach me life lessons and give me powerful messages to use not only when I make my choice but in life in general. Getting views from others and even just talking to others makes you a wiser and better person to be more successful in life. In your lifetime you do a lot of growing and being able to talk to others and listen to there advice makes you grow to be the best person you can be. After asking someone for advice on one descion, you can carry that advice for your next good choice you make in your life. One effect someone could have if they dont seek multiple opinions to make a good choice in life is, they will not be able to grow from others and it will be harder for them to grow on their own. This is because in life we need each other to be better people.

In conclusion, making choices in life will almost always turn out as a very good choice when seeking advice from people who are wise or important people in your life. This because there is a good effect on you as a person, everyone has different opinions,views,and life stories and from my own experience I agree with this statement. Life is about growing and being the best you can be so, learn from others mistakes and experiences. Now, you will never have to stress over making a bad choice, because all you need to do is ask others for their advice. So,the next time you make a descion, make sure to ask many people about their opinion on your choice, trust me, you wont regret it.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
D35AE4A7CE83,"Everyone has drama in their lives. Sometimes friends or family create problems, and other times it is caused by the environment around you. However, most people don't seek one person to help solve their troubles. Many people are usually involved in helping a person get through their dilemmas. While this may be true, not everyone is poised to help others in their time of need. Multiple people can lie about advice, help you see things in a new light, and be there for you when you need a shoulder to cry on.

Lying can be a huge part of life for people, and it is even common in some careers. However, when it comes to giving advice, people want to hear the honest truth. For example, nobody wants to find out that a friend has set them up for failure with false insight. Unfortunately, there are many negative minds out there, and people can have the power to manipulate others for fun. While this thought may seem troubling, it can be easily fixed. When someone questions multiple people, it is easy to find out who's advice benefits them and who's does not. This is because they can talk to others about the advice previously given to them. In this way, people can debate whether or not another's advice was helpful or not. Another reason why people seek more than one person, is because they may not feel comfortable telling the truth about what really happened. Everyone has embarrassing secrets, and most people are not willing to tell people about them. For this reason, the person who needs advice may not always be satisfied by what others tell them. Sometimes, all listeners need is a full disclosure from the speaker to give out the best advice.

Aside from giving truthful responses, different people can offer different perspectives. Problem solvers often need to look at issues with a fresh mind, or in this case another pair of eyes. A variety of people have the ability to share multiple ideas regarding the speaker's issue. This can cause the speaker to think differently about their dilemma, and view things in other ways. As a result of having a different perspective, the speaker can also plug in new evidence for both sides of the story. Often allowing the speaker to sympathize with the other side of the disagreement or problem. In addition, everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. Speaking to multiple people allows the speaker to discuss creatively with the different skill sets of the people listening. Shortly put, a variety of people can contribute by simply offering their point of view.

Arguably the biggest reason why people ask large amounts of people for advice, is to feel supported. Even though some people claim to seek advice, it is not always about finding wisdom to solve their problems. Some people love the attention that drama brings, and they want to keep the spotlight on them while it lasts. They make their rounds by complaining to everyone and wishing that things could change, but do nothing about it. Attention is what they seek, and that's why they ask an abundance of people to help them. In other circumstances, the support people desire isn't the dramatic type. These type of people genuinely want to discover if people care about them, and they want to feel loved. It brings comfort to them knowing that a lot of people take time out of their day to listen to what they have to say. On the other hand, the last reason is because the speaker does not want to trouble the same person with the same dilemma. Trying to be considerate, they realize there is not much else a single person can say. In these ways, all of these different types of people seek the support that others gain when asking for help.

In the end, people ask many others for advice to try and make better choices. Sometimes they do their best to seek truthful answers that help to guide their decision making. Other times, people want different perspectives, and they end up discovering unique ways of thinking. Finally, some people want to feel like they matter. Ending up creating a huge deal out of their tiny issues. Anyone has the ability to make wise decisions based on facts and evidence. However, almost everyone turns to their loved ones to try and creatively find the wisdom they need.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

Seeking Multiple Opinions on a Problem

Have you ever had a problem where you sought advise from someone else? When people have a problem often times they will ask multiple people to help them make the best choice. Asking multiple people about a problem allows you to hear multiple perspectives, since different people have had different life experiences. Usually when you are involved in a difficult situation your judgment might be clouded, asking someone outside of the issue gives you an unbiased answer. The people close to you have your best interests at heart, so when you ask them for help they are going to offer good advise. Everyone gets into situations where they do not know what to do, so when they get into those situations, they should ask the advise from multiple people around them.

Different people have been through many different things, so when you ask multiple people for advise they can offer different views and opinions. A new outlook on a problem might be just what you need to figure out the answer. For example, if you were trying to decide whether or not to get a pet, asking someone who has pets or works with animals, would give different advise and opinions than someone who doesn't like animals. Multiple opinions give us multiple ways to look at a problem, giving us multiple ways to solve that problem. Asking the opinions of multiple people, who have different things to offer, lets you look at a situation in a new way.

If you are involved in a problem that means a lot to you, the stress and intensity of the issue can cloud your judgment. Trying to solve a problem when you can't think straight sets you up for making a poor choice, that's why you should ask people who are not involved. People who aren't involved with the problem you are dealing with can offer opinions that you could not think of before. When couples are having a hard time and can't work it out, they sometimes go to a couples therapist, the therapist can offer them help and advise the couple couldn't have found on their own. Being part of a fight or arguments can make people want to act without thinking, that is why asking the opinions of people who are not involved can give you an unbiased opinion.

Your friends and family want you to be happy, because they have your best interests at heart. The people you surround yourself with care about you and want you to make good choices. When you ask loved ones their advise you know their response is genuine, and it's what they think will help you be the pest person possible. If you are having a hard time or just need help with something, family and friends will be there to give you advise that a stranger could never offer, because your loved ones know you. Asking family and friends their opinion on a problem will allow you to make the best choice, because the people you choose to surround yourself with only want you to be happy.

Everyone gets into problems or situations they can't face on their own, that's why asking for advise from others will give you the tools needed to make the best possible choice. Asking the advice of multiple people makes it possible for you to get the perspectives of multiple people, and those perspectives will all come with their own advise to help you. Being a part of something that matters you can make you act rash or make decisions you would always make, that's why you should ask people who are unbiased, because they will give opinions that are genuine. The people around you, who care about you, will always give you advise and opinions to help you because they know and care about you. Asking for opinions from others is something everyone does, it helps us make more informed decisions and choices about our lives.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
319B2511943D,"Have you ever thought your choice wasn't the best? Not feeling like your did the right thing can cause a lot of anxiety. So, a way to release yourself from that endless regret is asking for other people's opinions. Asking other people for their opinion can help you make a better decision because others can point out certain things you missed and it causes you less anxiety.

To begin, people think differently, so they can point out things you may have missed. They can prove a point that you didn't even know existed in the situation. For example, if I was stuck trying to figure out if I should get the gray or white sweatpants for when I go horseback riding. So, I ask a friend which color I should get, and they point out that the white sweatpants would probably get dirty and disgusting, so I should just get the gray ones instead. Right there is a prime example of something I didn't even think about and in the end they ended up helping me make the right decision.

Lastly, it causes less anxiety for you to feel like you made absolute best decision. Feeling like you've made the wrong decision can cause a lot of stress and anxiety for a person. Almost enough to swallow you whole! That's why asking for another opinion is beneficial for you and your anxiety. Having a second opinion really does help!

In conclusion, seeking other people's opinions help big time in the long run. Asking for others opinions release a lot of weight off your shoulders. Multiple opinions help someone make a better choice because it causes less anxiety and other people can point out somethings you didn't notice. So next time your in a slump make sure to ask for another opinion.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
9D8BCE7B3C6B,"I didn't know what to do. My gut was telling me one thing and brain was telling me the opposite. After talking to my mom, my dad, and my aunt, for advice, I was able the best choice based on the advice given to my by all three of them. I think that talking to multiple people for advice is better then talking to one person because they can help you understand all the pros and cons, they all have different view points on a situation, and one person doesn't know everything.

Firstly, talking to multiple people can help you better understand the pros and cons of a situation. Pros and cons are the positive and negative outcomes of a situation. Understanding the pros and cons of a situation will help you make the best choice. Therefore talking to multiple people will help you visualize all the pros and cons in a situation. One person might help you understand the pros. They can help you make a choice based on the positive outcome. Another person might help you understand the cons, and help you make a choice based on the negative outcome. I think that talking to multiple people can help you decide because they can advise you to make the best choices based on the pros and cons each person has about the situation.

Another reason I think talking to multiple people will help make the best choice, is because each person has different view points. Whether the views are political or just because of age, each person's views are valuable in the difficult situation. For example, one person might be older and more wise, therefore giving you advice that is well thought out. Another person might be younger and not have as many experiences as the older person but they will probably understand the situation because they grew up in this day and age. Talking to both young and old people, or people with different views, can help you get a lot of different view points so you can make the best choice possible.

Lastly, talking to more than one person for advice will help you because one person doesn't know everything. One person might give you a little bit of advice and then the next person adds on to that. For example, if one person is telling you to do one thing, but they don't fully know the situation it might not be helpful. Another person who knows the whole situation can add on to what the other person said, and you will understand the situation better. This will help you make the best choice possible by having multiple people's input or advice on an idea. If you talk to several people, you will be able to get lots more advice that you wouldn't be able to get if you only talk to one person.

In conclusion, I think that talking to multiple people for advice is better then talking to one person because they can help you understand all the pros and cons, they all have different view points on a situation, and one person doesn't know everything. Talking to several people helped me and I know that from now on I will always ask multiple people when I need advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
2922D6AF678F,"Talking to multiple people gives you many points of view . Sometimes you dont see what you are doing that is wrong so asking people is better because when its about yourself you only see your point. Getting advice can sometimes be good and bad but mostly good, it can help you figure out what you should and shouldnt do. Getting advice can only help you.

For example, one day i was upset and no one knew why only my sister and my best friend i wanted to tell my mom but i didnt know how to tell her. So i had a talk with my best friend and she gave me advice on how i should say it. But if i would of did it before it would of been bad if i didnt know how to say it i a claim way but talking to my best friend helped a lot.

Then, after i got all my advice and was calm i went to my mom and told her how i felt. She was happy i came to her and told her everything in a good tone. I told her i had got advice before i told her and she was happy i took the time to pull it together first. My mom said ""thanks for telling me everything"".

Sometimes you have to go and get advice even when you dont want to it will help. It can always help you in the end. We dont really see any wrongs in what we do. But from other people they can tell you what your doing right or wrong and that helps.

The conclusion is that it is good to take other peoples advice because it can always help you when you need something. Taking others advice has helped me a lot it helps get things out and how to say things in a good way with out coming off wrong .",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
9222915C4C76,"Remember when as a child, you would go to one parent to ask them for a toy you really wanted? Or maybe another slice of cake? However, if they said no, you'd most likely go to the next parent or adult in the house, the more lenient one. Hoping for a response you'd want. If instead of your parents yelling at you for going behind their back and asking again, maybe they should be influenced by you. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person for a different response. Having different opinions, from people who think differently, helps you to formulate an overall more thought out decision of your own. Whether you take your parents advice of not eating another slice of cake, or you don't. Seeking multiple opinions can help people to make wiser choices.

One reason gathering different opinions from people can help to make better choices is because it helps in you being less one-sided and more open to new opinions. An article by VAstories. com about a woman named Generic_Name who recently decided to move into Virginia states her story of how and why she decided to move and who influenced her decision. Generic_Name states, ""I used to live in Chicago, Illinois with my husband and 2 young boys. As a mom, I always thought keeping my children in one place was the best option for my kids. That way they wouldn't have to move around and lose their friends. I soon realized I was wrong."" She proceeds to talk about how she asked her boys whether they should move or not, and to her surprise they said yes. They were bored of the same town and would like to make new friends somewhere else. Generic_Name also asked her husband and he agreed that the kids should grow up in different place. Have the whole world be their home. If Generic_Name hadn't asked her family for their opinions, and kept the same idea in her head that its healthy to stay in one place. The Pickets might have never moved. Understanding other people's point of view on the situation can help you to see another solution, or problem, you might not have seen in the beginning.

A second reason formulating an opinion of your own from other people's experiences is important, is because you don't want to base all of your own thoughts off of only one person's story. When you communicate with a variety of people, you get to see different stories and not just the same opinion stated multiple times by the same group of people. An experiment conducted by Buzzfeednews. com on politics showed that more than 65% of participants changed their view on their personal best candidate after hearing stories and opinions from people who support different political parties. The experiment took 11 republicans and 11 democrats, put them in a room with cameras, and had them discuss their opinions on why they voted for who they did. There were some disagreements, and controversial topics discussed. However, in the end, most people were not completely set on just one party anymore. Understanding other people's views on this topic, whether you agree with them or not, not only helps in being more open-minded, but you also get to hear other people's stories and not base your thoughts all on one person, or a group of people's opinion.

I conclude, seeking multiple opinions from different people can help you to make more well thought out choices. This is because hearing different thoughts and opinions on a topic leads you to become less biased towards your side, and you get to base your decision on multiple different points of view.

If you agree with the points made in this essay, maybe next time you want to have another slice of cake and you ask your parents. Formulate your own decision based off of what they say. Not off what one parent says. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
3579E5EE4EC8,"When receiving advice, the response you get will be different from everyone. This is because everyone views things from a different standpoint. Some people think it's best to keep their not so positive opinions to themselves, while other are going to share everything with you. It's important to have both these kinds of people in your life, because they're both needed in different situations. Let's say, for instance, you get a new shirt that you absolutely love. You probably want to hear from your peers that it looks great on you. Now, let's say you are shopping and find shoes that you aren't too sure about. In this situation, you're probably wanting to hear from your more honest friend, who will truthfully tell you how they look. You also might want to hear from multiple people, because everyone has a different style and opinion.

The examples I listed previously were very simple. Sometimes when you are in need of advice, the scenario is slightly more difficult to deal with. A lot of people deal with drama between peers. When these things occur, it's very helpful to have multiple friends whom you can talk to. It's hard to solve a problem when it comes to people, because everyone has a different relationship with each other. If you have an issue with a friend and you only ask for advice from one person, you're only getting one side of the story. If you ask for advice from multiple people, you are going to get many different sides of the story. This is helpful because certain people may know things which you don't know. The way you view a person is probably different from the way your friend views a person and whether it's positive or negative it's important to listen to that opinion because they could effect your decision.

Another important detail is the age group you're talking to. If you're talking to your parents they might give you different advice then a friend might give you. Generally, parents will be a little more comforting and give you good advice about not worrying too much about it, while a friend might know more about the person whom you're having issues with and give you more advice on how to actually solve the problem. Both these opinions are great, but they're both different, which shows that it's important to have both these opinions rather than just one. It's also very important to have someone who will just listen to you, while others will do the talking while you listen to them. It's also a good idea to get advice from both males and females, because they tend to have different perspectives, which can be beneficial in certain situations.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions on a topic is always a good idea. Whether it's as simple as choosing an outfit, or as complicated as loosing a friend, theres always room for more advice. Receiving advice from many people is helpful in many ways and always works out better then getting advice from just one person. It can be hard to make decisions, but with others help it can be a lot more simple and your decision will probably end up being better than if you were to make it yourself.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
D33821E5CC1D,"Have you ever had a tricky question that needed answering, or didnt know what to do in a certain scenario. Well i have and i mean a lot.

Sometimes asking for help gives you the answer you where looking for or it just reassures you and make you feel better about your opinion. It could be a simple yes or no some people ask because it makes them feel better about the scenario, Others may use it just to have a back up answer, and sometimes people ask because they are not completely sure what to do and others opinions matter the most to them.

The first reason is because it makes them feel better. It makes them feel better because it makes them feel reassured about their answer. Some people need to be reassured because they ether have anxiety and dont want to make a big mistake where people would laugh and make fun of them. I know this because my sister has really bad anxiety and she needs me or my dad to reassure her all the time. A lot of people ask for reassurance they ask two pr more people just to see if they get multiple of the same answers and they use ether what ever one people said the most or the one they like best.

Have you ever needed a backup answer? Well if so then you can get a back up answer from a friend or two. A lot of people need back up answers in case something pops up. You might need a back up answer if your going out with a boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you make one wrong move with one of them then its over or it could start and argument. Thats one good reason you should always have a back up answer they help you out and lets say you forgot your work at home and its due that day now if you dont turn it in then you ether get a zero or a lower grade. some people ask their friends on what to say. all your have to do is change the wording or have a really good excuse.

I dont know about you but I get confused a lot and i mean a lot over the smallest things. It takes me forever to thing of something and sometimes I dont know what to do. When I dont know what to do I usually ask a friend or one of my brothers they can usually give me a pretty good answer on what to do. It could be on anything for example last weekend I had to ask my brothers what should I wear I had no idea what I should wear cause I was going out with friends but surly enough they helped me out by giving me ideas on what the weather was going to be and everything else. And that could be an example of getting confused and needing reassurance.

These are my reasons one why some people ask for advice and why they might talk to more than one person. It helps them feel better about the scenario. It lets them have a back up answer. And last but not least it sometimes people ask because they are not completely sure what to do and others opinions matter the most to them. And thats why people ask more than one person for advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
503CF32C50EF,"Imagine you need to get advice for an issue you have been dealing with recently. Should you ask your mother, who knows a lot about the topic, or your father, who knows very little about the topic. The advice you get from each is going to be different. When it comes to advice, talking to more than one person is useful for, listening to multiple viewpoints, getting multiple options, and having access to a lot of different information.

Listening to Multiple view points can impact your final decision a lot. first and foremost, you can come to your own conclusions. when hearing other sides of the story, you are allowed to come up with your own idea about the topic. secondly, you can gather a rough idea. with the newly acquired information, you can form your own idea of what you should do. Last but not least, you can alter the idea your originally had. the job of a view point is to give you new information to reshape your old idea. listening to the viewpoints of others can drastically change your idea.

Next, you will be given multiple options. one way of getting multiple options is getting multiple opinions. said opinions can help shape a new idea. next, everyone has equal judgment of a topic. every person is allowed to criticize or agree with the topic at hand. lastly, you will be given contrasting opinions. these contrasting opinions will allow you to see both sides of the views on this certain topic. when asking others for advice, you will be given multiple options.

Finally, talking with others helps you gather new information. First,you can learn new things. Talking with others allows you to learn about something you might have not know about. second, you can but more thought into your newly acquired information. researching of asking about the info can make sure that you retain it better. third, you can use the information to reevaluate your idea. if you had a incorrect idea originally then you can now change it to be correct. Talking with others can allow you to acquire a lot of new information.

6D6B05E5478D,"Generic_Name's stomach painfully ached, it rumbled with the anxiety that consumed her whole.

She felt cheeky butterflies weave and tumble inside her belly. She could almost feel her heart trying to escape through her rib cage

""What do I do! What do I do?""

She needed help, and she needed it fast. Who could she seek for guidance? Who would be willing to give her advice when she needed it the most?

""Don't sweat it, just ask Generic_Name out to the dance already before someone else does,"" Generic_Name's best friend, Generic_Name, quipped.

Generic_Name gulped, she had steadily developed a crush on the ebony-haired boy, although, she couldn't bring herself to confess. It was slowly killing her, draining her energy with every waking moment. There were times like these that came more often than not.

""I appreciate the help, I really do, but who else should I go to for advice?"" Generic_Name mumbled with her brows furrowed, a crease becoming more prominent on her forehead.

""You should ask your older sister, Generic_Name, she'll know what to do,"" Generic_Name chimed in again.

After a brief pause, Generic_Name spoke up, ""That's not a bad idea, per se, Generic_Name sure has knowledge when it comes to boys, I'll ask her what she thinks when I arrive home...""

With enough being said, the girls disbanded and parted ways off to their part of the neighborhood.

I believe that when asking for advice, one should talk to multiple people and seek their opinions in order to choose from more options, have faster decision-making skills, and make wiser decisions based on advice from people who have experienced what you're experiencing.

For starters, when you ask more than one person for advice you immediately have variety of options to choose from. Although, some options are better than others, it is more useful to have several scenarios in mind opposed to only one. It especially comes in handy to ask for advice from multiple people when a door closes, with multiple choices you can still open up other door. Everyone's advice is different in their own way too, with a vast amount of opinions you get answers that are out of the box and new. It is always good to be open-minded, and with all the advice that you ask for from you become a more open-minded person ready to take on challenges ahead. The more options, the more prepared you are.

My second reason as to why I believe that you should acquire advice from several people is the ability to make decisions faster. Not only does asking for multiple opinions make you more open-minded, ready, and come in useful, it also allows you to make decisions in less time. Think about it, you have less of a chance to miss your opportunity when you make those choices quickly. You will also become less indecisive in the future if plagued with the same problem. Lastly, to bring this point home, all this new knowledge you are receiving from sources that you asked, you can share with others who are facing the same dilemma. You will spend less time to helping out those who seek your advice if you have already conquered the same problem and figured out the solution in no time,

My third and final reason is that asking multiple people for advice allows you to make wise decisions from experienced individuals.

Who better to ask for any advice other than people who have gone through the situation you're currently going through? Asking people who have have experienced what you're going through allows you to avoid those foolish errors they might've committed when they were in you shoes. People who share their experiences with you can also detail what's to come in the future and how to cope with it. When they offer their advice to you they can also offer comfort and inform you on how to fix what mistakes you might've done.

""Should I ask him or should I not?"" Generic_Name whined.

Generic_Name grinned

Generic_Name knew what that meant, she had secretly hoped that Generic_Name would try to discourage her from asking Generic_Name out.

""Go for it, Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name replied, still beaming.

""...Should I really?"" Generic_Name questioned, although it seemed more like she was talking to herself rather than her sister.

""Of course! You shouldn't waste this opportunity, I didn't lose mine when I was your age. You even said that Generic_Name told you to ask him out. Just ask Generic_Name if he'd like to attend to the dance with you,"" Generic_Name rambled.

""You know what? Yeah... Yeah, I'll do it!""

Generic_Name didn't have to tell Generic_Name twice, she was off before her sister could open her mouth again.

After the end result, boy was she happy to got a second opinion on the matter.

I believe that when it comes to asking for advice, you should ask multiple people and seek their opinions in order to have more options, become faster at decision-making, and make wiser decisions based on advice from people who have experienced what you're experiencing.    ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
6AEE71815EF0,"Seeking multiple people for an opinion on something can be good for a multitude of different reasons. For example, if you only ask one person you only get one piece of input, so the decision won't be as well thought out as it would have been if you got another person's opinion, because you would have to think about all of them and decide. Another reason to get multiple opinions is because you will feel more comfortable knowing that you picked from more than one person's view point on the situation. Finally, getting more input just means that you are getting more information on what others think, because not all people think alike. These three points are all great reasons on why you should get more than one opinion when seeking advice.

One piece of input is not enough to make a decision. When seeking advise, you should not make a decision based on one person because you could jump to making a rash and bad choice, due to lack of knowlege or input. Someone might have given you bad information and you wouldn't know, because you only went to that one person. If you take the time to think about everyones view, you will eventually come to a decision you feel more comfortable with, which is my next point.

If you get more people to tell you what they think you should do, you will feel much more comfortable knowing that you got the input from many different people when it is time to decide what to do. If you only go to one person, you might have second thoughts about the decision or feel like you made the wrong one. If you go to multiple people, on the other hand, you will feel much better about it because you chose out of multiple opinions, so you will be more sure of choosing the right advice for the situation. For my final point, I will be talking about how getting more input is better than less.

Getting more advice and input on something is just better in general, especially when your having trouble coming up with a decision on your own. When you get more advice on something, you will become more knowlegable on the situation and feel better overall about it. Someone might be giving bad advice to you and talking to more people about it can help you make a much better decision. You can even use multiple people's advice to strengthen your choice, instead of only going with one.

I hope that after reading this you will start asking multiple people for advice instead of just one, because of the points I stated in this essay. First off, asking more than one person for advice will make your final decision more thought out and better than if you just got one. You will also be much more comfortable making a decision with more input because you will have gotten to pick out of multiple people's view points. Finally, getting more advice and input is just better in general because you are more knowlegable on the situation and will most likely feel better about making the choice than if you only asked one person. I hope that you take all of the points into consideration the next time you ask for advice on anything.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
864EE35A4744,"My parents have always told me, whenever I have a problem, to come to them for help. They say that they are always there for me. It is really nice to have people to go to whenever I need advice about something. I have lots of friends, too. But they all aren't the same person.

That being said, they're all going to have different opinions.

It is always good to go to different people about what to do in a situation, because some people may have dealt with the same sort of situation you have, it is always good to have different selections on how to handle things, and different people could teach you different things about how to react in different situations, even if you don't take their advice.

A lot of the time, people don't going around randomly sharing their past stories without any context. But if you ask them, they could open up to you and share. This really could help you with situations you're dealing with. You get to see the second hand experience of what could end up happening to you. This could potentially being very eye-opening and make you change what you originally thought about the situation.

It is always good to have choices. I know when I look on a restaurant menu and see only 2 options of food, I wouldn't be very happy. This is another reason why you should listen to other peoples opinions. They could give you different options on how to handle things. Like they say, the more, the merrier.

You could learn things when people are giving you advice, even if you don't take it. For example, some one could be giving you advice on the sport you play. They could be telling you on how to handle different plays. You may think that the way they say to play the game doesn't really fit for you, but now you have more knowledge about the sport you play, which could benefit your skills in the game. This can apply for other situations, too.

So in the end, it's always good to have an open mind and listen to other peoples advice. You could learn more about someone, get different options, and even learn things. No matter how the situation ends up playing out, you ended making tighter bonds with the people who gave you advice, and that's what's important in the end.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

First off, when creating art, its important to get advice from others, but the more you get, the more clearer and more diverse it becomes. They can tell you if you messed up and why. They can give you ideas to make characters to fill in the gaps, They can also help expand the story.

Second off, If you want to seem as appealing as possible, you should ask people for what they want and work with them. If you want your work to succeed you must work with others so you both get what you want. appealing to peoples opinions also helps your work by showing that you care. everyone has different opinions, one person might like one thing while everyone else hates it. appeal to the bigger opinion.

Lastly, the more opinions you have, the more messages your art will have. One person isnt enough to give enough opinions. instead of just one opinion, you should have multible opinions so you can give your art a message. listening and getting feedback from multible sources will help you and your art in conclusion, three good reasons why to get multible opinions is; making it more appealing to a general audience, fill in gaps, and get feedback.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

Then you should try asking multiple people for their view on the situation don't believe me i might just change your mind. Now you wouldn't want to go in blind and get smashed with a metaphorical boat load of work because you didnt ask people what was going on or what was happening because you were uninformed.

One example would be going to a new restaurant that is new in town were the service is OK but not the best and the food is horrid all because you didnt check the reviews. You could have avoided wasting your time by just checking the reviews and taking other peoples opinion on the restaurant but you didnt and now you see the importance of others opinions. also another example would be advisers such as school advisers or presidential advisers they both have the same job and that is to give you their opinion.

Now you might be wondering well how will this change the outcome of anything let me tell you that it can change the way you think and also your view of the situation. Also the way it can change your view is almost like chess you have to be thinking like the opponent to understand what they are going to do next and also from their point of view were they can see something you can not see. Another example would be buying something like a game or a movie you want to get your moneys worth so you ask for peoples opinions to see witch one is better.

Everyone makes choices some big some small and some that are so big that you cant decide all by your self and you want to have the best possible outcome you can possibly get. and that is why you should always take other peoples opinions into account because no matter how much you care in the end they will all matter.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

First reason is they still need advice someone told them advice but still don't understand and need more explanation and more of a simple way of being said. Maybe that first advice wasnt good enough and need more advice becuase they want something that is easier for tthem to understand. Maybe the person getting the advice doesn't know that something means and needs to know what it means.

Second reason is they probly need advise for a problem that they might have. They probly ask more than 1 person becuase they want to see what different answer they can get. They also may becuase they might have a problem going on and don't know what to do and ask for help and advice. They also may be in a serious siuwation and need advice badly to make their next more.

Last reason will be that they probly need advice to get better at something they want to do better or get better at. They also may want to get better at play games and want to become better so they might ask a couple of people for advice. They also might want to get better at drawing ask their friends that know how to draw for a little advice. They also want to get better at cooking so they ask their mom for help and advice.

People should take more than one persons advice to make the best choices in their everyday lives. This can help people in many ways by seeing other peoples perspectives on their choices,or problems they are having making that choice. If someone only ask one person for advice this can impact peoples decisions in a positive way,but also negative way. Seeking multiple opinions for advice can help someone make better choices,because getting someone elses point of view can help you make better decisions,and they can identify who has the best advice for their choices in life.

When people ask for advice,people usually ask more than of person,because some of their choices that they want advice on may be risky to make and others may be less of a risk to make.

This is to say asking multiple people for advice can be beneficial in peoples lives, so that they make the best choices to progress in their lives. Instead of just asking one person which may lead to making their worse choice. which is why asking multiple people for advice is always the best way to go.

Further more, when you ask multiple people for advice instead of just one person. You have a better perspective on what choices you should make,and which ones not to, but if you only pick one person to give you advice it can also be a disaster. For example,last summer my sister and I had a choice either we go to bush gardens or the beach with my aunt. I asked only my mom which one we should go to the beach or bush gardens she told us to chose which ever one we like best so we went to the beach, but since my aunt planed it last minute it turned into a disaster. Also if people only ask one person it may lead them to make the wrong choices like I did, because they are only getting one persons point of view on their choices that they are about to make,but you can always learn form your mistakes and avoid it next time. Thus this is why people should always ask for more than one persons advice to make their best decisions.

To conclude,when having multiple peoples advice people should pick which ever advice is the best,or combine all their point of views on that choice if they have ever experienced that same problem to make the best choice. You should always ask more than one person that you trust for advice because it makes your life more simple. Asking one person for advice can be great if they know how to give you advice,but it can also lead to down fall which is why most people choose to talk to more than one person for advice. So that they can come up with the best choice to make. People may have a difficult time on what advice they should take and which advice they should not take. I believe that people should go with the advice that sounds best to them and not to think about their choices constantly.     ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Whether it's asking advice from your grandpa, mom or brother, as a human, none of us are perfect and we need to receive advice from someone.

Seeking advice from one person is great, but have you ever thought about why people ask more than one person for advice?

Asking for more than one persons advice is not only helpful, but it will give you a more depth and clear mindset.

People's advice matters and I can say it makes an impact on my personal life, everyone is different and it can help you form an opinion.

Asking for multiple inputs for the topic of advice, hits very close to home for me.

After I moved from the United Kingdom to United States of America.

I was sad and had the feeling of anxiety of talking to and meeting new people as I had made so many friends in the UK and no one in America wanted to talk to be or be my friend.

I felt like I wasn't meant to be in this world, but then my dad took me into our formal dining room and sat me down.

I talked to him about the whole situation and told him about my worries and asked him for advice.

He gave me advice on how to cope and to deal with situation.

I had suddenly felt a lot better.

I then started to be more open about my feelings and talked to multiple people like my school consular, mom, brother and even a classmate.

Now I have a lot of friends that I can rely and depend on because of the advice I took from multiple people.

Therefore, asking for advice from more than one person can change or have a huge impact on someones life.

Getting advice from multiple people is helpful in the decision making process for a better decision.

The more people that give advice, the better your decision will be.

When asking multiple people for advice or anything, the person is forming a better decision or result whereas asking advice from one person, the person is only listening to one opinion and it is not as good or reliable.

Listening to more than one person for advice will help the person form a plan that they could use for not only for one specific situation but multiple events.

If multiple inputs are given to you on a specific topic, you can use the skills and tactics that the person learned from the people who gave them advice to apply while making a decision of when and how to satisfy the problem.

Multiple people giving advice can help the person form an opinion on a topic.

For example, if the person is asking for advice on politics from an elder or several other people, by listening to them, the person can form a valid or personal opinion that he or she likes.

Therefore, getting advice from multiple people can help you make a decision a proper and valid decision.

Everyone is different and different advice can help you become a better human being.

When asking multiple people for advice, you have to keep in mind everyone is different.

For example, when asking your mom, dad, brother or grandpa for their advice on politics, they are all going to have different opinions and answers, and it's the job of the person to make and pick a decision that they personally agree with.

Multiple peoples opinion on something will help the person form a different perspective of a topic.

For example, several people giving the person advice on a topic of something like depression will help them find a different perspective of the topic like the bright side of it or that some people aren't as fortunate.

Everyone is different and people have multiple opinions on a topic or situation which can help them find more than one solution in the decision making process when asking for advice.

For example, if a person has an opinion on a topic, asking multiple people for advice can help them form new and different ideas that they can use to help formulate multiple opinions to help them use in finding a solution for a problem.

Therefore, everyone is different, and when asking for advice, multiple or different views will strengthen your thought and help you think diversely.

In conclusion, when facing a problem that you want to solve and get rid of, ask more than one person for advice on how to get rid of it.

It is important to ask for multiple peoples advice because everyone is different, it can help you form a final decision or opinion and I can relate and confirm through a personal experience on why asking for multiple peoples advice is important.

Advice is something we all need, whether we are down or happy, it helps us relate and find a solution for everything.

Therefore, multiple peoples opinions will help us make a better choice.                        ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
C2DD2FAC6EA4,"Advice about receiving advice

Doing something one way and then realizing there was a great amount of other options is a very annoying (and unfortunately, very common) case. It's even more annoying when you don't realize what the other solution was because then you can never grow as a person. People should ask more than one person for advice when seeking it because not everything will work for everyone and it's always better to hear from different sources.

Not everything will work for everyone, as everybody has their own way of dealing with certain things. Say there's a student in algebra honors and they are studying for a test that is stressing them out very much. Now, this student has trouble paying attention in class, and as a result of that, they often don't have the best of notes. If the student's parent is giving them advice and the parent says to the student that they should check their notes, the student will most likely have to seek help elsewhere because that advice is not very good for them in particular.

It's always better to hear from different sources. There are lots of times when you need to seek multiple solutions. In science labs, multiple trials are required to find out if the initial hypothesis was correct. When writing about current events, one must gather information from different sources or they could be risking the possibility of being biased. It's no different when people are seeking advice from someone. If somebody receives advice from one person and they aren't happy with outcome of the advice they took, chances are they didn't hear from enough people and a different solution was just waiting for them to try it out.

At the end of the day, receiving advice from multiple people is the best thing to do because not everything will work for everyone and it is always better to hear from more than one source.                                                                                                                                                                                          ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
0756FE811833,"So would you rather be a person that only ask one person for an opinion or ask multiple people, but seeking multiple people opinions is better because seeking multiple opinions can help because when u ask different people for their opinion it probably makes them feel good about that someone cares about their opinion and the fact that u can make more friends by just asking a question and seeking more help can also improve your ability to talk to someone without being nervous.

And why is it good that u ask other people for their opinion is because it can help people feel good about theirselvs and what i mean by that is most of the time no one cares about your opinion or theres and asking them for their opinion can really impact their life a lot because you probably brighten their day by putting a smile on their face.

Another way it help is that it improves your ability to talk to other people, say if your shy and dont talk to nobody try going around asking people for their opinion on something and you ask how that can improve your ability to talk to people well it improves your ability to talk to people without being scared it really works because the more you do it the less afraid you are to talk to people.

And also asking for other people opinions can help you make friends because when you ask for their opinion they probably want to ask you a question or they probably was thinking about the same question you asked but didnt have anyone to ask because they dont have friends either and now yall are friends and more friends are better than one.

so thats why i think asking multiple people for their opinion is better than just asking one person because it can help you get friends, improve your ability to talk to people,and it makes them fool good about themselves.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
65E3280D899A,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes seek for more than one person because some people might have a better idea than others; usually the one's who are educated, or the people who have been through a lot. Most people seek for mostly older one's for advice because they might have more experience than most of the young ones; and this can have you someone much older than you, and that has been through your age give you advice. Seeking multiple opinions also gives you more ideas, so that you can evaluate all of them and see which ones have more meaning in them.

One day this boy named Generic_Name, was in his house playing video games in his bedroom. His mom came upstairs, and said, ""Get of the games and go help your brother with his homework!"" Generic_Name responded ""Fine mom."" Generic_Name walked downstairs and sat next to his brother on the couch where he was doing his homework. His brother asked Generic_Name ""what should I do when my teacher chooses me for the spelling bee that is coming up in one week."" Generic_Name responded ""you should'nt because you are not good at spelling."" Generic_Name's brother went downstairs and asked his mom. ""Mom, what do I do when my teacher chooses me for the spelling bee thats coming up in one week."" The mom replied, ""you should accept if you are confident in your ability to spell, and dont do it if you are not comfortable with spelling."" This is a story that I made, to show you that asking multiple people can get you somewhere in life, and it can lead you towards the right path. That is what Generic_Name's brother did, he asked Generic_Name for advice, and Generic_Name's advice was kinda sketchy, so he went and asked him mom for advice and that advice really motivated him.

This is a story that I made to show you the reasons we ask more than one person for advice. Generic_Name's brother asked Generic_Name for advice, and Generic_Name told him that he is not capable of succeeding in spelling, but when he asked his mom, the mom gave him way better advice than Generic_Name did because the mom is more educated, or has been through a lot. we have to get the advice from the educated, so that we can educate ourselves on the advice that we got. We also have to ask the people that have been through a lot because they can tell us their mistakes, and we can learn not to do those mistakes.

The reason we want ask older people for advice is, so that we can get the opinions from people that already went through our age, for example our parents are older than us, and they have already went through our age; they can also give pretty good advice. We also ask older people for advice so that we can get advice from the wise, which means that they have more experience than us, and they can give advice to us that we can never come up in our minds. Older people can sometimes give you bad advice, so you have to ask older people who are actually educated, or have been through a lot in their lives.

We ask many people for advice, so that we can take all the advice that was thrown at us, and we can go evaluate them. We also ask many people for advice, so that we can get different ideas of what people think, for example your trying out some clothing, and you ask your sister first, she said the it looks kind of too dark, but then you ask your brother, he gives you way better advice. The reason your brother gave you way better advice is because he is a male, and he knows if male clothing looks good or not on his brother, so you have to know who to ask first. We also ask multiple people for advice because you never know who can give you some crazy opinion that you have never thought before, and that just created you to an opening to something that might benefit you.

The day that Generic_Name told his brother that he could not succeed in life was the day he realized that he gave his brother really bad advice, and he did not motivate him to keep practicing his spelling, he told him that he would fail if he did the spelling bee. He went outside for fresh air, so that it could distract him from the terrible thing he did to his brother. When he looked at the sky, he saw no clouds, when he looked back down he saw someone charging at him with a terrified face, it was a girl. The girl said, ""There are bad people bullying my brother, what should i do?""

Generic_Name was thinking about telling her to bug of and to tell her to leave him alone, but he thought about what he did to his brother, and told himself that he cannot do the same mistake twice. Generic_Name said ""go tell a guardian, or your parents to help you out, or just get your bother and run away, and leave them alone. And so the girl took his brother and ran away; on that day he was proud of himself that he gave someone good advice, and since then he gave good advice all the time to other people.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

An good start is always there parents because there are your mother and father legally and you will always trust your parents. I believe strongly that asking more than one person for advice could help you in your lifetime eventually.

A more of an approve in advice in life is always asking for small advice. The advice can take you somewhere when you ask for advice you either ask for small or an agreement into when looking into advice. Advice can lead to disagreements or agreements. Most advice comes from a decision in the head due to if they wanted to do something an example rob a store. Most people will talk to people if thats a right choice or a bad choice. Or a agreement to break up with there girlfriend or not. Those people can help you make those decisions in life because your getting a better understatement to think about it and make your decision.

Advice can lead into a do or die situation. Not saying that a bad thing but advice can lead you to do or die. But those situation can cause you to go to more trusted people and asking them for advice. But some people say that asking strangers for advice is not a good idea because they will either give them bad advice or your talking to someone that is clueless on advice and you should trust only your self. But there are right but in a wrong way. Trusting yourself can lead into a worse situation to get your self out or a good way and if you cant make a decision you will have depression for the rest of your life. But asking people for advice make having a decision so much better in anyway for example you have three choices to make and you canÃÂ´t decide so let the public decide for you.

In conclusion asking people for advice can lead to good things depends on who your talking to. Asking your siblings for advice or youÃÂ´r friends or advice is a good way to leave a good mark in youÃÂ´r soul.

It could also come as a bad think. Lets say you are with a group of friends and the pull out a vape and they try to peer presser you into vape, that would not be a good time to listen to what your friends try to persuade you into doing something. Maybe you will have enough common since to no not to do it because there are many bad things that can happen to you.

When you gather information you want it to be correct. It is like if you are searching something up on Google or Yahoo.

9F79DB6DE57E,"Seeking multiple options could show someone a variety of things they could do. Instead of only seeing something one way, someone could be able to use many peoples opinions to form their own. People around us look at the choices we make and form opinions about us through those decisions. If we go around doing the first thing that comes to mind, people will see that, and think of us as irresponsible people.

The option that is available to someone at first may not always be the best, and it is good to take a step back to survey what multiple people say before you pursue a decision. A good analogy for this idea is someone surveying an island that they have just come across. They would need to get to a vantage point, then make a decision after seeing what they are dealing with on this new land that is unfamiliar to them. Any person who doesn't take a second to survey what they have to do is going to make a bad decision sooner or later in their life, so it is good to do so if a person wants to be successful.

Somebody giving you advice on something may not actually like you, and they might be trying to manipulate you. Fake friends could tell you to go somewhere with them because it will be fun, even if they know it's dangerous or not in your best interest. If you seek more advice from other individuals that may be looking out for your best interest then you will be able to make decisions easier. Seeking multiple people's opinions may help give you a better reputation, while keeping you safer because the decisions you make will most likely be influenced by at least one person looking out for you.

Not only is seeking advice from multiple people a good practice, but getting multiple peoples opinions on something or someone is also very helpful so that you do not judge someone or something off of one person's opinion on them. Someones opinion on something may come from a past experience with the subject, and that opinion may help you in understanding what kind of person somebody is. Or somebody could be feeding you lies about someone or something because of some sort of bias because of race, religion or anything like that.

In conclusion if you seek understanding by getting multiple peoples advice then you will be more likely to form a better decision and have better opinions about things all around you.

73FB23F4670B,"I know from personal exprience that asking for more than one person opinion is a great idea. Think about it, taking more than one person's advice is a really good idea since you get multiple opinions, and you can see which one people think you should do the the most. Multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by being able to compare opinions and consider more than one person's advice.

First and foremost my first point is that you can compare opinions with others. You can see if people have better or improved version of your idea. Take for example if you wanted to figure out what to buy at store but you only had ten dollars to spend, and can't decide what you want to buy. You go and ask people who you know, and one of your friends gives you a good idea and says to buy something worth five dollars save the rest instead of wasting all of it. This one example for this reason, however their are multiple different ways this could go and millions of different scenarios. Next you can see if you have good judgement. Say for example if you go to multiple people and whenever you guys compare ideas they tell you that's also a good idea. That mean you have good judgement since the people who you are comparing advice with think your idea is still good, and if people when you do exchange opinions say that your's is really good than you might as well have good judgement over those types of things. You can see if your opinions are similar. Say for example you want to go somewhere for vacation, so you decide to ask your friends where you should go. You vaguely have an idea of that you want to go to England but your not sure, so go out and ask friends for their opinions. Some of them tell you to go somewhere they is think is nice, while good portion of them tell what you where you thought about going. Since the people around you thought of the similar place you wanted to go you resolute yourself to go there. In that scenario it makes most sense to go since not only majority thought so, you were already thinking about going to there.

Now we have for my second point is that you consider more than one person opinion. You can think about what ideas make fo a better decision. Think about this, your given multiple opinions by your friends and family on what you want to do with your money you got for working during the summer. With only one person's advice you be left with that or yourself not giving yourself much choice apart from your own brain, but with multiple opinions you think about all of them and then come down to all good ones and consider each one instead of just a few. Then we have getting more than one opinion is overall a better idea. If I'm left one person's advice and I don't like it for whatever reason I either stuck with it or I'm left with whatever I can do, but if I have many different opinions I can find one I think is rather good, or in the slightest ok. Last you get a more diverse outlook. Now tell me something don't you find having more than one person give you their opinion is way more one sided than if you had got multiple to give you there opinion is very diverse and different in at least ine way. I know from other people's exprience it has.

So in conclusion multiple opininons can help someone make a better choice by being able to compare ideas and being able to consider more than one person's opinion. Comparing your ideas with someone else can help you see if someone might have better advice, or if they have similar ideas with you, all of this helping you to make a choice. While considering more one person's advice can help diversify outlook on what to choose, or even allowing you to get multiple opinions so that you have way more choice than if you had one.

5AFB5923E1DD,"When asking for advice, it is important to talk to multiple people so you can get different opinions. Getting different opinions helps the person make a wise choice, instead of making a rash decision and using only one person's opinion. Asking for advice is basically doing research, because for both you use multiple opinions, whether from people, websites, or books, to conduct smart research or to make a good decision. For example, if I was doing an essay for school, I would use multiple websites and many different books on my topic so that my essay would be factual and outstanding. If all of my information came from one source, my essay may not be as factual because I would not have any other source to compare it to. Doing research is similar to asking for advice because if I wanted to know what people thought about a certain restaurant, I would get multiple opinions by asking friends and reading reviews online.

Having multiple opinions makes the person more knowledgeable about what they are seeking advice for. For example if you were thinking about buying a hand soap, you would probably ask for advice before you bought the hand soap. If you asked a friend that had received a defected bottle, they may tell you that the product is terrible because of their experience with the product. But if you ask another friend who had a great experience with the hand soap, they will probably tell you how terrific the soap is and how beautiful it smelled. The person that had a bad experience will be biased to say that the product is bad, but the review is the opposite for the person that had a great experience with the hand soap.

I have personally made the mistake of not seeking advice from multiple people when I decided to buy a pair of shoes. I had asked a friend what his thoughts were on a pair of shoes and he said that they were great. I then asked him if I should wait to see if they go on sale, but he said the shoes were so amazing that I should buy a pair right away. So I bought the shoes at the store, and when we returned a week later, the shoes were discounted for 20%. If I had asked for multiple opinions on whether I should or shouldn't buy the pair of shoes I may have saved $15 that day. That event always reminds me to seek advice from many people to receive multiple viewpoints and make a wise decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

They would give you some sort of advice but it's not all the same sort of advice. When getting advice from different people they would tell you something they experienced or their biased on, but it would all give you some sort of idea.

Imagine you have a project to do about something, but you don't know anything about it. If you wanted to find out about you would go research. When you research you see all sorts of websites filled with information that you could use. When you open these websites you see that they don't all have the same type of information. When you keep reading these different websites you get an idea about what it's about. It's the same thing with finding advice. You don't get the same advice from everyone, but it gives you an idea which is the similarity with all the advice given to you.

People deal with all sorts of things. It could be a job they had, a problem they suffered from, a crime they made, a honorable thing they did to the community. People had experience all sorts of things. When seeking advice, people first think of the experiences they had with that sort of topic. Then they tell you something based on their experience like what would happen, and what the outcome of it would be. People would say all sorts of things based on their experience because it something they experienced. People could experience the same things but in different ways, which could create the idea of some sort of advice.

Everyone has something that they like, it could be some sort of food, video game, bored game, book, TV show, movie, and sport team. Peoples opinion would be either they do like it, or they don't like it. They are reasons do like certain things, and there are reasons people don't like certain things. People are just being biased on things. It's like when you get advice from multiple people. They would be biased on their advice that they give.

Seeking advice from multiple sources is a good way to get advice because different people might have a different point of view, they could have prior experiences, or they could be of older age. I believe that seeking multiple opinions could help you more than just one.

Asking different people for advice is a good thing to do because people have different points of view. All people think differently, so getting different sources of advice is a lot better than one source of advice. Different people have different mindsets so, lots of people have a very good and positive mindset and they are the people you want to listen to more. Some people also have a negative mindset and they might theink on the down side of things but, sometimes they could have really good advice on things. Lots of people have many different points of view on things.

When getting sources the best sources are the ones who have prior experience with what you are seeking advice for. If you decide to chose someone who has been through the same path, it would be a good idea to get advice from someone who chose the right thing to do in the position that you are in. It would also be a good idea to get advice from a source who chose the wrong path and have suffered the consequences and know how important it is for you to choose the good path. It would also be a good idea to get advice from a source who has done something similar to what you are looking for advice for, because they might have a little way to make it easier. Getting advice from people with prior experience is a very reliable way to make a good choice on things.

Going to talk to elders is a very good source for you to make a good choice. Elders will always have a few stories from what you need advice on. When they get to that age that their at, they will become very mature and wise about the topic. The thing about elders is that they will always know what the right decision is and know how to lead you there. Elders are a very reliable source to guide you to make the right choice.

Seeking opinions from various opinions is the best way to help you make better choices. Seeking advice from multiple sources is a good way to get advice because different people might have a different point of view, they could have prior experiences, or they could be of older age.

When I ask for advice I want to find a common idea throughout all the people I ask because that could a common and a better way to do the thing I am asking for. The opinion could be smarter and move thought out because people give different advice. When giving advice you tell them most of the time what you would do in there situation and based on your experiences that makes your answer. When you are getting opinions you can build trust with that because they can use there advice and it works they can now depend on your judgments on certain things or maybe everything depending on the person. In my experience when I use the advice that a person has given to me it helps form a bond because I know I can trust that person with there judgment on that certain subject. In conclusion when people ask for your advice, they will most of the time talk to another person about it also but they do it so they can get a better opinion because of people thinking of something you haven't,smarter or more efficient opinions,and can build trust with a person because they give you a better opinion.

When people ask for advice,they often talk to multiple people because everybody might have different ideas or opinions. When getting different ideas it can help you because you can see in a new and different perspective and a new outlook and there advice could mean something totally different then what you thought it meant. When I learned about a new perspective I looked at different things in two perspectives and now if people ask for advice then I become more versatile became of the depth I have in this area and I can look at it two ways. There is always another method and that is to combine both ideas and or opinions together to make one really good piece of advice. If I were to combine two ideas that are both good the opinions on it will not be the same as having one piece of good advice because of the value each one has and the importance that each one has and combining two good piece of opinions together they advice can give more help and is going to be a efficient and it will be better advice. When you start combining opinions together it starts to become a habit and it will be a good work habit because when you are working in groups you can get better feedback to the bettering of the group. When I started asking for different opinions in group work or group projects it helped me better than someone else just doing it for me then the group has different ideas thriving and making it a successful project or piece of work we are doing. In closing when people ask for opinions, they often talk to multiple people because they want different ideas and or opinions because they can get a new perspective,they can combine ideas,and they can create good working habits.

People think that just one person is enough to ask for advice but what if the advice is not good and it very one sided or a mediocre advice? If you ask for advice and the advice is not good then asking only one person is a lose-lose situation and then you start to lose trust in that person because of the failed advice and then something might happen since the advice has failed. If you ask multiple people what they say you can combine your's and there's and have a more than decent advice then have a set up to fail advice. If you are being lazy and only asking one person for advice it is more of a lose-lose situation then a win-win situation because of the failure that is awaiting you and even if the advice works it will not work as well as asking multiple people for the same advice. I have only asked one person for advice before and the advice ended up not working and then something bad happened after because of only asking one person and evidently I found out that asking more people is more efficient and better than asking only one. In summary when people act lazy and only ask one person instead of asking more there is more of a loss then gain and that is why asking the same question to multiple people are efficient.

I believe that you should ask multiple for advice before making your final answer. If you ask for advice you should ask multiple people because of the better opinions,the different ideas,and most of the time people will not be lazy about asking for advice. I believe that when asking for advice for multiple people it helps you understand in different ways and helps you grow on your way of thinking and in a way makes you more knowledgeable.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
2AF2200F56AC,"When seeking advice, many people refer to a variety of people with different perspectives. There are three reasons that would explain people's tendency to ask for multiple opinions before making a final decision. When we seek advice from more than one person, we do so because it shows us different viewpoints on a matter, provides us with more clarity of what we aspire to achieve, and we know that different people will give better advice in certain situations than in others and we shouldn't rely too heavily on any one person for a matter that they might not be familiar with.

First of all, the fact that no two people will provide the same opinion is inevitable given the fact that everyone comes from a different background and is taught to handle things differently than someone else. If one asked someone's advice and did not take the time to seek a variety of different opinions, they could not be certain that the advice they are being provided is right for their particular situation or that it is relevant. For example, if one broke their mother's favorite lamp and asked their best friend what they should tell their mother, that person is making the mistake of relying on only one person to give them advice in a matter that could need more than one opinion, like their sibling's or their father's. Based on that example, someone could be given bad advice by one person therefore risking making a wrong decision, but with more than one opinion, that person can increase their chances of making the decision that is right for them. Of course, there is also the matter of simplicity and liking. In these cases, asking advice from one person is not likely to provide us with the simple answer we're looking for. Furthermore, anyone seeking advice has a higher chance of being satisfied with their options and their outcome if they ask for more than one person's guidance.

Next, asking for multiple people's advice gives a clearer perspective on what one should aim to achieve or do. If someone asked their parents where they should go to college, they are likely to be given a biased opinion based on which school their parents attended or where they want to see their child go to school, but if this person asks their teachers for an unbiased opinion, they can get a clearer idea of what they could achieve. Advice from only one person could result in the person seeking it being confused or making the wrong choice because of having only listened to one person when others could provide simpler advice. In brief, the main issue with asking the opinion of one person is that the person in need of counsel would end up misunderstanding the person who provided advice or doing something that one told them to do, not to help them succeed, but for the other's own pleasure. So, to make the right decision, it is wise to ask more than one person for advice.

Lastly, seeking the opinion of someone trusted or believable in most cases is not always likely to provide the right advice in other circumstances. As in most cases, some people are better at some things than others. For this reason, relying on one person for everything comes with disadvantages. For example, one person could be amazing in English, but terrible in math. The same thing applies to seeking advice or opinion, like if one always asked their religion teacher what they should do because they trust them to give them moral advice, but then one day they came to ask them how they should study for their upcoming science test, and the religion teacher couldn't provide good advice because they studied to become a religion teacher, not a science teacher. For these reasons, one must be able to determine how the different people they know could help them (or not help them) based on their situation.

In conclusion, one has the best chance of reaching their goal if they refer to more than one person when seeking advice. The reasons that support this are that we can access a wider variety of opinions and viewpoints, can clearly understand what it is we are trying to obtain or achieve, and we can ask different people with different strong suits for the advice we need according to our circumstances.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0

A lot of people have different likes so they say yes that is a great place to go, but if you have more than one telling you it is great to shop there or stay there you have a better chance. If you have more than one telling you something you have a better chance.

If someone wants to go fishing, they will need to know the better bait and the best spot to go fishing at. If some one wants to go swimming, they will need to know where is the best place to go.

If someone needs advice on a pair of cloths they need more answers so they feel good. If someone likes a short they need to know if they look good in the short. If someone wants a pair of Wrangler jeans they need to know if they good jeans. If someone likes a pair of shoes they need to know if they are a good brand.

If someone is going out to eat, they will need good advice what to get and where to go. If you never had a type of food before. If someone is on vacation they need to know what is the best place to go. If someone has never had something new on a menu they will want to know if it is good or bad.

FA483ED371E7,"when getting advice i believe you should ask more then one person. Asking more then one person can really help you get a better opinion on what your asking or need advice on. A good reason to ask more then one person their opinion when asking for advice is maybe they know more then you, they could have a different opinion on your topic, and they could have more reasons then you on why you should do something one way or they other or agree or disagree with your topic.

Sometimes when taking advice you should ask someone older then you. Because they are older then you they could probably give you better reasons to make a better choice. Asking your parents for advice would be great because theyÃÂ´ve been your age before so they know how to act in the situation. Also asking your teachers would be a good group of people to ask for advice from because they are very smart and more educated then then you are

Asking more then one person on their opinion could be very helpful if you are doing research. Because if they have a different opinion it could possibly be better then your opinion and make more since. Or in some cases if you ask different people you could change their opinion to agree with you. Sometimes you can have the same opinion as someone but have different reasons to agree with the topic, so you could give them more reasons to make a better choice and they could give you better reasons to make a better choice.

With some cases people could agree with you but have better reasons then you on a topic. sharing your opinions with different people could make them agree more with your topic then they already do. If you are arguing one side of a opinion but donÃÂ´t have many reasons talking to more people could give you more and even better reasons to agree with one side of an argument or topic. But if you have the same reasons as them you could probably come up with better reasons to agree with one side of the topic that will encourage others to agree with your side.

I believe getting out in the world and putting your opinion out to others about a topic would help people agree with what you wanting advice on or agree with the topic you are agreeing with. Also asking for advice from people can help you get better reasons for people to agree with you. Plus if you ask for advice it can help you do thing the right way instead of the wrong way. For example if you are working on a car or building a house or even a school project advice can go a long way to help you because advice can teach you to do it the correct way or help you with something you messed up on. ThatÃÂ´s why advice is important to me and i believe it is a good thing. Do you think advice is good or bad?",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
41B983E1E1EE,"When have you needed advice for something and you didn't know what to do, did you go to just one person for advice or multiple people and how did it affect your outcome? Making the right decision can be really hard, and figuring out what you are going to say or do. It's scary knowing that the choice on what you are going to do might be a really big deal and it can impact your future. When you also decide what to do you can also regret it after because you felt like it was the wrong choice. So when asking for advice, it can be better asking multiple people because maybe someone had gone through the same experience as you are going through and also maybe someone is going through a similar situation now and maybe helping each other out through this will help each person make a better choice.

Maybe what you are going through now, someone else had gone through it. Maybe what they chose to do in the end was a good or bad decision. They could help you through what you should or shouldn't do on their past experiences with that issue. They could teach you stating how it specifically affected them on what they chose to say in the end. They also may tell you what the would have done differently in the end so what they chose would have had a better outcome or if they wouldn't have changed anything.

When asking someone else for advice, maybe someone is going through the same issue as you. Working together and talking to each other can be a really good thing and it can lead to a positive outcome. Looking at the pros and cons can lead to a better result to the both of you too. Seeing what you can do to help each other is a wonderful idea. Just basically making sure you guys are there for each other is a good thing and knowing that you have each others back.

8E98853DF374,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. In my opinion I think that it is best to ask for advice from not just one person. People ask for advice on many ideas, this is because they want to hear others opinions so they can make the better choice.

First, when people ask me for advice, I am very straight forward with the person, this is because I want them to hear my honest opinion so they can make the better choice. People normally ask someone they can trust because, people want a honest opinion. People normally ask for different opinions because the person wants their opinion and multiple opinions so they can make the better choice.

Nevertheless, in my opinion I believe it is best for someone to get multiple opinions because they want to hear about other people's opinions. For example,

Generic_Name asks Generic_Name if he likes her idea and Generic_Name gives his honest opinion, Generic_Name then is going to go to Generic_Name to hear her opinion. This is because everyone wants to hear one person's opinion, then they will go and hear someone else opinion, this is because they want to hear multiple opinions so they can make they better choice.

Lastly, in my opinion I think it is best for someone to hear multiple opinions because someone may not be sure about one opinion and another opinion so they would go to someone else and hear another opinion, after that they should be able to make the better choice. People may ask about if their appearance is good, if their grades are good in school, and where they should travel during the summer. When someone asks for advice the best thing to do is give them your honest opinion so they can make the better choice after hearing multiple opinions.

In conclusion, when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, this is because they want to hear multiple opinions so they can make the better choice. People can ask for multiple opinions this is because they want to make the best choice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
FACC93B5A80A,"Seeking others opinions is important so you can make a decision. Asking could get you out of trouble. You may even be able to get to know what decision you make before you come up to it. Even the smartest people in the world ask for others opinions of their work. Asking for others opinions is good for decisions, can make you a more responsible person, and help your choices in the future.

Decisions can be really hard and dangerous. For example, if someone tells you something bad for you is good, you should ask someone else if that person is telling the truth. If you're working on a project, and your pier tells you to do something, you should ask your teacher if that is right. Even the most powerful and smartest people have asked for other people's opinions. But choose wisely who you ask, because you want to go down the right path.

Asking for other peoples opinion can also make you more responsible. It shows you're really trying to make a decision. There are so many choices you have to make, and this is a good tool to help you. You have to put effort into it, and this shows. Responsibility is a great thing to have, and choices start with it.

E8247E1BBF06,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one, single person. In the past, I have asked more than one person what they think. Most people also ask more than one person for something as well. Seeking multiple opinions is good because you can get multiple opinions and compare them, and you can get multiple opinions for things people have experienced and haven't experienced.

The first reason people should ask for more than one opinion is they could get multiple opinions and compare them. It's sort of like taking a survey, but in this case you are surveying peoples opinion. You would take someones opinion then go to another person and get their opinion. You could do this with more than just one person. For example, if you are going to try a new food at a restaurant, you go either ask people in person what their opinion is or go online to the review section of the restaurant website or rating website. You would then take everyones opinion and see the pros and cons for the food you want to try. The pros and cons could be about one certain dish you might want to try or about the restaurant its self. This is how taking many different opinions is good for making a better choice.

The second reason you should take multiple opinions is you can get opinions from people who have done and haven't done whatever you are trying to get an opinion on. You could take someones opinion if they have done whatever you are getting an opinion for. They might have experienced it before, but you could also take someones opinion if they haven't tried it before but get their opinion on what they think of it. For example, if you want to try something like a new ride at an amusement park, you could ask someone who has already riden the ride and someone who hasn't. You would get the person who already rode the ride their opinion of what they thought of the ride when they rode it like did it have loopty-loops, if it is really fast, or if it a spinning ride. You would then get the person who hasn't tried it and see what they think from just seeing and hearing about the ride. You could then get the pros and cons of each and decide whether to go on it or not. For this reason, you should take more than just one opinion.

In conclusion, you should get more than just one opinion about making a better choice. You could get multiple opinions and compare them. You could also get them from people who have experienced whatever you are getting an opinion about and someone who hasn't done it. For these reasons, you should get more than just one opinion to make a choice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
8430D63288D2,"Have you ever had to make a big decision?

I definitely have had to.

It was very hard to make and throughout the process I had a hard time because I didn't know if I was making the right choice.

If I could go back now and make that decision again I would surely change some things.

Maybe I would take longer to consider my options and the consequences that go along with them.

Most of all, I would ask others opinions before choosing my final choice.

Asking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because everyone has different experiences, some you ask may not know, and there are many opinions on different topics.

My first reason is everyone has different experiences.

Nobody has been through the exact same thing you have been trough because it's impossible.

This means that we all have something different to offer.

Experiences with certain things may change opinions and influence us.

For example, if someone grew up in a Christian home, when they're grown, they are most likely going to stay Christian.

Overall, nobody is the same and everyone has different ways of doing things and we should respect that.

The next, or second reason is some you ask may not know.

Not everyone has the same knowledge and some may know things others don't.

When people ask these individuals about a skill they are not particularly great at, they tend to freeze up.

Either they do not know the answer or they're not one-hundred percent positive.

Most people wouldn't want to give out false information to someone so, iif they aren't sure, they would tell the person seeking advice.

Other reasons why people may not know is because they may have never been taught the information.

If we only ask one person and they don't know then that could impact the outcome and that is why it is important to ask multiple people.

Concluding that, we shouldn't just assume everyone knows what we are asking from them and we should accept it and find others to ask.

The third and final reason is there are many opinions on different topics.

Everyone has their own opinion which may or may not line up with someone else.

When asking for advice, beware of this and think things trough.

Seeing situations from different sides may also help you in coming to a conclusion by realizing what the other side is going to think.

No person is the same so everyone likes different things.

For example, someones favorite fruit is grapes but someone else's is bananas.

In the end, nobody is the same and we are not going to have the exact same opinions, things, and favorite ways to do or handle situations.

To sum it all up, when making decisions, do them smartly and ask others for advice before deciding because it will give a better idea of the topic.

Make sure it is realized that not everybody has been through the same stuff as others and have different stories to share.

Also keep in mind that some people know things more than others and some may not know at all so make sure you are getting valuable information and if not then you should ask others.

Lastly, remember everyone has their own opinions on different topics which may influence the final choice they would make.

In conclusion, it is better to get multiple opinions and see the scenario from many different points of view.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
3588380B5507,"My palms were sweaty. I felt my face getting hotter by the second. My throat was closing in. I could hardly breath! I was so embarrassed. I knew I needed to ask for my friends opinions on my dress for the dance. I believe that getting multiple opinions can be helpful, beneficial, and has the best outcomes.

I asked my friend for her opinion on my new dress. She said ""It looks amazing on you!""

I still didn't feel like I looked good in this dress. I kept asking more of my friends opinions on this dress. I got the same reaction as the first time. I was so confused. So, I thought I could ask my mother. My mother told me that ""The dress was making me look like a young lady,"" and then she started to cry. After what happened with my mother I decided to wear the dress to the school dance. It was very stress releaving to have more than just my opinion. That is why asking for multiple opinions is extremely helpful.

When I wore the dress to the dance I got a lot of compliments! At first I didn't see the beauty in myself. I was blinded by the pressures of middle school and trying to fit it. Over the years has broke down the confidence and self esteem I had when I was a child. When I was little I did not care what other peoples outfits looked like or what the latest fashion trend was. All I thought about was recess, play time, nap time, lunch time and snack time was. So, my friends and mothers opinions helped me see that I looked very flattering in this dress. If I didn't ask for their opinions, I would have put this dress back on its rack. In my case you could say that it was beneficial to ask for more than one opinion.

The night of the school dance was scary. I walked into a crowded room with loud music. As soon as I walked into the room everyone was staring at me, even the DJ had stopped playing the music. I was so terrified and perplexed! I was never used to get this much attention from my fellow peers. I was always the girl who sat in the back and I always just felt invisible. I could feel the tension in the room. All of the boys looking at me, and their girlfriend jealous of me getting their boyfriends attention. I just froze like a statue. I would not move. My friend kept trying to drag me to the dance floor but, I just stood in the same spot. I was still trying to comprehend what just happened. Then the music started to play again. After the tension had died down I went out and started to dance. Throughout the night of the dance I got a lot of compliments. My confidence and self esteem was at it's highest just like when I was little! I felt like invincible and that nothing could stop me! I can't believe that I was going to put the dress back! Thankfully, I asked for my friends and mothers opinions, and didn't put the dress away. So, I think that asking for multiple opinions has the best outcomes.

Due to asking for my friends and mothers opinions I have a higher self esteem and confidence in myself. I could not imagine what would have happened if I did not ask for more than one opinion. So, I conclude that getting multiple opinions is helpful, beneficial, and has the best outcomes. I hoped you enjoyed my paper. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5B222B47AA21,"Have you ever had to make a tough decision but you just couldn't because it was to hard? Sounds familiar right. Well you probably didn't have made that decision because you didn't have multiple viewpoints. Don't worry though. Many people struggle with the same thing. It's hard to make snap decisions if you don't have different viewpoints on it. Many people say that it's easier to make hard decisions with different viewpoints and, I agree. It's better to make a decision when you have multiple opinions because you can find new viewpoints, have an outsiders opinion and, you could discover relevant information about the topic that could persuade your decision.

When I make a decision I seek out others for their opinion. This has helped me with the decision making process and it can help you as well. Every single day you make decisions. These decisions effect your life. For example one time I had to choose between quitting lacrosse or quitting acting classes. I loved both activities and, it was hard to choose one or the other. So, I asked my mom and she gave me her opinion. This was very helpful because if I had made the decision on my own, I wouldn't have been able to find another viewpoint and the decision I made would've effected my life forever. The opinion my mom gave was to skip lacrosse practice one day a week for my acting classes. Acting was only one day a week and lacrosse was three days a week.

I liked this option. I wouldn't have discovered it if my mom hadn't given me her opinion. It's better to find new viewpoints because there may be other option that you hadn't thought of. This option could also effect your life. It's harder to see the other options you have if you don't seek multiple opinions.

Another reason you should seek other opinions is because it's good to have an outsiders opinion. Say your making a big decision. Maybe Its a personal one or one at school or work. The decisions we make today will effect others. Sometimes positively and sometimes negatively. If you have an outsiders opinion, most likely you will become more empathetic. In our brain we usually only think of our own opinion. Our viewpoint. But, there are two sides to every story. We often forget about our peers opinions when making a decision. Having an outsiders opinion can help you learn other peoples opinions and point of views on the situation and it can help you learn how your decision can effect others. Maybe their opinion can help ween you in a different direction.

Lastly, I think its a good idea to seek multiple opinions because you can learn new information that can effect your decision making. The other day I was watching a movie. The movie was about a court case in which jurors had to decide if a man was innocent or guilty. The trial gave a lot of useful information that was used in the decision making but, as they went deeper into the mystery, more information was brought to the table. At first twelve out of the thirteen men thought that the man was guilty but as more and more information was discovered by the man one man who though he was innocent, slowly the other jurors who once thought the man was guilty thought he was innocent. At the end of the movie the man was in fact innocent. If that one juror hadn't brought new information that was relevant to the case, they probably would've given the man a improper accusation. This is a great example of how having many opinions can bring relevant information to a decision.

In conclusion, I think it's better to seek multiple opinions. Some could say that it's not helpful because its your own decision and only you can make it but, I think its better to have other opinions because you can find new view points, you can have a outsiders opinion and you can discover more useful information that is relevant to the topic. So next time you try to make a tough decision, make sure to get multiple opinions. Having those opinions can help you be more empathetic, speed up your decision making, help ween you in a different direction and help you make a decision that you change you life for the better.  ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
7C7963A10D5E,"When you talk to someone and you ask them, ""do you have any advice on my SOL tomorrow,"" or, ""what is the best advice you have for my future decisions?"" Do they give you good or bad advice? Do they even give you helpful advice at all? I believe that listening to others can help you make good decisions, and here's three reasons why: getting their opinions, easier path, and better choices.

First things first, get their opinions. When you ask someone for their advice, ask yourself, did they go through the experience that I'm interested in. If not, I suggest to listen to their advice anyways. They could give you positive or negative info. about their experiences. Their opinions are important when it comes to asking and listening to their advice, so that it will give you the options to help you through your life, and take you on the easiest path.

Easy paths can help you pass. When getting advice, ask them if its easy or hard, or ask if it was harder than they expected. When they tell you their answers to your questions, it doesn't mean that it's easy or hard for you, and that you will expect the same way. That's not always the case; in fact, it could be really hard for you than the other because they've experienced it longer than you. They would usually give you advice that you yourself can handle pretty well, because they know that you are a beginner and that you don't know what to expect. It's always good to listen to more than one person, so you can not only take an easy path, but the best path as well.

They've experience their decisions they had before and then they give you the best option to take. They give you the most educated option, or if it'll help the person out. A good example about making the best choices is a job. You can ask if you will make descent amount of money, or if it'll help the family and be able to pay the bills of the household you live in. It's always important to ask questions, like why they'd choose their answer, about their decision. Make sure to ask more than one person because you will need multiple choices to choose from. Be sure that it will also help you out really well with your future.

Remember to ask yourself if they've given you good or bad advice, or even helpful advice at all. Always ask multiple people for their opinions, so that you can have multiple options, and choose the best choice for achieving your goal. Don't just ask your family, ask you friends and teachers. It doesn't hurt to try something you're not interested in and pick the best and easiest way. You can use the best and easiest path to get to where you wanted to be from the beginning. Just remember, I believe that listening to others can help you make good decisions in life, and that is my advice to you.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
587B9AD94902,"Asking only one person for advice is not going to get the advice that you are looking for because sometimes one persons opinion is not helpful. Because people have different thought's so the advice they give might be different than what you need. And some people ask more than one person because they want to know if its the right thing to do or not.

One persons opinion might not be helpful because it can be what they would do. And you may not be like the person who gave you the advice so it wont be helpful to you. Or the advice they give can be the opisite of what you asked. Some people are rude and wont help you so you dont want to follow help from people who are lying to you. So their opinions won't be helpful for you because it can be what they would do and the advice could be the opisite of what you need.

You also want to ask other people for advice because People have different thoughts so the advice they give will be different than what your thinking. One persons thoughts might not be what you want so you will probably need more peoples thoughts to back you up. People are different than you so asking more people can help you get what you need.

Sometimes people just ask other people because they want to know if its the right thing to do. You could get one persons opinion and be worryed if thats what you should do. Because it just sounds weird or its just not what you think is right. Two people could could say different things so you will want to ask more people to see if thats the right thing for you. Because what one of those people say might be the answer your looking for but the other person is your friend or someone you like a lot, so listning to them makes more sense.

In conclusion geting advice from more than one person looks pretty appropriate because 1-One persons opinion is probably not helpful 2-people have different thoughts so they will be different than what you need and 3-You want to know if its the right thing to do. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
CDBE82430B57,"When you need advice what do you do? Do you talk to someone? If so,is it good to ask someone or even multiple people? I think it is because you can find what is the best option,sometimes its good to express yourself,and if you tell someone they might tell more people and you will have really good options. So I belive its good to ask many people for advice.

My first reason is to find what option is the best. What I mean by this is,if you only talk to one person for advice then sometimes it can go bad because,their advice is not going to be the best choice and sometimes it can make things worse. So if you ask multiple people there is a chance you can find the best choice that can help you.

My second reason is, its good to express yourself. If you express yourself and ask for advice it will put less stress on you and you can focus on something else because its off your mind. It is also good for your mental heath and it can buil up your self confidence. It will make you more comfortable to talk about your issues and ask for more advice.

And now for my last reason;My last reason is if you ask more people for advice it can help you. It can help you because the people you asked for advice might ask or tell their friends and you will have more options. This reason tides in with my first reason because this reason can help you find the best option and thats what I talked about in my first reason.

In conclusion, I think it is good to ask more than one person for advice because you can find what is the best option,sometimes its good to express yourself,and if you tell someone they might tell more people and you might have really good options.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Next time, try to ask or talk to more people. But why getting more opinion is helpful for you? Getting multiple opinion can help you get a better idea, more choices to choose from, and help you make a good decision.

Asking for opinion can help you get a better idea. Imagine a time when you were writing an essay. You ask your mom to give you her opinion. But that didn't enough for your essay. Then, you ask your dad and your sister. Now, you have three opinion from different people. You can combine those opinion together to make it a better idea. Getting better idea will help for writing an essay.

BA615AAC44E7,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. First, contracting advice from multiple people could provide you different points of view, to make the best choice. Second, not everyone will have the same advice and some may be better than others. Lastly, you could benefit more from hearing the advice of others more than one person. Talking to other people is smarter and more beneficial.

Contracting advice from multiple people could provide you with different points of view. Every person in this world has different advice to offer. Therefor, listen to everyone's advice because it will only help you when it comes to making a choice. For example, if you are making a decision about what collage to attend, but you dont know what collages to start looking at. The best thing would to do would to get others advice and how they feel about that choice. Other people can impact your choice to give a different stand point for your decision.

Not everyone will have the same advice. Therefor, some may be better than other peoples advice. Hearing other peoples advice varies from a range of helpful to not as helpful. However, any advice given is beneficial because you are gaining information and knowledge that will makeup your choice. Also, getting advice from others could help you put together your information and use it when its needed. Any advice helps, if you are put in a bad situation someones advice may help you with that.

You could benefit more from hearing the advice of others more than one person because, one person will not always give you the best advice. One persons advice will eventually end up being bad advice. Where as, advice from multiple people would help you get the best advice, that advice would be much more beneficial than one persons advice in many ways. For example, going to a church group and sharing advice is a spectacular way to get the best advice to make the right choices. In my opinion listening to other peoples advice is one of my main keys to success.

In conclusion, seeking opinions can help make a better choice. Reason being, getting advice from others could provide different points of view to make the best choice. Second, not everyone will have the same advice and each persons advice could help you in different ways. Lastly, you could benefit more from hearing the advice of others more than one person because, one person will not always give you the best advice.

144E2BFD59A3,"Have you ever been in a situation where you dont have any idea what to do and you ask one of your friends for help? or did not tell anyone and it backfired? Asking a friend or a trusted adult for help is a good way to get advice, but what if their was a was to make it a amazing way to get advice, would you take it? People now and days dont take into consideration that they have so many people to talk to and share their opinions with. Seeking multiple opinions is a extraordinary was to get advice. Because some people know more about the topic than others, one persons point of view might be biased, and others could possibly have more wisdom than you.

First, some people know more about the topic than others. The more people you ask the more precise your answer will be. If you only ask one person for their opinion it is the only stand you will hear, but if you ask 3 or more people for their opinion you get to hear multiple people share their views about the topic. As well as that, If you ask people to give you their opinions and the people on one side of the argument gets three votes and the other side gets zero you should most likely go with the first choice. Most people agree with that topic, there is a Spanish proverb that states ""If three people call you a donkey you are probably a donkey,but you can change the way you act or in this case change the people you ask and you will not look like a donkey anymore, you might still be a donkey on the inside but on the outside you are not.""Furthermore, Other peoples experience might be better than yours, so if someone was in your situation before they will know what to do and help you. Because they know firsthand what it is to be in that situation. Some people might say that it will be hard to find someone who is in the same shoes as you. To that I would say their are more people than you think who have gone through what you have, but they may have not told many people yet. So when you have a situation, seeking others opinions is a great way to get multiple peoples advice.

Second, When seeking advice it is crucial that you make sure their or your points of view on the situation are not biased. As a example, If someone has a biased point of view on a topic they will only tell you what they think is right and not tell you the other side of the story,and you dont ask anyone else about your situation you only have that one biased piece of information. This could cause you to make the wrong decision, but if you ask multiple people for their advice you will get a clue as to who is actually right in the situation. Expanding on that,When asking for opinions on a topic make sure that you ask someone you trust or you know will give you the right answers for you personally. Some examples of people you could ask are your friends,family,doctor,coach,teacher,and many more. If you ask these people, you know that they will give you the best advise, Because they only want the best from you. In addition, If you have a biased point of view on a topic you need to let that go. Because, it will cloud your head and you will not be able to take in the advice people are giving you. This happens because if you think that your view is the best or superior to another and someone contradicts that, you will not take in the facts they are telling you. If you want to get multiple opinions from people make sure your mindset is not biased. So when finding opinions its essential to make sure that you dont go out and get biased information.

Third,When finding multiple opinions for advice it is very important that you ask someone with a lot of wisdom for advice on your topic. Adding on to that, someone who is older or who has been here longer might know more than a younger person with not as much experience dealing with the real world. A senior citizen might have some experience dealing with many situations that you are going thought. Because they already went thought the hardships of life and could help you out tremendously, but some people might not know the answer fully. They will give you all of the information they know, but you have to ask more people for advice in order to get your full answer. Consequently, Someone wiser will give you a more truthful and in depth answer, they know that there are both sides to every problem and will tell you the right one. Wise people are people who are not selfish, they just want to make life easier for you because they most likely experienced what you are experiencing now. Furthermore,Somebody who is smart might not be the best person to ask, sure they are smart but they have not gone thought the things wise and elderly people have experienced. You can be smart but you cant know everything. Sometimes you have to go and ask for advice. Many people ask one person who is wise or smart for advice, but you need to know that the more people you ask for advice the better. Because some people only have half the story to get the full advice and make the best decision possible you, you half to get multiple sources. I hear people say that you know whats best for your body and that might be true, but sometimes you have to accept the fact that other people have more wisdom or knowledge than your and they would know what the best course of action is. Also people who have already been in this situation know about it, and you need to ask them for advice, not just wing it and go with what your gut tells you.

Finally,To the question I had in the beginning""Have you ever been in a situation where you you dont have any idea what to do and you ask one of your friends for help?"" I would say yes but after I figured out that you need to get multiple peoples advice I would always ask 3 or more people to give me their opinion. Because people are better in one skill of life not in another, a Persons views are sometimes biased, and People have more wisdom than others. After this you need to learn to ask multiple people for advice in order to make better choices.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0

It's a good idea to seek advice from more than one person because, they may offer, clarity on the situation, they may give you support, and possible solutions to the problem you're facing.

Lot's of advice offers clarity. Receiving advice from multiple people can allow you to see the problem for what it is and help you better understand what may be the right choice. One friend may tell you that you look great in red, while several other people think otherwise. Asking what to say is most effective when done to multiple people as this lets you to see diffent perspectives, allowing you to choose what to say with a better understanding of the person. Things like asking someone out, helping a friend though something, or convincing someone to think something new is often difficult without the insight of others. It is for this reason that when I am unsure of what to say, I ask my friends what they think to get a grasp of what the peron I am talking to may be feeling. Getting advice from multiple people really hepls you understand what's going on.

People who give you advice may also provide you with support. Other than tell you how to do something, some people may just help you directly. This is good for a lot of things and helps you accomplish what you need. Advice is very helpful, but having someone root for you, or cheer you up is great as well. Asking dome how to deal with loss is more than just how to heal, it's an oppertunity to allow them to offer you emotional support. Having to study for tests was hard so I asked a friend for some tips, instead, she ended up practically tutoring me and helped me ace tests. I asked for advice, but got so much more.

More than one person giving you advice, gives you multiple possible solutions to solve a problem. When getting advice on something like art, it's best to ask more than one person because one person's style may not suit you while another's does. Getting help from only one person can limit the amount of possible solutions you get to a problem. It's a good idea for most things to ask advice from multiple people. Even doing puzzles becomes easier when you have multiple eyes on it. Same thing with videogames, you clear levels faster when you have multiple people thinking how to win. The quickest options sometimes come only after asking a plethra of people. If you've ever heard the term, ""Two heads are better than one"", this is probably what they they meant.

C4FC27B38A8F,"When it comes to seeking advice, most would go to more than one person lurking for answers. Searching for advice is a common thing in our life time, nothing to be embarrassed about. Gaining advice is an important thing in our life. It helps us all grow and understand the things we don't. Don't know something? Just Ask. There are major reasons for why people would seek out multiple people, one being to be able to listen to all perspectives, getting an all around better answer, and being able to understand the concept more clearly.

Listen to all of the answers in many different perspective is the most important attribute to getting advice. It would cause you hear out all sorts of opinions to see the view of all the people you asked. Gaining all of the knowledge will cause a bigger solution that would most likely end out in the way you'd like it to be. If you were to only listen to a single answer, you would only get that one and only opinion that could not work as well as you thought it would. Gaining knowledge of other's opinions are important, they're everywhere, in presidential election, government decisions, FCPS decisions, etc.

Adding to listening to multiple perspectives, You would be able to understand the concept you're looking for more clearly. The reason for that is because you're looking at a wide variety of answers rather than from one person. You'd get a broader knowledge of the subject, and you probably don't have to ask again. The information is likely more accurate since it came from multiple people. One single person could accidentally give you the wrong information causing a possible bad outcome. For example, there are many wars caused accidentally just because one person made a minor communication error.

When hearing out the advice, the larger solution will start slowly coming into mind. All the information that you've gathered from multiple perspective will all combine into a more suitable solution. That one solution will become bigger and bolder than the separate answers. It's like engineering, they discuss about each of their ideas, plan it all into one, then creating their first prototype.

In general, it's recommended you ask more than one person for advice for the most accurate answers to your desired questions, more broader information and solution. There's no downside for asking multiple people, all upsides for searching for advice. Just takes time.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
2B5011D4C860,"As we all know all of us need some advise at some point in our life. We ask for advise to get through rough times, bad situations, and even life itself. Three main reasons why we ask for advise is because we all have fights in friendships,get into bad relationships,and struggle in school.

First of all, we all have our fights with friends over periods of time. They can happen because both of you could like the same handsome and popular boy in school. Fights with your friends can even happen with liitle things like a disagreement and start to fight over that. It happens it's part of life. Another example is you not going to their birthday party last year and you both stop talking to each other. Make it up to her this year and try to plan to go to that brand new amusment or water park that just opened a few days ago.

Secondly, girls could get into bad relationships and not know what to do. To all of the girls out there we all get into bad relationships. I can tell you I have had many of them in my life. We all fall for that cute,pretty, and sinister smile on their face. I have seen it so many times it's unreal to belive that once we say yes we fall into their plan to take our hearts and just tear them to shreds. Boys can be like that. They plan to trap us and never let us go to see the bright beam of love again. Until you meet another one who is more caring and loving and you start to feel that sensation you used to feel and you know you found the right one.

Finally, we all struggle in school. It's like you try and it's not enough to power through the year you are there. I have been there so many times that I can't count. I struggled in math so much I wasn't passing in that class. It was so hard for me to where I had melt downs and called me stupid and dumb. I was at the point to where I wanted to just give up and quite everything I had done. My mom and dad on the other hand had my back and they still do to this day. They tell me that i'm not stupid and dumb and to just keep trying and to push on and to always look ahead and never look back.

To sum it up, all of us have our bad and good days and that's okay. We all find away to push forward and get through it together. As I said in the beginning we all ask for advise because we all have fights in friendships,get into bad relationships,and even struggle in school. All I have to say is don't stop trying if you don't make it try again and just don't stop fighting. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

EE1BD54150CC,"These are some good reasons why it is good to ask people for some advice! It is good to ask people their own advice because you can listen and hear from differnt point of views.

When you have other peoples point of view,you get a bigger picture of what you're doing and how do to it.

You get more of an understanding and a bigger and wider verity of choices to choose from.

People ask more than one person advice so they can understand it more and not only use their on own ideas but also listen to what other people have on their mind.

Its good to ask people what their idea is because sometimes your idea doesn't always work and you need a backup if it doesn't, you may also find it helpful to go online and search differnt type of ideas from around the world.

You can also find it helpfulto ask your parents,teachers,friends, and maybe some people you may not know.

Before you think of starting anything the best thing to do is ask questions,you can get alot more information out of it then you think. Plus other people may do the same and get lot of resources to choose from. It is possible to use your own ways of thinking,but after you ask for advice you need to plan out what and how you're gonna do with the information that you have gathered together. You may also want to do a rough draft or write on a piece paper before you ask for any advice,it may give you a better headstart then jumping straight to it and asking questions.

You could also make one of those Diagram so you can compare and see whats differnt from the advice that you have so you can see if its alot better. You have to ask yourself questions like, ""Does it make sense?,"" ""Does it have an meaning?,"" ""Does it have an main idea to it?,"" and ""Does it talk about what im typing/writing about?,""those are some simple questions you can always ask yourself before you start typing/writing. It is more simple then brain storming your own idea and trying to figure out alot of stuff by yourself,that'll take alot of time and it'll be more frustrating then usual,but all you have to do is ask a close by friend or family member what their idea on something would be. After you get all of your information and details about what you wanna type/write about to get now easily put it down on whatever paper or computer you're using at the moment,you will get it done faster,more neat,and more detailed then you would have if you wouldve thought of an idea by yourself.

B731B6D15B45,"Have you ever needed advise on something, how many people would you ask for help? While some people use one person to get advise others use more than one and maybe even up to four people. The viewpoints vary drastically with how many people you use to get help or advise, and that is why people either fail or succeed in important situations. When in important situations people have were there is not any room to fail you should go to multiple people for guidance. The first reason for that is that it will help to get different opinions on the topic you need help with. Second, often times the decision is hard to make on your own and other people could have knowledge of what your decision should end up being. Finally, the more people you ask the more your answer will be refined, for instance you could get a good answer from someone but another person could have pretty much the same answer but they refine it more to give you an even better outcome than you could've had without the other people.

You can get advise from more people to even out the opinions, and the more of those opinions you have the better your advise will be. From my experience people have very varied opinions on different topics, so if you have just one person the likelihood of you having a very one sided piece of advise is much greater than you asking more than just one person. Sorry to say but there are a lot of people with very one sided advise so you need to watch who you ask about advise, especially the important advise. This is why you should never just rely on yourself to make the important and hard decisions to make, you yourself can be very one sided and not even know it. There are many people in the world to ask, and everyone has a slightly different understanding of how things work and how they view everything on whole, so try your best to ask the most people you see to be a good amount to help your upcoming decisions.

You could have a very hard decision in your opinion, but after asking people you could find someone that knows exactly what you are doing and can give you the perfect answer. This is another reason why you should ask as many people as you can before coming to your final decision. For instance you could be working on some specific project that in your opinion is very challenging, but after you've been asking around for help enough you find someone who is very experienced in that line of work. You may not always find these people but asking enough people you will begin to find pieces of your answer, and if you get enough of those pieces you will finally get a good answer for your project. There was a time that I had a project in a class and it was very challenging to me so I went to my mom and dad first and they were very experienced in that background so they gave me a clear and easy answer to help me with that project. That is just one example of how asking more people can help you get better advise overall.

You could get what you think to be a great answer from someone, but you wisely decide to keep asking and find an even better and more refined answer for your decision. This is why you should keep asking people even if you think you have the best answer you should always keep asking until you are sure you have found the perfect answer. It's like making a puzzle, you keep getting getting little pieces of the puzzle and finally you complete it after you are done asking enough people. It is the best way to go about things and there is really no shortcuts, so try your best to get all the info you need to make the perfect decision.

When in important situations people have were there is not any room to fail you should go to multiple people for guidance. The first reason for that is that it will help to get different opinions on the topic you need help with. Second, often times the decision is hard to make on your own and other people could have knowledge of what your decision should end up being.

Is that really the best way to handle that situation? It is the worst way to react way to the problem other than just thinking about your own opinion. When making a choice, you should always seek many different people's opinions. Those people may have different points of view, may know something others don't know, or may have actually experienced what your facing. Therefore, never just seek one opinion, but seek many different ones.

Before you make a choice, always ask different people for their opinions because they may have different points of view. Let's say a new school is being made and they are trying to decide if they should force students to wear uniforms. The pricipal thinks that uniforms would be good in school because of the professionalism in the looks of the uniforms. The principal of the school asks many people's opinions on what he should do. The people he asked had different body sizes, such as big and small. Often, uniforms are made for a specific body size. The bigger people said they thought uniforms should not be required because the uniform was specifically made for slim or skinny people. Having small clothes that make you uncomfortable make it hard to concentrate to work. The smaller people said that uniforms should be required because when they attended school, the uniforms made them look good and work efficiently. Different points of view makes very different opinions.

Even if you think that you have made up your mind on what you want to do, always ask other's opinions because they may know something that you may not have actually known. For example, let's say Generic_Name just graduated high school and is looking for where he wants to go for college. He has his mind set for College A but wants to ask his family for their opinions. He thinks College A is great because there is a soccer team he can try out for and that he can get a schollarship. His family tells him that he is correct but College A doesn't have a good learning program. That means that he would have a problem later on about finding a job after college. His family then reccomend for him to go to College B because it is closer to home, has a good learning program, and has a soccer team. He didn't relize how good College B was and decided to apply for College B after the conversation with his family. You may think you know all the facts but always ask for other opinions because you might learn something.

Let's just say you and your family are trying to plan a trip but can't decide where to go. Asking different people's reccomendations will help a whole lot. The people you are asking most likely have experience with the place they suggested. For examle, if one person reccomended going to a beach, they would give different reasons to go to that beach. You could compare different people's opinions and reasons to make a final decision on where to go. Other people's experience will make your decision easier to make.

When it comes to decision making, people aren't always the best at it. Normally, the person just thinks of their own opinion and maybe one other and just goes with what they said. When trying to decide on something, always ask for different people's opinions. Opinions differ from point of view, weither you know something someone else doesn't, and by experience. Therefore, whenever you face a problem, never just seek one opinion, but seek many different ones.                 ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
034F335E1B82,"Often times when people need advice, they'll turn to the person they trust most. While this is a good way to get someone elses feedback on a topic, it is best that they turns to more than one person. Advice can have a great impact on the way things are handled and carried out. It often effects how something is done and how it turns out in the end. Therefore, it is important to receive more than one persons' advice because the person can learn from what others have done, have more of a variety of opinions to pick from, and make their own decisions in a situation.

To start off with, learning from what others have done in the past is important. When someone asks more than one person for their advice on a certain situation, they can hear about the different outcomes, such as what to do and what not to do. For an example, if someone was asked for advice about a dating problem, the person being asked, who has dated in the past, can give more precise and trustworthy advice than someone who has never dated before. Hearing more than one persons' opinion on a topic can surely make an outcome better if the right person is asked. It is important that the person looking for feedback knows who's had the same experience before so they can receive more proper feedback.

While an individual hears about what others have done, they can decide on what piece of advice they want to take. When the person hears about what others have done in the same situation they're in, they will hear all kinds of different solutions to the problem. While there will be advice that will be their first choice, there will be some feedback that may not even be overlooked. It's important for the person to hear more than one persons' advice if they dont agree with the one way of solving the issue they were told. Having a variety of options to pick from is a great way for the person to make their own decisions and solve the problem.

Speaking of deciding, having more than one persons' advice can let the individual decide on which piece they want to use in their problem. To explain it more in depth, going by only one person's opinion on the matter can lead to a horrible accident, especially if the person felt that the advice wasn't good to take in the first place. But if the person were to have several opinions to reference off of, then they could pick the advice they believed was most suitable for the situation and carry out with it, which could leads to a better resolution. Having options when it comes to advice is the best way to decide what is the better option for the situation. Being given the option to pick from several different pieces of feedback can lead the person to a better solution than some other advice.

Overall, the best option is to ask several people for feedback rather than one. Having multiple sources is often the best way to decide what to do and settle out a situation. Often enough, only receiving one persons' advice can actually make the situation worse than it was to begin with. So while taking one person's advice is good, having several opinions is better for the person. With the person learning for other peoples' mistakes, having a variety of feedback to pick from, and deciding how to figure out the problem, they are likely to settle out the issue without a hassle.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
EF0543C6FA6D,"Why is it impirtant to have multiple people give you advice? Some peple might need more than one persons edvice to get different perspectives. Other people might need multiple people so they can have back up with them about the situation. But everyone has their own opinion on situations. Or some people might really need some help with the situation. Finally lets talk about why i think these reasons.

First,I think the reason why some people might need multiple people for advice is because the are going to need different perspectives. Most people that think through things and brainstorm in their head what their going to do, They would most likely want other peoples opinions on it. Other people might have different perspectives about some things and they might want to hear what other people have to say about it. Strangers might be the best to talk to because of the opinion that different veriodes and catergories that people may have. There are different people in this world that people are gong to want to have cause of what they have to say about different catergories. Finally thats what i have to say about this first reason why i think people might want multiple people.

Second,Another reason why i think some people might want multiple people is because they might want back up to help with the situation. Now if their family is like my famile then thats great becuase my family likes to get in drama and likes to back me up when i need then. For some people they might need more than just their self to deal or go through the situation with. Now look im not saying to fo and fight and drag other people into the situaion im saying to just express whats happening. Thats the conclusion on my second reason.

Third,reason why i think people might want multiple people advice or some thing is beause they actualy might need help. Most people might just handle the situation way differently then others might. LIke i know if im in a situation im going to want multipe peoples advice to see what the best route to go on. Now some people might just go through that sage where they are just stuck in the moment and dosen't know how to get out. That is my third reason why i think some people might want multiple advice.

FInally thats all the reasons i think some people might want multiple peoples advice. For some people they might want other peoples opinions for them to choose which way they wanna go with the situation. Other people might just wanna be on their own with the situation. You just have to take your time and go dy by day. You should just try yur best and do what your heart desires to do.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
F0B1C389A815,"Have you ever needed some dire advice for something urgent and asked only one person and wondered why things went wrong. Asking one person is not safe. Some people could mislead you on accident or on purpose. In other cases some people are just not experienced in the situation. Well in these situations you should always ask multiple people.

More opinions give you more options to choose from. Having more options can help you come to the solutions to your problem much easier. You can pick the option that you are most comfortable with and sounds the best. Which also makes you more confident when going through with the advice and putting it to use.

Another bonus is that it makes sure you are not getting bad advice. Some people are just not experienced on some topics and Should not being giving you advise at all. So if you ask one person they are going to pretend like they are experienced because everyone wants to help a friend. Asking multiple people means you have the chance to be asking someone that knows a lot about what you need help with.

The last pro of asking multiple people is that they could all come to the same conclusion. If everyone comes to same conclusion or a majority of people that should be the advice you go with. If majority goes with this advice it is going to give you the best outcome. Also it is easier to decide when everyone is saying the same thing.

That is why when seeking advice you should always ask multiple people. More opinions are more options and it is the safer route in general. Some people could just give you terrible information or opinions and with a group they would fix that. Also when multiple people are saying one thing it should be majority rules. So always ask multiple people it could save you.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
471611351FAB,"When something bad happened's to you or a friend you would want to get help. If your sad then others would want to get help or make you feel batter about yourself. When ever i'm sad or mad I would turn to my mom or my best friend. I never just go to one of them because if one of them has a different answer then what I was hoping for then I may or may not go for that one. If I ended up getting myself into trouble I would ask my mom then a friend to see what they would do, then I would chose the one I liked the most and do that. Most people talk to others about their problems to get different feed back or to get another point of view.

A year ago my mom and dad wanted to split. I was super sad about it but I asked my friend to be their for me. I told her what was going on with my mom and dad and she said ""sometime adults aren't happy together so they go of on their own ways."" The next day my friend wasnt here but my other friend was so I talked to her about what was going on. My best friend had never had their parents split up but my other friends parents had split a little while ago. My friend had told me stuff about this and how I could help myself when I was sad. My best friend didn't know how to help me so I turned to my other friend and she helped me. I asked both friends for advise and they both gave me different answers so I got two different views.

When I found out my dog was pregnant I had no clue what to do so I turned to my teachers and asked for advise. One said to tell my mom and let her sit in a vet and sell the babies (I didn't like the idea), but the other teacher said to look it up on YouTube and give my dog a lot of attention. When I told my mom she said it was my choice so I has to pick something. I didnt like the first teachers advise so I did what the second teacher told me to do. So I look up how to take care of the dog and her soon to come puppies, but when the day came I called my friend to help me. She told me almost the something the second teacher told me to do, so thats what I did. For this, I wanted to have more people gave me advise because I didn't know what to do.

When I have a problem I like to turn to not only one person but two or three. Have someones advise is good but it may not before you. When I ask more people then I get different answers which to me means more choices.

I hate the feeling where their is only one way out so I like to help myself think ""well, she said to do this but I dont like that idea, but the other idea he gave me was more like if this happened, but the new kid told me to do this and I like that."" Right Their I have more then one choice to use. If you feel like something is a bad choice then dont do it, do whats best for you.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
A03F03805EF8,"Quick! you're late to a party that you had to bring the cake for but you can't decide on what cake you want you do like chocolate cake but you also want the one with fruits on it so you ask your friend for advice. people often ask others for there advice and opinion on a decision to help them make a better choice, can asking people for there opinion on a decision help make a better choice. Often people ask others opinion and advice on decision to see if they can make a good choice, everyone has probably done it, when you're at a bakery and can't decide what cake you want you would probably ask a friend for there opinion. There are many ways asking can be really useful for example having more than one opinion can probably tell you something that you didn't think of, it can lead to your choice being the best choice it can be, and it could make things easier

The first reason asking for others advice on a decision can help in your decision making is when you ask for someones opinion it can open new ideas that you didn't think of before. Bringing up new ideas can be super helpful its making your decision better. It can be really useful for buying something if you want to buy a toy but only have enough money for one thing and you ask someone for advice they mention things like how durable it is and how long they think you'll use it for, they bring up good points on what you should buy. Making a decision with peoples opinion and advice in mind can lead you to satisfy everyone that you asked having more than can point out things that are bad and point out the things that are good

Another reason is that hearing others opinion on the matter can bring your decision to be the right decision, like if your thinking of stealing a candy bar and you ask your friend if you should do it or not, usually you would do something that you friend says, stealing isnt the best option, so you leave the store without doing anything wrong, you could've stolen it but your friend didn't want that so you agree with them. Usually peoples opinion on something is biased so asking someone else is really good for changing your answer for the better. And if your buying food for someone that has an allergy and you ask your friend for advice for which one you should get and they mention that one of the things you were going to buy has something that is allergic to that friend ,you basically almost killed someone, and asking for someones advice helped you out. When making a choice you always want to pick the best choice and having more than one person making that choice can help a lot.

the finial reason for asking for advice or opinion from others is helpful is if you're having trouble with things like keeping organized you could always ask others for advice or if you are struggling with a math problem someone could help you do it in a different way then you did before. Its really useful to ask for advice from others to make whatever you are doing a lot easier than before we do it all the time.

Asking for advice on a decisions is really helpful having someone to point out something you didnt notice and making your choice the best choice it can be. In conclusion, yes it would be the best to ask someone on there opinion a choice that you are making you always want to make the best choice and asking others is the best way to do it. at the end of the day you pick the cake with fruit on it because your friend mentions that everyone at the party really dislikes chocolate, having a friend there saved you, you would've got kicked out of the party and without someone that knew that you would've had a bad time, so always ask if you can decide something, its the best choice to choose.      ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
16760A114ACB,"Need advice? People ask multiple people for their opinions because they may need more help, looking for a more mature idea or comparing the advice for a better idea of what they need.

People may ask for more advice because they need more help on decisions they are making or can't decide of what to do or say in the situation they are in. It all really depends on the situation and what they are going through to make the mature decision. Asking immature people isn't really a good idea in my opinion because they could get you in trouble or ending up not making the best decision. I think to make the best decisions is to ask advice from someone you trust and are really close to and they are mature enough to give you the best advice.

They may want to be the better person in the situation and be more mature and ask for more mature advice or thinking to seek a better decision, and a better choice depending on the situation they are going through or what they are deciding. I think that being the mature one and the better person is the best decision to make or do. If some people think that asking for multiple peoples advice is making them seem desperate or needy that is wrong because you need and should make the right choice for you..

People may compare advice given to them because they may like some of the advice they have been given so then they will combine some of it so they can make a good choice. Which I think is a good idea for people to use as long as they make a smart and good decision best for them. So, asking for multiple ideas and advice is a good thing to do because it gives you more help, you make a mature decision and you can compare and combine the advice and ideas you are given to make the better decision and it can make your life better in the end if you make a good and smart decision for you and your peers and you wont have any regrets... ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
DE84ECE816A7,"When people ask for different opinions, it is so they can see what peoples views are. People ask for advice all the time, but sticking to one persons views isnt always the best way to get the best information. This is why people ask for different views or opinions when seeking advice.

When going out for information, asking people is one of the best ways to get it. Instead of looking something up or searching in a book, we can ask our peers or anyone. The bad thing about this is everyone has opinions. Having your own opinion is very common but when it comes to ask someone about something their opinions may differ from others. Our opinion may be the opposite of theirs and we may not agree on it. Which is why asking for multiple opinions are important.

When talking to people they will give out their opinion. Their opinion is important because we can see why he or she thinks that way. With their opinion we can use that opinion and reasoning to better help us find better advice. Instead of talking to one person and getting a single opinion which may be biased.

95AAC538586F,"We make decisions everyday, whether its what to eat for breakfast or a bigger decision like asking somebody on a date. People often consult other people such as their friends, family, and trusted adults before making a decision on something. We do this because getting multiple opinions can help us make the right choice by giving us a broader perspective on the situation. Some people may be biased if the question at hand involves them too, which is why it is good to get advice from different people. If you decide to ask your closest friend and no one else for advice about something, you may not get the best information because that one person might not have all the details or knowledge about it. Overall asking multiple people for advice instead of just one can help you make a better choice.

Asking a single individual and nobody else can be a handicap because you wont have multiple inputs on the situation and you may be unable to make the best decision. According to a study 23% of people who ask one and only one person for advice end up making a decision they later regret. By asking multiple people you can get a variety of inputs that may help you to make the best choice or pick the best option given to you. There is a 27% chance that when asking five persons for advice on a topic or situation they will have had to make the same or similar choice, which in turn, can give you information on what or what not to do.

Having a few different points of view can aide in deciding the best way possible.

Bias is something that can affect a situation for the worse by giving an opinion that benefits one party or person in the situation. People may cover up or hide their bias to make it look like they are giving an answer from a neutral standpoint. When making a big decision in life it is important when getting advice to avoid getting a single biased answer by consulting more than one person. You may not realize it, but by only getting the opinions of people that you think will agree with you or give you the response you want is a biased way of getting advice, to help move away from that, try and get opinions from people that you are unsure of what their response will be. To make the best choice that is unbiased and overall a good decision asking more than one person is the best way.

Asking informed individuals is also very important when making decisions in life. Trying to get advice from someone that doesn't know much about the subject or situation is like asking an animal for directions. Without prior or current knowledge about the decision to be made the advice they may or may not give will be uninformed and unhelpful. Over 53% of people have had similar decisions they have had to make about any topic. By seeking multiple opinions you have a higher chance of getting advice from someone who experienced the same thing as you and had to make the same or similar decision. As a result of getting more than one opinion you can get the most informed advice to make the best decision possible.

Seeking more than one opinion can result in the best advice. You can broaden your perspective on the situation by getting differing points of view.

the possibility of biased advice is greatly lessened because you have different pieces of advice. Getting informed opinions is much easier as a result of getting many different opinions.

Decisions are made everyday, but to make the best ones we have to consult more than one person.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
9C20E2584A8B,"When we ask for advice, we ask people which are older than us. This is because they have gone through many difficult experiences and don't want us to go through the same experiences they did. It also helps us get different perspectives. For example, when we don't know what to get from Amazon, we ask our parents or any loved ones, to get their opinion. When we don't know a certain subject in school, we ask our siblings for their help, so they can teach us. Seeking multiple opinions from others is a great thing to do because it helps us get different perspectives, and can save us in school.

First of all, people ask others for their opinions, so they can get different viewpoints. Getting different viewpoints help's us make our decision faster. For example, if we don't know what shoe to get, we will ask our siblings or parents to see what they are thinking. From asking our loved ones, we get a different perspective, and this can help us make our decision faster. Getting others opinions can help us make a better decision.

Secondly, getting multiple opinions can save us in school. Some people may be struggling with a certain subject in school and might need help. Getting help from others in this situation can help us pass the class with an A. For example, when we need straight A's, we will ask our siblings, which already went through middle school. They will tell us a few tips and tricks which might save us a scholarship to college. Although one sibling might seem enough, we still need to ask others for their opinions because it might save us a lifetime career. Getting multiple opinions can save us.

C0611756DF81,"Have you ever needed advise but didn't know who to ask? You think about who to ask do you ask your uncle is it your grandpa teacher who? The answer is all of them it is much better to ask multiple peoples opinions than just one for multiple reasons. Keep reading because I'm going to explain them to you so that you can a better under standing of it.

The first reason is that you are you and not every one thinks the same way. By asking more people you will have a solution that works best for you. Remember that you don't have to take any one persons advise you can use the the advise given to you to form your own solution. Over all you get a more personalized response to your problems or question.

Another reason is that not every one has the experience and knowledge on your situation. Not everyone knows how to do it or what to do. If you ask your dad and he knows nothing about it you cant just give up. you have to ask multiple people someone will give an answer. However you cant stop there you need something that works for you and some body who might have more experience in that area of life and give something that works better for you.

Last but not least if you have a question and you ask more than person you are going to get a more valid response.

What do I mean I mean if the majority of people give one response it probably the correct answer. You dont to ask one person only to find out that they're wrong. I would also advise you to ask the person why they think what they think. asking more than one person will help you better stand the problem and by doing that we can narrow it down to give the most valid response.

Thats why its better to ask multiple people. You will have a valid and personalized response from people of all different backgrounds. So next time you need help finding a solution use this advise. If your sure that i'm right ask around they will tell you.                                   ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
179F54C0EE22,"Are seeking multiple opinions to help someone make a better decision helpful? Do they really restrain someone from making a terrible decision that cost them everything? Well, I know if I was stuck on making a really tough decision, I would turn to people I trust. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision because other people may be wiser, they may have been in the same situation, and they may have a different point of view on things. Sometimes, looking for other opinions can help somebody stay out of a detention center or jail. If most were stuck in a situation like that, they would turn to multiple opinions. Who would not?

My first reason for why I think that other opinions can help someone make a better decision is because the other people may be wiser. If a person has more knowledge, they can help make a better decision with a better outcome. that is like an Eagle teaching its babies how to hunt and track down food without dying. Other people also may make better choices, which then lead them to being successful and not get in trouble. This is my first reason for why I think that multiple opinions can help somebody.

My second reason for why I think seeking multiple opinions can help somebody is because they may have been in the same situation before. An example of this is widely used in schools across America and especially at my school. Students ask other students and friends questions different assignments. This can be good because if someone has already been through something, they are more capable of passing good information on to somebody else. And students are not the only group of people who use methods like these, it happens in everyday life. Online reviews of restaurants and stores is also a good example of how other opinions can help someone make a better decision. If a family was looking for a good place to eat because they were really hungry, they could look at the reviews and other people's opinions to help them make a better decision on where to spend their hard earned money. This is my second reason for why I think that finding multiple opinions help others make better decisions.

My third and final reason for why I think that seeking multiple opinions is helpful to somebody is because others may have a different point of view on things. It is always helpful to get an opinion through someone else's eyes. Some people's brains do not function the same and others may think differently than some. But what may seem stupid and wrong to some may sound fantastic and right to others. This is my final reason for why I think that seeking multiple opinions is helpful for making a better decision.

In conclusion, I feel like seeking multiple opinions from others is the best way to make a better decision. It is not mandatory that people ask for other's opinions to help make a better decision but it is very helpful and may have a better outcome. I think that every person should seek another's opinion, but they do not have to if they do not want to. Finding other's opinions can also help a lot of trouble makers in school, teens disobeying their parents, and adults making bad decisions that send them to jail. All in all, I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help somebody make a better decision",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

These studies are most effective when more opinions are collected from. In order to make major decisions, you must first ask the people involved. Seeking multiple opinions is a key part of collecting rich data.

The most effective way to collect data is by collecting the opinions of the ones involved. Rich data comes from the true opinion of the people. When I was in sixth grade, I did a survey on whether or not people should keep fields to farmers, or sell the land to businesses and urbanize the land. Starting out with only my families opinion was not only just a bad idea, but jeopardized the surveys reality. After seeking multiple opinions, I have seen the value of when more people are involved.

Today, petitions are used to persuade ideas for rules or laws in society. The more people on the list, the more likely the petition will be considered. Multiple opinions have a leading role in persuasion. Seventh grade taught me a valuable lesson when I decided to create a petition on banning a specific math program called IXL from my school lessons. This petition started out with only a few people but it changed heavily when I asked many more people. More people wanted to join this petition I had created after viewing the stunning amount of signatures added. The shocking amount of people added to one side of the argument caused them to jump onto the bandwagon too. I knew the average number of people on one side after considering some offsets in which I concluded was driven by bandwagons. If one side of an argument has more people, that argument will become more popular among moderates. Multiple opinions help fianl decisions when acknowledging bandwagons.

While most situations are best for all opinions, some data is best collected from just a designated group of people. For example, an election for the Senate seat representing Virginia is best decided for residents of Virginia. It would be nonsensical for a resident of another state to vote in this example. The people involved in this should be considered into the data. A right choice for a decision comes from the people that are affected and involved.

As long as it might take to gather, more opinions matter. Multiple opinions matter because it show the true opinion of the ones involved and affected. Bandwagons must be considered into data because some will choose the side most picked. Choosing the best choice is interrupted by bandwagons that should be acknowledged into a final choice. When collecting data, make sure to collect from only those involved and effected by the decision. Seeking multiple opinions is a key part of collecting rich data.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
A3F2C4FFA504,"""Will you go to prom with me!"" Generic_Name popped the question. ""Let me think about it,"" Generic_Name blurted out the words and ran away. Later that evening Generic_Name called her best friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name belted out, ""Guess what, Generic_Name asked me to go to prom with him!"" Generic_Name's smile dropped down to a frown. Generic_Name paused for a few seconds and then replied,""Generic_Name, you know I've liked Generic_Name for three years, besides he only asked you because he was dared to."" Generic_Name's excited expression faded, ""I guess you're right, I'll decline his offer."" Later that month Generic_Name was getting ready to go to prom solo when she heard a knock on the door. She stared out the window, what she saw was truly unexpected. Generic_Name was standing on her front porch in sweatpants and a sweatshirt, it looked as if the homecoming king was not attending the most important dance of the year. Generic_Name slowly open the door; she was waiting on Generic_Name to say something. ""Why did you say no?""Generic_Name threw up his words as if they had a bitter taste. Generic_Name only said what she could, the truth, ""Generic_Name said you had just asked me because of a dare."" Generic_Name cried out,""Don't listen to Generic_Name, I had been waiting for months to take you to prom and you declined only because you asked for advice from someone who is terribly biased."" Generic_Name felt like she was to blame,""I'm so sorry, I should've asked advice from someone else."" This story may have been fictional, but terrible misunderstandings can happen to anyone if you don't ask for advice from different people. Seeking opinions from many different people is important for decision making because you need to see a problem from different points of view to make the most sensible conclusion and if you ask one biased person they may lead you to the wrong choice for you.

Getting advice from more than one person can help you see your problem in many different point of view, therefore multiple opinions will lead you to having a sensible take on your choice. A few months ago my sister and I had a fight, she took my favorite dress and spilled food on it. I was terribly frustrated and confused so I called one of my friends. I asked her advice and she said that I should make my sister pay to get me a new one. The next day I was talking to me mom and I learned that my sister wore the dress on her first date that night, during the date he spilled her spaghetti all over herself. My sister came home crying because she felt worthless. Imagine if I only asked my friend what to do. I would have gotten mad at an already miserable older sister. Asking different people for advice led me to see my problem in a different way. Seeing from a wide point of view will help you make better choices because you know all the parts of the story.

If you only ask one person for their advice their opinion may be biased even if they don't mean it to be. If I ask for advice from my sisters about school, I always make sure to get other opinions because my sisters moved here in ninth grade, so their high school experience is way different then mine will probably be. Even if you trust someone they might not know whats best for you because they intertwine what is the right choice for you and what would be the right choice for them. For example, if someone wants to protect you they may lure you towards the safe option instead of the choice best for you. That is why it is so important to ask for multiple peoples advice because that makes your view unbiased.

Asking for advise from multiple people is mandatory because if you only ask for advice from one person your view on the issue will be biased and incomplete. Making important decisions is hard, but asking for multiple opinions makes it that much easier. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
606C73F97E17,"Have you ever gotten into a conflict with someone and you took into your own hands, but it didn't go too well?

Everyone gets into arguments, it's what make us humans. Most people have a mindset that says, ""it's either my way or the highway."" Having that way of thinking can be good in some cases, but in others not so much.

I believe that a person should take advice from others because it can help you see other perspectives, not take your own bias, and learn from the situation.

Seeing a different perspective on the situation is good because it tells you other ways of doing things that you never considered trying. Many people have probably been in that same situation and can tell you what they did. Hearing what other people have done can expand your mind into doing something totally different from what you were intending to do, which can be good. I remember a time where I was in a conflict with my friend, and didn't know how to handle it. I asked others to help me find a way to try getting my friend back, and they gave me some suggestions. Using their insight helped me get my friend back.

Not taking your own opinion is good because most of the time we think that we are always right. Which can make it hard to take others knowledge. Not taking your own bias can help by letting you break from your comfort zone, expanding into doing something you don't often do. For some, it's apologizing. When mutiple people tell you what they would've done it gives you any idea of what to do. Which can make it easier if you weren't too sure about your orginal one.

Learning from the situation is always better because it can help you grow as a person. For example, if someone gets into a fight with someone and they get suspended they learn that fighting others can result in a bad consequence. It's better to take the learning part with you throughout life because it can benefit you when others ask for your opinion on the same or a similar topic. As a result, you can get a more positive outcome, and less likely of a negative.

In conclusion, we should seek for mutiple opinons because it can benefit you in a more positive way. Seeking insight from others can be better for you by helping you see other perspectives, not taking your own bias, and learn from the situation. Others have different ways of thinking so taking a bit of that knowledge to better yourself for the future can be good. Not everyone thinks what you were intending to do would've turned out good, but that's just more of a reason to seek others opinions. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

When someone gives you an idea for a business there basically trying to help you invest in money or help you gain money for the better if the buisnes and the owner himself. Let's say a construction worker is about to go and build a house or another type of building you need someones opinion or idea to make sure your doing it right so therefore people can by your builing. People even need ideas or opinions when it comes to eating at a resteraunt, your not going to eat nasty food are you?

When people ask for advice the are asking for your opinion or how feel to feel about the subject the person is talking about. When people bring up asubject about something you bring up more than one person because it was more then one persons Idea or opinion. Now that you cn see basically the whole world woudln't be what it is today if it weren't for idea's and opinions.

The are is never a bad Idea or opinion also every question that you ask is a good question. Things get built faster and even things get invented based off somobodys opinion. Whenever you feel as if you need to ask a question go ahead and ask the question because there is never a bad question to ask because you might be on the verge of creating something new and just don't know it yet.

Lots of eventers createed a lot things based on there opinion on something. Thomas Edison belived that he could make a ball of light and what did he do he mad the light bulb and every single house in the world that uses electricity uses the light bulb,I even got one at my house. Bengimin Franklin wanted to find out what lightning was so he went outside with a kite and a and a key and he captured and it couldv'e killed him.

Even public speakers have there own opinions how do you think African American children and American children are in the same school,becasue Martin Luther King Jr belived or felt as if that the shouldn't be segregated any longer. The thing is about that is that is was his opion and helt to need he needed to say what he thought to everybody now lookat the world.

29235C3B3472,"""when i need some advice, i speak to many other people to get there opinion on thing's"" i said to my friend that is seeking for advice.

The reason many people ask more than one person for advice might be because he or she may not feel insecure of something, or someone so then they might go ask someone for advice to think and process on there opinions. It like buying a new pair of shoe's, you want to get the pair that makes you look clean and fresh with your outfit so you would ask for other's opinion to help you decide on which pair to get.

you don't have to ask people for advice if you don't feel like they aren't gonna give you the right advice you are seeking, ask the people that you trust the most. like your parents,your sibling,your other relatives,and even your friends. who ever makes you feel happy or secure to speck with about your problem that needs advising.

But the more you ask for advice the better the outcome will be. because you ask many other people for there opinion just as i am doing right now writing my own opinion about asking for advice from someone. and never let down on any good advice people give you.

FF3F4514BF85,"Everyone in this world has probably wanted to try something new and extravagant, but they probably want someones opinion on the activity before they go off and try it on their own. When most people ask for advice they're like why should I ask, who cares, well here is some reasons why it would be good to ask for advice. You could find someone who has experienced the activity first hand, someone could maybe even help you create a brand new opinion you have never thought about, or the advice could help you with your take, or opinion on the activity. All of these things will definitely help you make the right decision in the end.

One of the first things you could do if you needed some advice is ask someone who has been through, or experienced the activity. You could ask them how it was, what you did, or even simply is it worth the money or time. Another reason this is a good idea is it can show you the good or bad outcomes. You can ask the person to elaborate on the topic a little more if they can to see if your'e actually interested in their experience with the activity. This option will definitely help you in the long run when you make your decision.

When asking for advice, people will have plenty different takes on what will happen. This may cause someone to bring a new opinion into your head. This could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you take it. If you handle it well you can more likely understand the other persons point of view on the activity. Something else a person can do is convince you to change your mind. Now this can be a big one because they could tell you a story or a myth about how something could go wrong, because grant it people are less likely to go somewhere or do something if they hear a horrifying story or myth.

Finally something else that could happen while asking for advice and trying to make a good decision is someone could just simply agree with you. This is probably either the most helpful one or least helpful one. It can be very helpful if the person your'e talking to will help you add more detail, or another possibility would be they can give you new ideas, with a different point of view, but have the same main idea. One of the more negative, or least helpful things someone could do for you is agree and walk away, and if that happens you can just go find someone else to talk to.

In conclusion, I belive these ideas will help you make the right choice in the end. From asking someone who has had the experience, to someone helping you create a new opinion, or someone even just elaborating on your topic. Don't just say who cares, and why should I ask for advice, go out and explore the possibilities. Now I hope with this advice you go out and make the right decision in the real world.                           ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
53BA0A8722FF,"Your friend's advice is helpful, but others can be too! It doesn't hurt to hear different thoughts from people. The more advice you have is better. Seeing that others have succeeded is people great to ask! You can make good choices than ever and be successful too. Seeking for multiple opinions is helpful because it can show stronger opinions, you can have multiple ideas, and find new advice.

Since you are hearing more than one opinion, you can see which option would be stronger. People may have shared the same ideas, but that can mean that others are using the same advice a lot too. It's probably the most helpful to use! Usually the more people that follow the advice, you can know that it's trustworthy. For example, I have a lot of friends that shared the same advice to me. My friends all have succeeded well. I now know the advice that they've given me is helpful, since they all were successful. Hearing same ideas from people can be a strong opinion that is useful.

Having more ideas is helpful. The less ideas you have, you can run out of thoughts easily. Running out of advice to use can lead your mind blank. You won't be able to focus well, due to you trying to think of a new idea. Let's say someone gave you an advice that isn't helpful. Well, you have plenty to follow if you had lots of advice given. The more advice you have, is better since you have many ideas on your head. You will be less able to lose your track of thoughts.

You can find new advice. You never head of it, but it's always good to try something new. Most of the times, new advice can be helpful. You can share the advice to others for them to follow. If it lead you to success, it can lead them too! It starts a repeating cycle of people sharing new advice to each other. I was once given an advice that no one else ever told me. I stated using the advice and I did well! I recommended it to others, and they did just as good as I did. Give it a try! Something that others didn't share, doesn't mean the person's advice for you is useless. It could be the most helpful advice given to you!

Hearing multiple opinions from each other is useful because it can show stronger opinions, having more than one idea, and you can find new helpful advice. It really helps for you to hear different perspectives from everyone. It shows what can lead them to success. The advice they gave you can end up you being successful too!

6F5652DC6E6A,"My grandmother once told me, ""When seeking advice always get more than one opinion."" I think she told me that because, people opinions could be good for you and its probably a good idea for you to listen. Or that person thoughts could be horrible and could cost you your future as a criminal and that would lead to you being behind bars. But a positive outcome is that multiple opinions is better than one because what people think is the best idea for you is probably a good idea for you to listen. But also their ideas could be bad and good at the same time so when you apply the advice to the situation and could have a positive and negative outcome.

I personally think when getting advice always go search for it in your most trustworthy friends and family so that they can give you a good opinion. When you ask them and you receive lots of the same response it probably a good idea to listen and take their knowledge in and use it. Most importantly if you receive other information not like the other information your family and friends gave you its good to try the advice. Only to see if they give good advice or just to see if it was a better idea.

Also not all advice is good advice. Receiving advice from people that you know will lead you down a bad life or a bad lifestyle could get you into a lot of trouble or you could get hurt. When seeking advice make sure they know what they're talking about and if it doesn't seem right most likely their opinion is bad.

52779E469111,"Why do people ask multiple people for their opinion? Shouldn't they just trust one opinion? People sometimes ask for multiple opinions to help them with a tough decision. It can be difficult to make choices for yourself sometimes. You can give someone advice, but they would ask other people what they thought too. Seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial to a person making a decision because it gives them more options, multiple points of view, and helps them make the best decision.

The more options the better when it comes to making choices. When people ask for advice from multiple people, they get more options of what they could do. Having more options is better for the person trying to make to choice. For example, if Generic_Name asks me for my advice on which running event she should do. I might say the two-hundred meter, but Generic_Name might say the one-hundred meter. After we both give her our opinion she has to choose. It it important to get more options before making choices. The more options people have the better choice they can make for them self.

When people have a decision they need to hear other peoples advice. If the person making the choice doesn't ask other people for advice they will follow what they think is right, even if it is wrong. The person making the choice would think it is right because that is their side of it, but if they ask other people they will see more than their side, and might not follow their own advice because they realized it was wrong. The person only realized they were wrong when they asked the other person for advice. Also when a person ask other people for advice they see what other people would think of them depending on the choice they make. When people see what other people would think of them sometimes it influence the decision that they make. When they ask for advice it shows them more points of view.

When people ask multiple people for advice they get more options and more points of view, but it also helps them make the best choice possible. When people ask for advice it shows them that their first choice might not have been the best. it also helps them get more options, so that they can make the wisest choice of what they should do. It can be difficult for a person the choose what they think is best for them, but the advice that is given to them really helps them make the best choice. People should always ask for multiple opinions before making a choice because it is very beneficial to them as they make the choice. Asking for multiple opinions will help the person make the best choice.

In conclusion, it is important for people to ask for advice before making a decision. Asking for multiple opinions is helpful for many reasons. The advice they are given will give them more options of what to do, show them more points of view, and it will help them make the choice that will benefit them the most. When someone asks you for advice try to give them advice that will benefit them the very most. It is important for them to get good advice to make the best possible decision.

8A40C9A48BC3,"When you ask for advice, who and how many people do you go to? Is that one person bias or generally cares for you. Is one person more reliable than another. Seeking for advice from more than one person is much better for you than asking on person. If you were to compare asking one person or asking multiple people, there would be a lot more benefits to asking more people for advice instead of one.

Asking multiple people can help you make more sense of your problem or issue. Asking more than one person for advice can make your decision or solution less bias. You can go to another person for advice and talk about another person's response. This new person can say their thoughts on someone else's. This can help you get a clearer picture on you issue. There are many more opinions when you ask multiple people as well. Asking multiple people is like collecting data in an experiment. When you collect more data, you answer to you hypothesis is more clear. When you collect more advice, it gives you a more definite conclusion and answers you issue and/or question. Asking multiple people for advice can also make you feel like you are not pressured to make one choice. This is because there are more people to ask advice from.

If you were ask one person for advice, that one person can bring you down and make you feel like you have to go with their advice. No one should feel this pressure. By having this pressure, you can feel worse about your situation than you did before you asked for advice. Asking advice should help you and help you move in the right direction for you and only you. That one person that you ask advice form may not even like or care for you like some of your other friends do. When you ask that person for advice, they may lead you in the wrong direction or not see what the best option for you is. Asking one person means less advice and more of a chance of getting negative advice.

If you were to be bullied at school, would you go to one person or go to multiple sources for help. If you were to ask one person, they may tell you good or bad advice. They may say to beat the bully. This can pressure you to do what that one person said because that is the only person you turn to. If you were to ask multiple people, one may say that you should go punch the bully. Another may say to go to the dean for help. Another person may say that you should go to your parents and so on. When you compare the responses of your friends and trusted adults, you see that two people want you to do the right thing while the other person doesn't. People have different opinions and advice. How you take that advice and use it is up to you. By asking more people for advice, you can be more secure and certain of your choice than asking one person. In this certain instance, you would most likely go with the people who said to go to a trusted adult because they both said it along those lines.

Asking more than one person for advice can make you feel better about yourself and your decission. Asking one person can make youi feel traped with only one way out. Asking more than one person will most deffinatly help you make a better choice than if you were to ask one person. Advice is important to everybody. It helps you determain what choices you make. Getiing bad advice can be harmful especially when it involves multiple people and people that you care about.

3609B5F15C8C,"In my opinion I think getting advice from more than one person is good because... 1. You can get multiple answers and thoughts. When you think about all the answers you've got then you can come up with your own advice for yourself. Then when you have you advice you can make the best choice for you.

2. It's best to ask multiple people anyways because then you wouldn't get stuck with one answer that could possibly be the wrong advice for you.

Sometimes you could get the right answer from anyone, but you could find the right advice your looking for from someone that needed the same advice before also.

C9F4BEBB3C8A,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Asking for advice is like getting a check-up; it benefits everyone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, for it can benefit some of his or her decisions, helps with deciding on things, and can give better options of choices.

To begin with, seeking multiple opinions can benefit some of his or her decisions. Some people tend to ask for advice when something is extremely hard to decide on. Half of those people ask one person while the other half asks multiple people. Asking multiple people, however, helps to knock out the bad options that they assume will not benefit the situation you are in. It also helps you with getting better opinions, towards your choices, from them. For example, my friend, Generic_Name, needed advice from someone about a situation that was going on in her life at the time. She asked one person, but their opinion did not help her with the decisions she had to make. So, she asked multiple friends of hers for their opinions. After narrowing her options down from what her friends had said, she successfully made a better decision that benefit her afterwards.

Also, it can help with deciding on things. When you are put into a situation that needs something to be decided on, most ask others, because the pressure and stress from that problem gives that person a hard time. With the supportive opinions and choices given from your friends or family, the stress and anxiety that comes around soon disintegrates and feels like a huge weight is lifted off your shoulders once the problem is fixed. For instance, I was put in a situation where I had to make a tough decision. Due to the fact it was already stressful and hard to handle, I asked a few of my friends for advice on it. After them supporting me and helping me decide on what they thought I should do, I eventually made the right decision for myself.

To end with, this can give better options of choices. Half the time, people think their options for their own problem will be helpful, because it is less time and stress for them. Sometimes, friends or family may have better opinions for you. If you get different opinions and more options, it makes deciding a lot easier. Your list of choices may be added to or taken away from, but either way, putting multiple options together from what others may have said will make deciding easier due to to better options. To illustrate, my brother, Generic_Name, needed help deciding on what project choice he should do for his end of the year project. He made the assumption it would be better to ask people he knew would be able to help him make that decision. After asking his other siblings, including me, he narrowed down his options by deciding on what he enjoyed most to the amount of points he would get doing certain projects and finally made a good choice from the options we had given him.

However, seeking multiple opinions could make things harder when making a choice. Sometimes, getting opinions could make the problem worse, because one of your friends may say something you will not like or just something you do not want to hear. Multiple opinions can also add stress to you because everyone you ask may say completely different things, which will not help you make the choice. You could also be given options that, either do not make any sense for your situation or make everything harder for you.

In conclusion, when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions from people can benefit choices by knocking out the bad options and getting better options for you. It can also help you decide on things by getting the support from your friends during the hard times of deciding on something. Lastly, you are given better options, whether it is taking away or adding to the options you already have. This is why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
B1EF45488EA7,"Why do people ask more than one person for advice?

Well I am here to tell you why so many people ask more than one person. There are four main reasons, One is Someone may know the person you talking about and knows how to help, Two if the people you talk to say the same thing or similar use that one to solve your problem, And last but not least it shows you care for that person. Alright now im going to tell you how all of these implie to a person asking more than one friend to help with a problem.

Someone may know the person your talking about and knows how to help .

If you ask a friend who knows there person your talking about then your more likely to know how to fix what happend. If they trust the person your asking that person would tell you what you should do, wether its giving them some space or being there for them and making sure there ok. Another good reason is its showing that you tust these people enough to give you a good awnser to help.

If the people you talk to say the same thing or similar use that one or sum up what they said to solve your problem.

One thing a lot of people dont understand is that if you get the same awnser or a similar one from more than one person you think well they must be lieing or theres no way thats the right way, But a lot of the time it is and you either hurt the person your trying to make up with more or your making there friends mad because you didnt listen to what they had to say. Rember your trying to help so take there advice espcially if they known the person longer.

It shows you care for that one person.

If you go asking more than one person it shows them that you care about the person you messed up with and are trying to fix what happended between you guys. Friends love seeing someone worry about there friend who was hurt or upset, they love knowing you feel bad for what you did and love seeing that your putting in effort to make up the wrongs that occured. Friends are supposed to look out for friends and your obviously looking out for them when you ask more than one person.

Now lets put everything together . Ok ok I know what your thinking "" What if they care to much and become over protective?"" well I have that awnser, Tell them you need space and if they dont listen try to ignor them and be with the people who love you and care about you.

0C3BBDB91972,"When you're trying to get advice on a choice, do you ask multiple people or do you ask on person? People usually ask many people on a decision or choice for many reasons. Having more opinions is having better knowledge about a choice. Getting advice from one person isn't going to cut it all the time. Seeking multiple opinions on a choice or decision is going to help someone get a better understanding, better point of view, and a better judgment.

Its very important to have a better understanding of a choice or decision. Having a better understanding is being more confident and definite about making the better choice.

More minds you have working the better the design is, same thing goes for this too, have more minds, better the decision. You have a better chance making the better choice having multiple opinions. When your getting advice from one person your only getting their opinion, and maybe its good or bad but that's why you need different point of views.

Having a better point of view is basically seeing how other people see it and how they're different and how they're the same. If majority of people say the same thing, then it is usually the better choice. Your getting see how different people experienced it or how people have dealt with it. Getting multiple answers will get you what want and need at the same time. Getting a better point of view is especially important in making the better choice.

Getting a better judgment is getting a final decision on things. You want to know what is good a choice and a bad choice. Its like getting a review on a restaurant, you want to the know the reviews, whether they're good or bad, its to get a better judgment on things and that's what you need. Having a better judgment is the most important thing into why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you usually make the final choice when you have a better judgment.

Seeking multiple opinions on a choice is going to help someone get a better understanding, better point of view, and a better judgment. You need a better understanding to have a more confident choice and and be more definite about it. You need a better point of view to see how other people experienced it and how it effected them in a good or bad way. Finally, you need a better judgment to get a good final decision on things.

13224DF00A6A,"Good advice can be tricky to come by. Most people, when looking for an answer, tend to go to family or friends. Seeking out a trusted person in your life could be good, but only asking one person most likely won't help you to the extent you may be looking for. Not everyone is the same, and one person could give you advice that worked for them, but might not benefit you. Asking multiple people gives you different viewpoints and options to think over.

What makes up good advice? Well advice in general is a piece of information or and opinion on a situation. You could be asking for help ranging from a moral issue to a fight with friends. Advice can be found everywhere, in quotes, poems, books, from your friends, family, teachers, or even strangers. Good advice usually comes from a known source, or someone you can trust. Everybody looks for a different type of advice, even if it doesn't work for you, it could still work for someone else. Good advice is something that will help you fix a problem or help you see things differently than you have before.

When faced with a problem, many people ask for advice. Advice is one of those things that anyone can give, but not all are good at. If you have one friend who always gives good advice, you may gravitate towards them first, rather than someone who may not be as skilled. However, everybody has different experiences, and may be able to relate to your problem more than someone else. Asking people who have been in your situation is a great way to hear what they did and weigh the options.

If someone is given two options, they will likely take less time thinking over the options and choosing between the two than they would if given multiple. Having a variety of opinions and solutions may help you weigh out the good and bad. Only having one option could keep you from seeing the bad parts of the plan because you have nothing else to compare it to. Though it may take longer, deciding which works best for you may be worth it in the end.

There are multiple ways to compare advice. First, make a pros and cons list. These are very simple to make and are a good way to see exactly what each bit of advice entails. Another good way is to just simply think through each scenario. Say to yourself, if I follow this advice, then what would happen. If any piece of advice leads to a bad or undesirable outcome, you may want to eliminate it and choose a different one. The last way to compare could be to think of the source. Did this advice come from someone reputable, or trustworthy, do they have experience in my situation, and would they possibly lie to protect me or to keep my feelings from being hurt? If the source turns out to be bad, then move onto your next option.

Not all people like talking about their problems to many people. These people may decide on a solution, then simply to a sort of poll, to validate it. They may ask someone, should I do this, and weigh the amount of ""yes"" to the amount of ""no"" and decide whether or not it is good based off of that. Though this method works, you may be blind sided and not be able to see both parts of your solution. Rather than doing a yes or no poll, asking people for advice and instead, writing them down and grouping them together by what they mean is a better way to conduct a poll. If someone tells you yes or no, they aren't able to tell you exactly what they do or do not like about your idea.

Asking advice from multiple people could benefit you in many ways. You have more options, more sources, and more to think about. Even though not every bit of advice you get may work for you, it is important to hear different points of view. Just because you know someone and trust them, doesn't mean they always know what is best for you.

In the end, it is up to you to decide what you listen to. Choose the advice you take carefully, not all of it is there to help you.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
DC071D6F4B9B,"Asking multiple people for advice can really pay off. The majority of people consult more than one person before making a decision. This can really help them to make the best choice possible. Whether you take their advice or not, asking multiple people can never hurt or harm you. Asking multiple people for advice is fantastic because you can get more ideas, they can help you decide what is the best choice for everyone around you, and they can assist you in making the overall best choice or decision.

Asking for multiple people's opinions and advice is awesome because it can give you more ideas. When talking to different people they all might have different ideas of what you should do. Even though it may seem a bit daunting, having a lot of ideas can never hurt you. It can only help you make the best choice possible. Maybe you thought you should do something one way but then your friend, coworker, or even teacher has another way you should do something. Nine times out of ten we think something can only be done one way. Our vision can be clouded but other ideas can help to clear our vision just a little bit.

One day we all will have to make a decision or choice that will affect others around you. That choice might be weighing on you, dragging you down until it is finally made. That choice might be a difficult one but asking others can help relive the stress of that decision. If the choice evolves or affects other people it can be hard, but asking those around you can always help you. Say you get invited to two sleepover parties on the same night and you don't know which one to go to, ask your parents or ask friends that might be going to the sleepovers for their advice. Having multiple people you can get advice from can be a ginormous game changer. That decision that is grinding you down can easily be lifted away if you ask for multiple people's advice.

Getting advice from multiple people can help you make the overall best choice. People always have different ideas of how things should go, but getting more than one person's opinion can help you to narrow down the options until you have found the final, best choice. One hundred percent of the time you ask for more than one person's advice you find the answer you were looking for so much faster. Different people with different backgrounds can have amazing advice that can totally change the way you think. The advice could be something you never even thought of. We love thinking we are doing everything right, but getting advice from multiple people can help show us how we were wrong. More importantly it can show us how to do something better. The advice givers can also help guide us to the best answer. When you receive advice from multiple other people the best piece of advice typically finds a way to you.

Multiple pieces of advice can be magnificent, but they can also confuse you until you have no idea what is right or what is wrong. That is why it is always best to work with others, and receive their advice. Getting multiple people's advice is always worth asking because it can give you way more ideas that you didn't even think of, it can help create decisions that are best for others, and they can help you make the overall best choice. Even though it can be difficult asking for advice, it is always worth hearing what people have to say. It is even better when you ask multiple people for their thoughts or advice. Remember that even though you asked you do not always have to take the advice. Even if it is really good advice or if it is terrible advice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
A2E37BB8E275,"Since the beginning of time, humans have been known to ask for advice from more than one person, whether it be for the best way to cook dinner or for the best method to conquering a country. Recently, it has been questioned as to why people ask multiple people for advice. Asking multiple people for their opinions on a topic could waste time and effort if the topic turns out to be a bad choice. However, going into one thing based off of a single person's opinion could potentially waste more time. Instead, seeking more than one opinion can help people make better decisions because everyone thinks differently. First, hearing people's experiences gives someone accurate information. Second, creating a survey showing the pros and cons of the subject could give someone an idea of what the subject is about. Finally, getting a variety starting programs could allow people to understand what their current level is at. Knowing this, asking multiple people for their opinions would allow someone to understand the topic and create a confident decision.

First, hearing of someone else's experience could benefit the beginner. If people were to start a game without looking at reviews, they would not know if that game was good or bad. Reading the reviews would allow the player to understand if the game would suit their taste or if it is not worth their time. A second example would be of an author making a realistic fiction book based on soldiers experiences during a war. The aspiring author could ask veterans of their experiences in the military or the battlefield to get accurate information. If the author were to ask only one veteran, they would only get one person's opinion and not everyone else's. However, asking for multiple opinions would allow the author to write about what an average soldier felt during their time in training or war. Hearing everyone's experience in a subject would allow one person to get an understanding on the topic instead of hearing a single opinion.

Second, getting a better viewpoint on the topic would allow someone to get a more unbiased opinion. Asking just one person of their opinion on a book is not enough. Instead, asking more people would allow someone to see what type of book it is. Elaborating on this, someone might tell their friend they dislike a romance novel because they do not like romance. However, the friend could ask another friend who might say they enjoyed the book because of the plot. Creating a survey on the topic could also help the reader graph out the pros and cons of the book; having a good story line and a bad romance. The survey could also show the reader if the book is a good fit for them depending on what the reader likes to read. Making a survey based on people's opinions on a subject would allow someone to understand if the subject is good for them.

Finally, if the person has decided that they want to start learning the topic, getting advice on how to begin from different people is a good way to learn. For example, learning how to program. If someone were to want to program but did not have anyone to guide them in the beginning, they would not know where to start. Getting one opinion might not help either; the starting point the person gave might not help their friend because they both have different methods of learning. However, getting different sources of learning could help a person learn how to code. For example, the first person someone asks for advice from might have a difficult program that is above one's skill level. However, that program could be used for a later time when a person reached that point. The second person someone could ask for advice might have a better starting point because they both started to program with the same amount of initial experience. Receiving different sources would allow someone to try out new methods of learning and seeing which one benefits them the most.

To make the best choice, people talk to more than one person to get different opinions on the subject. Hearing of multiple people's experiences could benefit other people because it allows them to understand the difficulty of the task. Getting a survey of everyone's opinions could tell a person what the general viewpoint of this topic was. Finally, asking for the best ways of how to start would allow them to receive the best education. Asking for advice from multiple people could give a person a better perspective on a topic and decide whether or not they want to spend time on it. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5EF660E481FF,"Do you ask more than one person for advice? When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person because people have different things to say, people want to find the best advice, and find who listens the best.

People have different things to say. People have different opinions. The person can sort the options out in their head, and can make the decision faster. Another thing is others ideas. Others ideas could help situations and tell you what is best. If multiple people share options, you will have more to chose from. Having more options makes you feel better so you have a wider range of options to chose from.

Next, you want to find the best advice. Find a trustworthy person. Someone wont belittle you for your decisions or judge you. Listen to people and what what they have to say. You have to realize that unsolicited advice does not always mean bad advice.

Lastly, who listens the best. you can tell who really cares. If they are trying to help you instead of just doing nothing, it shows. You can tell if they are fully present and in the moment to help you. Most people would keep eye contact with you. Eye contact shows that they have your full attention. Listeners will encourage you to keep talking and will give you feedback.

8A10A65857EE,"Have you ever needed good advice? Just ask a lot of different people for good advice. If you're going to pick something out, a lot of opinions will help.

you might make a bad choice without asking for advice, you don't want to make the wrong choice either, you can also add on to someones advice they gave you to get a better outcome, getting a lot of advice will also make you more confident.

You want to get a lot opinions and advice to make the best choice. Let's say you want to get a big smart dog breed but you only ask one person for advice on your choice. You might get a good or bad answer. They could think a certain dog breed is good, but turns out it's just, not what you wanted. But if you asked multiple people you'll have a better outcome. A lot of people will probably mention same dogs, like a German Sheppard or Great Dane. There is an upside to only asking on person for advice though. It's faster, asking only one person or no one is easier but the outcome won't be as good. If you asked a lot of people instead, the outcome will be much better.

Getting a lot of different advice is good because you don't have to just use one persons advice you could use multiple. You could be going on a vacation and not knowing any good places to go, or places in a city you could going to. If you have an idea where you want to go like somewhere sunny, warm, cold etc. if you ask multiple people, they'll probably know a few places. Same with if you ask one person, but you're only hearing it from one person, it doesn't give you a lot of places to go. When you ask a lot of people some will probably be more specific and say good restaurants and other places or activities you could try. Then you'll have your full plan with a whole bunch of different places you could go and enjoy.

Lots of advice can make you more confident. Maybe you're trying something new, like a new sport. One person could leave some things out, but if you ask multiple people, another person could say something one person left out. People could give you advice on what equipment to buy, or if there's a certain type or size of ball you need to buy for your age group. If you ask multiple people, at least one will help you practice and teach you the basics. Then when you go to the actual practice you'll be ahead of your teammates or ahead of the new ones. This would help a lot of people because people usually nervous to start something they've never done before. People might think you're really bad and not don't anything about what you're doing. People might yell at you and I don't know someone who likes being yelled at.

In the end it's your choice if you want a lot, a little, or no advice. I suggest you should get the most advice you can get. There are so many reasons for getting advice, It makes you more confident, and you have an idea in what you want to do. You know you're going to make a good choice and you can create your own plan with other people's advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Seeking advice from more than one person can help the type of situation your are in, or if you need help on something than people can give advice on what you need.

Asking more than one person for opinions will have a lot of different thoughts, and opinions will also help because it will tell you what other people think of what ever situation you are in.

A92B69B40619,"When asking for advice, you don't always hear what you would like. Everyone has their own opinion ,but some can lead you to good or bad things; really depends on the person. You should go to the people you trust the most or feel most comfortable. Asking more than one person for advice can bring you up by giving you good ideas and helping your future. There are many other reason why asking other people for advice and these are my reasons .

There are many people in world who don't want the best for you even without knowing you ; thats why you should go to the people you can trust the most or have a close bond with. When asking one person you clearly get one opinion ,but maybe its best asking other people for their opinion on whatever situtation it is. Seeking other peoples opinion can really effect you . Having support can be a big thing in someones life and showing it can really show that you want the best for them. Supporting your friend to a good desicion is always helpful because being by their side can really show your true colors . If don't have anyone to talk to it can really bring you down and keep everything bottled up. When most people give advice they dont really think of the situtation thats why asking more people can be extremly helpful. I understand if you don't get the situtation because you might not know what to say , or your just not putting your in their position, but as long as you supporting them thats all that matters .

Seeking peoples true colors can also make you see who they really are . If the person or people or whoever you ask for advice is making you do a bad thing or get things in your head maybe that person just doesn't care or could careless of you . Seeing the way that they treat you or talk to you can make you think twice or multiple times ; good or bad. Some can lead you to your future, and you should really keep them in your life because those are the type of people ,you want to be positive . Advice is a big thing that you may not realize but you use it everyday like for example ,"" do you like my outfit"" , "" does this taste good "" etc. The little things you dont realize are the ones you use everyday.

Now lastly the people . You may not notice but we are all pretty cool in our own way or just pretty mean . The people that surround us are the people we know ; yes you may not be friends with them but atleast you know them or you might have heard something about them . Getting advice from the people you dont know personally isn't the best idea . Close friends , family members , consulers are the best to talk to even if you ask others.

3BA2029AFBC0,"When I have a problem. I like to ask multiple people for advice. That is one of the best ways I figure my problems out. An opinion can have a large affect on me. Depending on who that person is. Honestly, I think people should ask more than one person for advice. When a person in general has a problem. I like to think that two thoughts go through their mind. One, I should figure this problem out in my own. Two, I should ask more than one person for their opinion.

If someone were to listen to them self, they might make the wrong choice. In my opinion, humans tend avoid the things they don't want to do. That could be doing homework, cleaning or making dinner. When it comes to making a decision, you could could be put in a difficult situation. Putting pressure on someone, to make the best choice. Most people offend over think situations. They delay the decision they were going to make. Then they end up listening to them self. Not thinking about the other people involved in the matter. When they really should think about the other people involved.

Asking a variety of people, is more helpful than you would think. Especially if someone were to ask older people. I say that because of the experience they might have. They have been on this earth for a long time. Seeing the changes that have happened over time. It is possible that the person you happen to ask, has been through the same thing or something close to it. An example would be parents. In the end they only want what's best for you. Not to repeat the mistakes they may have made in their life. They can give some great advice.

Psychologically, I think it takes a large toll out of a person's brain. Not telling anyone the problems someone might have, or asking for advice. If someone starts to chose one decision. Then decides to go back and think about the other decisions they may have. It could possibly render the first decision useless. If they decide their first choice was not correct. Leaving that person lost. Not knowing what the right choice is. Keeping that person thinking about the problem for hours and not letting them move on. If you don't tell anyone about the problems you may have. How are they supposed to know? How are they supposed to help you work things out? Asking multiple can help you make a faster decision. Without as much stress involved.

Think of all the positive out comes that can come from asking multiple people for advice. You won't have to worry as much, you will be prepared, and you will let people know what's going on in your life. If it was something extremely bad. Asking a person for advice can help you get away from that situation. Be bullied would be an example of that. It doesn't have to be a bad thing either. If it was someones birthday. You could ask someone for their preference. If you wanted to buy them a gift.

That's why I think it's important for people to ask more than one person for advice. They can help save you from making the wrong decision or spending to much time thinking about it. It also not somthing that you only get advice for something that is bad. It can be helpful tips. People need to depend on each other once in awhile. By the experiences that other people may have. They can tell you stories of there life and how to prepare for next time you may have a problem. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
E83BEEE4EF18,"ASKING for ADVICE

We have all asked for advice at least once in our lives. You may not know how to ask or tell someone something. So when you are looking for advice,asking multiple people can help you get a better answer. When asking for advice you will get different opinions,different views,and different stories. All of these tings will give you a better choice when asking for advice.

If your asking for advice from someone you might get there opinion on the situation. Say the thing your asking about happened to them, they might put in there opinion. If you going to ask someone out on a date the person you asked for advice might give their opinion on where they like it or not. Whether the opinion is bad or not. You can take the persons good or bad opinion on the issue and change the way you feel about it to make it helpful to your situation. This is a good thing to look for when asking for advice.

Another thing to look for when asking for advice is different stories. When people get older they gain more stories. So when you ask for advice they might tell you a story from a time when they did the same thing your asking about. If you ask them how to tell someone something of importance they might tell you a time they did the same thing. You can take that information and get all the advice you need to tell go and tell the person the the thing you want to tell. You can also get life advice from listening to other peoples stories. When you ask for their advice you might get more than you needed in return. This would help you get the answer your looking for.

Now the last thing is, you might just get different advice in general. Every person you ask is going to give you a wide variety of advice. When your listening to the person you can take notes. Then rule out the one that makes the most since and use that as the advice you use to do the thing you were asking about. Listening to people advice is a great way to learn as well. If the persons advice works then you can use the same advice if someone asks the same question you asked. This would be a great way to get different stories and opinions for a better choice when asking for advice from someone.

Getting advice is a common thing that humans do. It gives us different views and opinions, but asking more that one person gives us loads of information and stories. So in conclusion I think that asking multiple people is a perfect way to get a better answer on what you are looking for. All of the thing I mentioned can also be applied to you. If someone asking you for your advice then you can you these thing to give them a better answer.                 ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
5B762EBD64C1,"Do you ever ask for advice? People ask for advice because they are confused about something. 90% of people ask for advice everyday. Some still cannot come to a conclusion. It is good to seek multiple opinions because you could learn something new that you never would have thought of on your own. After all, what we really want is the best solution. When people ask for advice, they sometimes ask more than one person because they could find new opportunities, they learn that some people show bias, and so they can see both sides.

First, asking for multiple opinions could open your eyes to more possibilities. I got the opportunity to get a scholarship to James Madison University. The problem was I wanted to be a pediatric oncologist and they do not have that at JMU. I was not going to go, but I was convinced to take the scholarship. At first I did not ask for any advice. My whole family wanted me to go. Although they did not help me decide, they said they would support the decision I made. My teacher said getting a full scholarship was once in a lifetime. I still had five years until college, so I had time to change my mind about my future career. She sat down with me and explained everything the JMU program did. She said they help get scholarships to other schools. The program was five years long. After that I would get to go to college. She showed me more options, that I never even knew about. If I did not ask her I would never be where I am today.

Second, if you ask someone for advice they may show bias towards one side. Politics are a perfect example. Lets say it's almost time to vote. You did your research on both candidates, but you are not sure who to vote for. They both have good arguments. So you ask your friend for advice. Your friend is only on one side. They do not even consider the other candidate. Now, you are back at he beginning. You could try to convince them to consider both sides, but they might argue with you. Some people might not care what you say. A couple months ago I put my application in at Tropical Smoothie and JC Penny. They both pay good. I heard back from both of them. My mom said I had to work at JC Penny because that is where she worked when she was a teenager. I told her that Tropical Smoothie is closer and pays more. Since I cannot drive yet she has to take me. She said she would only take me to JC Penny. So, I asked my dad and he said to work at the one I want. I now work at Tropical Smoothie and my dad takes me. I am happy I asked for more advice.

Third, it's good to get advice from people who see both sides. They could show you the good and bad. For example, I was struggling with something very important in my life. I had two options. One try out for softball and two keep being involved with my club FCCLA. I have played softball since I was four. I love it, but I have grown to love FCCLA even more. I am an officer and I am competing in the state competition. If I made the softball team, I could no longer be involved with FCCLA. There would not be time for both. So, I talked to my parents and my grandma. My parents wanted me to do softball. They were going to make me try out. Then, I talked to my grandma. She said I would love JV softball, but I would spend all my time doing it. She also said FCCLA looks great on a college application and it's fun. She showed me both sides. I talked to the coach and he compromised with me. He said I could practice with the team so I could have a flexible schedule. Asking another person really helped me with my decision.

In conclusion, people may ask more than one person for advice because it opens there eyes to new opportunities, some people you ask only see one side, and they want to see both sides. I learned that if you do not ask for advice or just ask one person you could miss out on a great opportunity. Some people have great advice but some people do not. Do not listen to someone who shows bias. It will not help you get anywhere. It is good to see both sides because you can see why your decision is good and bad. If you are confused just ask, it will help you so much. Imagine if you spent your whole life just waiting to decide.        ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
7D92AFA8EB0C,"Have you ever wanted to do something, but wasn't sure if it was the right decision? Well, sometimes it's good to get another person's opinion on the matter, and it's even better to get multiple opinions. It is good to see what the majority thinks, and if you're completely lost, it's good to have choices. Most importantly of course, is the fact that they may give you some helpful advice!

First off, It's good to see what the majority thinks about your issue. For example, it's Saturday and you have a project due Friday of next week. You want to take time on the weekend to relax, but you don't want to procrastinate. So you ask your friends and other people you know what to do. If the majority says do the project, you should probably do it. The majority decision is usually the best way to go.

Secondly, If you have no clue what to do, it is good to have some direction. Nobody likes being completely lost, so it is good to have a plan. But if you can't come up with one, then you're going to need some help. It's good to work with a group because you all have ideas that you can follow. Work together, and you can all come up with a good plan.

Lastly-and the most obvious- you can get other people's advice. Having a hard time deciding what to get for lunch? Ask all of your friends! If you have tough project that's due in three days, ask someone for design ideas. It is extremely helpful and will make youre life a thousand times easier!

In conclusion, asking for multiple opinions is extremely helpful. The majority decision is usually the best and having direction can help eliminate confusion. Lastly, you can get tons of helpful advice that will save you lots of head scratching! You can make better decisions in life if you have a direction to follow, and that's probably why we ask questions. Always remember to ask questions, because you may end up making better decisions. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

You feeling sorry towards your partner, so you decide that you want to surprise her and take her on a romantic suprise date. The problem is you really aren't the romantic type. You turn to your elder brother Generic_Name for advice, Generic_Name says you should take her out for shopping, then, take her to get her nails done, or maybe take her to the salon. After, when she thinks your both going home, you take her out to her favorite restaurant. You acknowledge his efforts in trying to help you. But what if your father has a better idea? You go to your father, He says ""When I was your age I would go to the dollar store and I would buy our favorite snacks like, Cheese Doodles, Galaxy Bars,Milky Ways, Atomic gummy worms. Then late night she would sneak me into her bedroom, and we would watch movies all night long.""

You take into perspective on what Father said, you rethink your plan. You take into account what both your Father and Generic_Name had to say about the situation. It gave you perspective, you could tell that Generic_Name had the idea of just going all out and spoiling her with clothes,jewelry,etc. But your Father had the more easy laid back classical idea of saving money, yet still maintaining the same level of quality that would have taken place if you took her out to a restaurant. As the days get shorter and date night gets closer, You decide that the night prior to the day you were going to take her out, you stop by the dollar tree on your way back from work. You pick up her favorite snacks, Super Worms, Lemon fizz pop,Chili burros. You make a basket of her favorite snacks all in one, but it doesn't end there, you go to her favorite burger joint,Up and Atoms. You buy her favorite Burger and an Ice cream shake. You decided that combining the ideas would become more efficient because you liked both the ideas, they both were good in there own way. You thought that combining the ideas would be better than just picking one

On the day of the date, you receive a call from your partner, you asking to make sure if everything is OK, and she says that her mother is in the hospital and is suffering from a stroke. You are in shock, you rush to the hospital, you get there and the doctors tell you that she is in critical condition. Having a stroke can really take a toll on your brain. It is even worse if your above the age of 60-65, your partner's mother being just over 70 puts her at great risk. Some time rolled around and She needed her daily check up and an iron infusion. For that you and your partner had to leave. Your partner is devastated, she can't get her mind off of her mother. You had no other choice but to delay date night. A few weeks pass by and your partner's Mom is out of the hospital and is healthy. She isn't allowed to leave the house and still needs to be checked up on regularly.

Later that day you decide to pull out all the food and set it up in your room. Having two different perspectives in mind when putting this surprise together allowed you come into the date with an open mind. The date went by great you and your partner are on good terms and had a great time with each other. After the date you sat down and gave it some thought."" What if I didnt ask my Dad, What if I didn't ask Generic_Name."" It is always good to have two different perspectives. It opens your mind up to what other people think about your situations. Its good to ask different people sometimes, for example lets say that you were thinking of getting your partner a gift, but you want to know what your friend Generic_Name thinks about the situation, you ask Generic_Name, he says that taking your partner on a date to her favorite restaurant would be a better idea.

Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. In order to make the best decision, you must go to the people you trust the most: your family. Family is always there for you, even when life seems at it's lowest. Asking the younger members in your family for advice might not be the brightest choice to make, but going to your elders is the best possible choice to make while seeking advice. Looking up to your elder family members is the best thing you can do when seeking opinions because, they have the most knowledge about how to act socially, and you know that you can fully trust them with what you're telling them. An instance where your elders come in, is what to say and when. Almost all teenagers have been made fun of or been in some form of drama and, they don't know what to say back to the bullies. That's where your elders come in. Your elders already know what it's like to feel that way, so they understand greatly. They give you multiple opinions and options to choose from when confronting the bullies. Many teenagers, including me have successfully stood up to bullies after talking with elder family members.

Let's face it, we've all had to face some terrifying situations and, we didn't know what to do. But we all have our families to guide us to make the right choices.

If you don't know what to do go get some opinions from others. Getting multiple perspectives from others helps you because you will get more opinions on what to do and what not to do.

First, knowing that you have more then one person to talk to and get their opinion, can make you more likely to go ask more people for them. If people have had similar problems to you, where other people have those problems. Get both opinions on this problem, the more opinions you get the more options you have on your choice. It can also turn into you helping someone if you go to them and you guys work together to fix this problem on both ends.

Next, talking to multiple people could lead to different emotions on this topic and help you understand how you could feel. You could have a strong feeling about your opinion but you always need to think about what you're going to say. The more you talk about this to others, the more you will hear yourself and your perspective might change. If your perspective changes this could cause you to do something different that can lead to you having a better choice and decision.

Lastly, if you get only one opinion that could have a negative impact on you, leading to you making the wrong choice which can't be undone. In past experience I have had to make some choices, many of them i'm not to proud with. Most of the time I went to get one persons opinion because I didn't have much faith or trust in others. That ended up badly because they gave me their opinion and I didnt have any other opinions to base her's off of, so the choice I made ended up being a mistake.

In conclusion, having many peoples opinions to make a better choice and not mess up is better than just getting one opinion. You need to think hard about whose/what opinion you're gonna take.

D31481D3B465,"People ask for advice and feedback almost everyday. It could be advice regarding fashion, education, or artistic feedback. For example, imagine a student finishing a project she's been working on for quite awhile. Before turning the assignment in, this student will most likely ask her peers for their opinions on it. However, notice how she won't ask one single person, rather multiple people for feedback.

Seeking multiple opinions and advice can help someone make better decisions by understanding and seeing different perspectives on the subject, and receiving new ideas they previously have never thought of.

Asking a single person for his opinion will only result in one perspective of the topic. If people were to ask and receive only one response, the outcome becomes very limited and may not connect with a large audience. In order for it to apply to the audience, everyone would have to have the exact same thought process and opinions as the person the author asked; which is very unlikely. If someone wishes to connect with a variety of people, in this case a larger audience, they must have an understanding of many perspective and points of view. This way the outcome will apply to more people with different thoughts and opinions.

When someone gives feedback, it's usually based off of the original idea that was given. However, there are scenarios where the advice given provides a brand new idea regarding the topic. Asking more than one person for advice and feedback allows a person to suggest ideas and concepts one may never have thought of. To put into context, a student asks her peer for feedback regarding her art project. While most of her friends give feedback and opinions that relate to her project, one of her friends gives advice that suggests a new idea to add onto her original project. Not only does the student know how to strengthen what she has already made, she can now add a new element that benefits her assignment.

Seeking multiple opinions and advice can be beneficial to someone because it can provide new ideas that previously have never been thought of, and help understand different perspectives on the topic. It's always important to ask for assistance and feedback when you need it. Because receiving that constructive criticism and working with it reassures the outcome is successful and applies to a larger audience. Overall, asking peers for their opinions can be an eye opener, and refresh one's mind in order to get their point across a variety of people. The more feedback one receives, the stronger the outcome becomes. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Prompt-My prompt is explain to people why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice

Seeking muitipule opinions is a better choice beacsue you can get a bunch of diffferent opinions and they most likey will have a better point of view. Its better to have mutilple choice then just having one choice or opinions now for some examples Example one If a student is having issuse at home they have mutiple opinions which are 1. talk to a counsler 2. talk to the school social worker 3. talk to a trusted adult 4. talk to a friends parent 5. talk to other family members..

example two a lady haves a few job offers but he goes for one and thinks he not going to pass the interview but he stll has a few jobs lining up behind him the job offers are1. sceintest at nasa 2. host on the ellen show 3. a buisness owner.

I also feel like asking one person would not be the best choice bescause what if they dont have have the best opinions or best advice,i feel like for the bst advice ask more then one person make sure the person is trustable make sure the person knows what they are talking about.

To make sure this trusted person know what they are talking about ask them a few quetions iif they answer them right then they might be a person you can trust

I know I have and advice is very helpful, especially when you get it from multiple people.

As kids we are just a step into life right now, but what matures us and gives us knowledge is advice.

Advice is the key to life and wisdom.

Lets say your talking to your parents about asking a girl to prom.

Getting that help and advice from multiple people can really benefit you in multiple ways.

Getting advice from one person is helpful, but you don't know how they went through during that experience.

Like the prom example what if you asked your dad for help instead but he got rejected, he could make prom sound like a terrible thing.

Life without wisdom and advice is like a maze, you don't know what decision to make like you don't know if you should go left or right.

The knowledge you get going through life and what others tell you, is what you want to pass down to the next generation.

getting advice from multiple people is key to being wise and good at making quick decisions.

4CC56880FDF0,"Asking for Advice

Sometimes when asking for advice, it is hard to know exactly who you can go to depending on the situation. Not everyone has been through the same thing that you're going through, so some people wouldn't know what advice to give you. That's why it is a better idea to talk to multiple people about your problems or situations.

Many different people have many different experiences. Some may know more than others, and some may be wiser than others. You can get more advice by talking to multiple people. They could give you different and better ways to handle the situation. Not everyone is going to have the same opinion of course, but that's up to you to figure out and decide which way you think is better to help your situation.

Talking to multiple people about your problems not only gives you more advice, but it makes you feel so much better! I know when i'm upset, talking to someone about it makes me feel a lot better. I know some people have trouble opening up to others. A lot of people have trust issues and don't know how to talk about there problems, but getting things off of your chest relieves so much stress. It's healthier for yourself to talk to people about how you feel and not keeping everything trapped inside of your head.

There are many different people that you can go to for advice. Talking to people who are older and wiser than you are is probably the better way to go. People you could talk to could be a close family member, a trusted teacher, your school councilor or any of your friends may be helpful too. At least one of them is going to know how you feel and how to help you. You're not alone and you have people to talk to. You might not know them very well, but that doesn't mean they can't still help you.                            ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
871287046F85,"Have you ever been asked for advice? Or asked for advice from someone? Or even a group of people? Well, I have. I believe that if you ask multiple people for advice, it could be very beneficial towards you. If multiple people help your situations, in which you asked for advice on, it can help you see different point of views and come to a better decision. All of this can improve the very important life skills of perspective and open mindedness.

Now, you might be thinking to yourself, ""She's crazy, I only need one persons advice"". Well, imagine how much better it would be to look at your situations from different angles. Wouldn't that be pretty nice? By getting multiple peoples inputs, you are also raising your trait of perspective. What is perspective, you ask? Perspective is being able to look at a situation and not just picture one scenario or solution, but multiple. This trait can get you very far in life. An example is if a student applies to colleges, he or she needs to look at multiple reasons to pick that specific school.

Another reason on why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one is because not only will you gain more knowledge about one trait, you'll gain two. The other trait is open mindedness. Have you ever heard someone say, ""You have to be more open minded.""? Well, what they mean by that is that you or whoever they're talking to, has to not be so closed in on one idea. One of my personal experiences, is when I was doing kick boxing. I did kick boxing my whole life and I loved it, but that doesn't mean it's the only sport I can do for the rest of my life. So, I decided to do volleyball too. I did this because I had to be open minded to other sports other than kick boxing.

My last reason is about the people you get advice from. I don't know about you, but I have multiple people in my life who are important, not just one. You probably do too. The people you get you advice from, can be crucial to your decision. I only ask for advice from people I trust such as family, teachers, and my best friend. People you trust and love most likely trust and love you just as much or maybe even more. If they don't want to see you hurt or unsuccessful, they wouldn't give you bad advice. When I need advice, I ask my mom, my grandma, and my best friend. I do this because they all give support to the answers they give me. Also, if it is a ""yes or no"" question, I can use the majority rules system.

In conclusion, asking for advice from multiple people will make the decision more successful than just asking one person. This is because you will learn and gain very important life skills such as perspective and open mindedness, and because you can ask multiple people that you adore and trust. Now tell me, what will you do with your advice next time? Ask one person? Or two? Or maybe even more? Next time, use these examples to think about how many people to ask for advice.                             ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Most of the times I believe that people ask for multiple advice from multiple people because they want their adive to impact them in a certain way. However, sometimes one person cannot be convinced by one voice they like to hear multiple voices to be convinced. Most often people are not motivated by themselves which would make it harder for them to be motivated by a single voice because those people needs to hear multiple opinions to make them better or motivated. So let's say that this one person likes to change his or her life and become more motivated, be in the best shape of his or her life, so he or she ask about 10 people how to get motivated and how to work hard to achieve your dreams. Hearing motivating and powerful words from other people can impact your life without you even knowing.

He gets about the same advice from people as he did from the people before and as he heard all of those people talk about the same topic now he or she would be motivated because sometimes not only one voice but two would put a big impact on someone's life and help them. My teachers, friends, family, and all of the people I've met in my life had gave an advice that I heard and took their advice because it meant something to me and it was deep. I would want more people to give me advice that can impact my life, for example my friend's dad always gives him advises but he has hear his dad tell him the same advice over and over again at the end of the day he will get bored and not listen to his dad's advice which would impact him negatively.

Sometimes life gets hard to certain people and they would like to hear advice from multiple people which will impact them in a positive or a negative way depends on who they ask advice from. For example if I were to ask advice from my brother all the time he would just repeat everything he said from before and that would not help me at all, after all they say ""two brain is better than one.""

Listening to other people's advises can impact you in a way that would make you do the right thing in the future and not only it can impact you it can impact the people around you.

CA92495BE92E,"How seeking multiple opinions can help make the better decisions

Have you ever seeked advice to decide something important to you? Have you ever asked only one person or multiple people? How can seeking for multiple peoples advice make you decide an important decision? Well, I'm here to fufill you with all of these answers. Yes, it is hard to make a very important decision, it also can be stressing, but would it help to ask advice to more than just one person?

The answer is yes, when your trying to find an answer to a decision your about to make, it's better if you ask advice to more than just one person. But why? Because, you can find better advice to your desicion if you ask multiple people instead of one. For example, a few years back my mom asked me, ""Generic_Name, would you like to go to visit your grandparents this summer."" In my head I thought, I could either stay here with my friends to enjoy the summer with them, or I could visit my grandparents for the first time in years, since they lived all the way in another country. So I went to my friend for advice, she said, ""oh come on Generic_Name we will have such a good time if you stay, plus, couldn't you just go next summer?""

Then I thought to myself, I could always go next time, but I still went to my trusted brother, Generic_Name, for advice. As soon as I told him about the desicion I had to make, he told me, ""Generic_Name, you can always hang out with your friends in the summer, but you can only see grandparents once every 2 years, don't think it would be better, well since they are getting old, to see grandparents this summer?"" What he said really made me think about the desicions I was going to make, I learned so much that day. I learned, I had to spent as much time as I possibly can with them, mostly because I can barely see them, and I think I should treasure the moments I still have with them. But that also teaches me that, you should always seek more than one persons advice because, another person could have more knowlodge about the decision your about to make.

They also could be more helpful about it, or some maybe could have gone through the same thing before. Sure, someones advice can be somewhat helpful, but I feel like if you ask multiple people, it can turn your whole aspect about the problem around. But after telling you all of this, I hope it changed yuor way of thinking, now let me ask you a question. Just imagine you need to make a life changing decision in just a matter of time, would you ask one person for their advice, or would you ask multiple people for their advice? Just ask that to yourself, what would the answer be?

Hopefully, it would be to ask multiple people knowing they could be more knowlodge-able than others. But it's okay if you choosed to only ask for one persons advice, sometimes people only count on one specific person for advice, but hear me out. Decisions are made everyday by so many people, some are easier than others, and some are harder than others. But think of it this way, wouldn't be easier if you had help from multiple people, instead of just one? It would be easier, wouldn't it. Heres why, people need help from others if they are going to make the better desicion, you can never just count on one opinion, when you could have many more.

You could ask advice to your family, friends, siblings, or even trusted adults at school, because I'm pretty sure they would be glad to help you the best way they can. You can always count on more than one person to make a decision even if it's a hard one, but the more advice you recieve the better you are at making that decision. Decisions are very hard to make, but it will be easier if you ask more than one person for their opinions on it, they could be more helpful than another, or they could be more expierenced than another. So therefore, it's always better to seek more than one persons advice, than to only seek for only one specific persons advice because, it will help you make the better decisions.  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

If you take advice from just one person its only one outcome, But if you take advice from different people the more outcomes the better because different people give you good advice it will boost your confidence even if it backfires with confidence the different people gave you it wont't affect you that much so it better to take different people for advice.

So if you wanna take someones advice its better to take it from multiple people to get a perspective on how things would go, the more advice you get the more you see into your problem or problems you have.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

The multiple opinion can make better choice by thinking what you didn't thought before. And we can consider advantage and disadvantage based on their experience,knowledge,and environment.

People can decide the view of the opinion based on person's experience and person who asked a question will have opportunity to consider about all opinion to make better choice. Each person has different experience. And they use their experience to decide the best choice. For example if person wants to do bungi jump and ask people whether to do or not. And if the person whose answering this question had tried bungi jump and felt that it's fun,that person will say it was fun so do it. But if the person whose answering this question saw the news about accident while bungi jumping,that person will say it's dangerous so don't do it.

People has different opinion based on their knowledge and the person who asked the question,will have opportunity to consider about the safest choice. Each person has different knowledge. And and based on the their knowledge,people decide whether the opinion is appropriate or not. For example if the person went to mountain and found the mushrooms. And he or she was very hungry,he or she asked to people whether to eat or not. And if the person whose answering the question don't know about the mushrooms,will say you can eat it. And if the person whose answering this question knows well about mushroom cause he was interested about it,will say they might be poisonous so don't eat it.

People consider different things based on their environment and the person who asked the question,will have opportunity to decide which is the best choice. Each person has different environment that they are living. And environment can make opinion that are the best and also for the future. For example,if the person wants to buy a expensive item so he or she asked to people whether buy or not. And if the person whose answering this question was having allowance every month from their parents,will say buy it because you wanted and your parents will give allowance next month. And if the person whose answering this question are working by him or her selves to earn money,will say no because you need to save it for the future.

So the multiple opinion will help someone to make better choice by all different people's experiences,knowledge,and environment. And help someone to consider with more opinions that help to think more deeper.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Advice can come from anyone, in any form. This variety makes advice a unique tool in the situation of making a tough decision. Advice can come from a single person, or a plethora of people. Acquiring advice from multiple people, rather than just one, can help someone make a better and more intelligent choice. Seeking advice from multiple opinions is a great thing to do because of the variety of knowledge and experience of people, different points of views, and the ability to check the different ideas obtained and come up with a central idea of advice.

Seeking advice from multiple opinions is going to be different from each person. The variety of knowledge and experience each person has will determine the advice they give. The amount of knowledge or experience each person has accounts for the value and trustworthiness their opinions have. Trustworthiness in advice is key to making a decision. The more knowledge and experience a person has on a problem or situation, the more their advice and opinions can be respected, accepted, and trusted. Seeking multiple opinions for advice can help someone make a trustworthier choice. Also, the wisdom each person has is determined by their knowledge and experience. Without wisdom, advice wouldn't be trustworthy. The best advice is given by the wisest people. The wiser the opinion is of a person, the wiser and more trustworthy their advice would be. Obtaining advice from multiple opinions can help someone determine the most trustworthy and wise advice, and therefore, make a better choice.

The different points of views everyone has is the reason everyone has different opinions. The uniqueness of everyone's opinion is why advice varies from person to person. The variety of opinions and points of views of multiple people can help someone make a better choice after seeking advice. Since advice varies from each person, seeking multiple opinions can give someone multiple reasons to make a decision. Some opinions will be the same too. If opinions are the same, then making an intelligent choice will be much easier. The popularity of an opinion can determine how much weight it will carry when someone is making a decision. When searching for advice, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because the different points of views of people determine how common a piece of advice is. The more common a piece of advice is, the better it can help someone make a choice.

Seeking multiple opinions for advice can help someone come up with a central idea to make a better decision in a situation. Gathering multiple ideas to form a main one is an extremely great way for someone to make a better choice. The various opinions people have can check other peoples advice and determine if it's reliable. Seeking multiple opinions can help find which ideas that match, and which ones are way out of place. Using this information, someone could come up with a central piece of advice which will assist them in making a better choice. Someone could also add up the most reliable or common pieces of advice, and use all of them to help in making a better decision. Using multiple opinions to come up with a central piece of advice, can help someone to make an intelligent and more reliable choice.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. The variety of knowledge and experience of people can determine which opinions are trustworthy, and which ones are not. The different points of views people have can help find the most reliable opinions. Finally, to be able to check other ideas and come with a central idea of advice.

4FF5D3885FD4,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. They may think that just one opinion isnt enough and want variety rather than one or two opinions for advice. The person may also be open to suggestions if they dont know what to pick and need more options.

As they say, ""variety is the spice of life"" and that could very well be helpful when making decisions. Having variety in decisions usually helps to narrow down choices. Variety also sometimes is a lifesaver when making a decision. Variety is normally a very common resource that is found quite often.

Multiple viewpoints from other people or their suggestions usually help for when someone wants to know another persons' point of view. Other peoples ideas usually help with decisions sometimes, or at the least people can start from there onward. Negative and positive viewpoints also help construct criticism that is usually important for a person when they need feedback on a viewpoint or an idea to help decide something.

Influence from peers or friends almost always influences someone whether it's realized or not. Making decisions is also affected by influence whether good or bad it still helps someone to make a decision. Influence is usually vital to making a decision.

9F0900A01266,"If we only ask one person what his or her opinion is on something then you won't see the whole picture and this may lead to mistakes and embarasment. These things happen but can be avoided if you just ask ""what do you think"" to multiple people, enough that you can produce an answere that has the best results. We as humans are not perfect so we need to have good skills and knowlege before action is taken, and viewing the opinion of others is a great way of understanding.

It's always importent to seek multiple views so you can get all the pros and cons of them, which can help you make a decision with the most advantage. It can widen what you know on the subject leading to more information on which you can use to answere other questions. If you're unsure, asking others for their opinion can help clear up confusion if not much is known on your subject, helping you understand and make an accurate view or opinion. Imagin two kids got in a fight over who is the best rock and roll band, in this situation you would decide the winner, so you would listen to both sides and off the information choose. Other peoples opinion may make you want to try new things and they may push you to aim higher then before.

If you hear only one answere you might start to assume things that are wrong and in some cases can lead to hurt feelings and broken bonds. This is why we need to find opinions from multiple people, to create a more precise view. Having more opinions backing your side can help you in case you need to pursuade someone to decide. Assuming can create something called a single story, a single story is something that is a view with one sides opinion without the others on a subject and most of the time are false. Maybe one day you wanted to go eat some pizza, you ask your friend and he tells you that this one pizza place is really good and the other is bad, so you trust him and don't bother to ask other people and go on to think that one pizza place is bad and never try to eat at it.

Getting multiple thoughts on anything can help you remove bias on the subject and change your point of view for the better. It can have a lasting effect on your view and learning skills, it can also increase your knowlege, which can prevent a bias from forming all increasing better decision making. Asking them their opinion is helpfull and can clear up confusion that might have been an embarasing question to ask. Lets go back to the pizza place example but now your other friends are telling you that this pizza place (The one you thought was bad) is pretty good pizza for how cheap it is. You try the pizza and you like it and change your mind about it, now you eat at it all the time with your friends.

In the end this is not a perfect solution, the people around you might have a bias on the subject or have false information that you might start to believe. In life you will make bad decisions eitheir because of bias or miscommunication, but you will eventually bump into a person who has a different opinion on a subject and maybe even pursuade you to switch in a good way, changing the way you may have been thinking on some decisions. This is why it's importent not to only understand both sides of an argument but also to practice theses skills for later in life for more knowlege and skill to be better at decision making.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
6A652ADDA9B3,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This can help them make a better choice in many different ways. Discussing decisions with different people, not only gives the decision maker multiple perspectives to think about, but it also can help them gain confidence in their decision, and give them enriching new ideas to think about. All of these resources for the decision maker, will help them to make an educated and well thought out choice. With the opinions and thoughts of many people involved in a choice, the decision maker also makes a well rounded decision, that will positively impact themselves, as well as other people.

To start, every person has something to offer, and different people have different perspectives. While making a decision, many people may become stuck in their own perspective, and receiving advice from multiple people may offer a refreshing chance to look at the situation differently. If you only take advice from one person, their perspective has less of a chance of being varied from that of yourself, than if you get advice from numerous different people. This will help the decision maker to see the decision in a different light, and this may clear up any uncertainties for them. For example, you may view a color, and be absolutely sure that it is blue. However, if you ask another person, they may be certain that the same color is actually green. This shows, that different people can view the same situation in a different way. Furthermore, speaking with more than just one person, may help you to get an understanding of how the decision may have repercussions on other people, instead of just thinking about yourself. Hearing these different perspectives, may convince the decision maker to make a better choice, than if they had just spoken to one person.

Subsequently, seeking advice from more than one person, may help the decision maker to feel more confident about their decision. While speaking to other people, they may find that a good number of people feel the same way that they do about their choice. This will help them to feel more confident in their good decision, and they will be less likely to change their mind. An example of this same concept is in science experiments. In a science experiment, scientists always run multiple trials of the same experiment. This is so that they feel confident about their results. This is the same idea as having multiple people who have the same opinion as you do; you feel more confident about your resulting choice. If a scientist does not get matching results, then they feel that their results are invalid, and they run the experiment again. This is the same as if you do not find people who have the same opinion as you, and you rethink your decision. If you thought you had made up your mind, and then you speak to more people who have different opinions, you are more likely to rethink your choice. This will help you make sure that you are truly making the best choice for yourself.

Finally, the ideas of other people may help you to formulate your own. While everyone has their own perspective to give, they also have their own ideas. Everybody brings something new to the table, and if you talk to more people, you can hear more ideas. These ideas may convince you to think a certain way about your choice, or they may help you unlock some of your own ideas. Either a new opinion, or a new idea, may be exactly what a decision maker needs to finalize their decision, or make a completely new choice. These new ideas, may also help the decision maker to understand the decision at hand, in a more fundamental way, which will help them to understand the impact of their choices. This, can lead to a carefully made choice.

In conclusion, seeking the advice of numerous people offers many thoughtful benefits that lead the decision maker to the best possible decision. New and different perspectives on a specific decision, will help the decision maker to understand how the decision may not only affect them, but how it will also affect other people. This may also help the decision maker to get out of their head, and look at the situation from a different angle. Hearing opinions from numerous people, may also help you gain confidence in your decision, and if it does not, you will know that you may need to give your choice more thought. Finally, every new person that you speak to, will give you more ideas that may influence your decision. These ideas may shape your decision in ways that you never would have thought about, had you not spoken to more than one person. These ideas and opinions also may give you a new sense of clarity over your choice. Overall, seeking the advice of multiple people, instead of just one, will help decision makers to make choices that are well thought out, thoroughly planned, and best for not only themselves, but for other people as well. ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
F6E6BF805605,"Everyone seeks advice, whether it be from friends, family, or even strangers, but how does getting this advice from a variety of people benefit someone and their choice? When a person is lost for what to do, they may seek guidance from people they trust. Advice is an important part of our lives and can greatly affect our decision-making process. This is because if a person trusts another person, they will likely trust what they say as well and take it to heart. When making a decision, getting the opinions of multiple people will likely improve that decision because you are gathering advice that comes from a multitude of different experiences and backgrounds, and seeking multiple opinions will prevent quite a bit of bias.

A choice is benefited by getting advice from multiple people because every person has a different background, thought-process, perspective, and their own experiences. This is because these experiences could have been similar to the one a person needs advice for. That person would have been through that situation before, so they'd know how to handle it. They could know the consequences and benefits in a side of that choice and tell them to the person making the choice, allowing them to weigh these benefits and consequences in order to make their decision. A person's background may shape their perspective on things to be different than another person's. Seeking advice from someone with a different perspective than yourself could open your eyes to something that you hadn't thought of or realized prior to receiving their advice. Also, a person seeking advice may be a more emotional thinker, but the situation that they need advice for doesn't suit the thought-process of a more emotional person, so they could seek the advice of someone with a different thought-process that fits giving advice on the situation better.

Talking to multiple people for advice will also prevent a large quantity of bias. The people that are being asked for advice may not be a part of the situation, thus giving them a clearer head when discussing the problem and giving their opinion. If parts of a decision are largely agreed upon, then they are likely no longer made from nearly as much bias because the people giving advice all have their own unique beliefs and ideas, yet all agree on those things. If a person were to seek advice from both a friend and someone they're just on good terms with, they will be able to pick out the bias while also picking up the similarities between the two opinions, thus giving the person a better idea of what to do. This is because a person can have bias coming from their relationship with the person needing advice. If they like the person, their opinion on a choice will likely be more optimistic and uplifting towards them, but their opinion could be a bit unrealistic or skewed in favor of the person because of this. If a person were to dislike a person seeking advice, they may be more pessimistic and unsupportive towards the person, which could mean their opinion could go the other way and be a bit skewed against the person. So, by seeking opinions from both of these, a neutral perspective, or just people with more positive or negative views on things, a person making a choice can have much more information and views to go off of when they make it.

Whether it be to remove bias from an issue or to gain the knowledge and perspectives of a multitude of backgrounds, it is clear that seeking multiple opinions helps a person in making a better choice. Things that are largely agreed upon will likely contain less bias, so seeking advice from multiple people will reduce the bias coming from someone's involvement in a situation or their relationship to the person needing advice. Less bias will allow for a more clearheaded choice. A multitude of perspectives and backgrounds allows many differing opinions on a subject, and some people may be more suited to giving advice on a situation because of their thought-process or past experiences. This makes the advice more reliable to follow.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because that person will learn from their mistakes, someone else's advice could be beneficial in the future, and the advice you receive you can use to help others.

When you seek advice from others, you can sometimes learn from your mistakes. When you fail at something, just ask a companion or family member for some help.

When they tell you what you can do, just use that advice and you will never mess up again. But, if their advice doesn't work just don't use it. At the point where their advice doesn't work, just ask someone else for their opinion.

If someone gives you advice, you should use it for the future. Another person's opinion on something could be beneficial later on in life. If your friend gives you really helpful advice, use should use it the next time you have that problem. That's what I do in most situations. Your friend's advice will be so memorable that you will never forget it.

Every time you get advice from someone, you should try to remember it. Later on in life you can give that advice to someone else. Besides, helping others is a good thing to do. For instance, if you come up on a problem that you cannot fix and someone tells you how to fix it you should remember that. Then, if you see someone struggling with the same problem, help them out.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions from others is a good thing. Their advice helps me all the time.

First getting more than one advice from someone help's them make a better decision because they know what advice they need and what they don't need. Second receiving advice from more than one can make you combine all of the advice's together to make one big advice.

While getting advice from one person is great, Receiving advice from more than one person is beneficial.

When you receive multiple advice's you can combine all their advice's to get one big advice that summarizes all the advice's you were given. When you get advice from someone it connects to things such as, School, Sports, Jobs,and many more. When you get advice it's to motivate your self to do more.

38043B171DAC,"I think going to somone else for another option because it gives differnt views, it helps puts heads together, and the other person can give advice on a situation. 60% more men commite suicide than women do. Thats because men don't share their feelings or anything to anyone.

Getting a differen't view on a situation is very importaint. Another person can look at it in a positive way while you look at it in a negetive way. Looking at it in a good way can make the situation so much better for you and anyone who is imvolved in it. if that other person can make you think positive that it can take so much stress off your body and so many other people around you. For example If your kid puts ramon noodles in the microwave wihout any water than it catches on fire but he diden't burn the house down then just focuse of the bright side. The house is still in great condition and its not burned down.

Second, reason I think people ask for other options on a situation so they can put their heads together. More heads works better than just one head dealing with that situation. More people's options on it can make you think/ look at it in a whole diffen't stand point. You can ask for someone's option and you might treally not agree with you on it but they might have a really good reason and facts to prove their option. For example if one of your friends calls you about the math homework and you both don't know what to do then you can put your heads together and try to figure it out.

Finally, Giving advice can go both ways in a heated situation between anything. You can give someone advice o how there doing in math like you saw their math test score and you give them advice on how to study. They cantake that so far and think you think they're dumb or stupid. Or you can give someone advice about their relashonship. If they have never been in a relashionship before tell them the basics or how to treat a girl right or just anything good that helps build a good relationship with their partner. For example if your best friend comes to you for advice on how to make a girl happy or atleast show her that you love her or atleast care about her than you need to tel him how to do that because it might be his first one or no girl has treated him right and he's scared to love someone again.

In conclution, Going to someone for mulitiple options can be bad or can be good. Giving someone advice,more options on a decion or more views on a decions can really help someone thats stressed out about it. Help smeone who comes to you for help it means a lot to them.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
9252D20095BE,"Have you ever thought of asking more than one person for advice? There are multiple reasons why you should. You should always talk to a smarter person because they can know more facts. You can see of different people have the same opinion as you. Someone could be wrong and you could have asked the wrong person and given you false information. You should get more opinions because it's smart to have more and you can't just rely on one opinion it can totally wrong.

My first reason is that you should ask the smarter person because they know more. You can't go up to a random dude on the street and ask him about your college work he might know nothing about it. You should go to your professor and ask him or her how should I go with this and how would it make me better at it. In sports you shouldn't go to basketball coach and ask him how to go when swimming a 100 freestyle he wouldn't know how to. This goes with my second reason that you can get false information like asking a random person again what is 5 to the second power and he could say 10 but if u ask a teacher it is actually 25.

The third reason is that always get other peoples opinion like if you are asking how to deal with a newborn you can ask a family member who has already had a kid before and ask how they took care of it. Doctors are a great use of asking that kind of information and using real websites that are approved by real doctors and specialist. Another good reason is to get more than one opinion because you cant just think one pearson is right they could have a good way but always ask someone else to see if they have the same opinion as you. I personally think you should multiple people because it would like to get more and different ways on how to do something. It lets me have different ways so that if I don't like one of the ways someone tells me to do I can have different ones and see if I like them.

So in conclusion you should always ask different people for advice not just one. Because you can get false information. You can't rely on one pearson and see if people have the same opinion as you. Always find the smarter pearson to talk to not some random weird guy of the street who says he knows everything. These are some good reasons to why you should always ask other people for their opinion for advice.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Seeking advice in the first place can give you a different view on the problem you are trying to solve. But seeking multiple opinions will give you perspectives from all angles. Thus, you will know how it will affect you and other people. Seeking advice from people can also tell you what not to do. If they have been in that same situation before, they can tell you what worked and what didn't work for them. This could give you an idea of what you should try and what you shouldn't try. Seeking opinions helps people make better choices.

For example, if Generic_Name wanted to know how she was going to build a bridge, she wouldn't just consult herself. This would leave out input and opinions from other people. She would consult with other people. She would consult with engineers, the community, pedestrians, and environmentalists for opinions. She would consult with an engineer so she would know what made up a sturdy bridge. She would consult with the community because they would be the ones driving over the bridge. They would also help her decide how many lanes would be on the bridge. She would also consult pedestrians because if they wanted to walk over the bridge, there should be a special walkway so they don't get run over. And lastly, she would consult environmentalists so she would have the least amount of impact on animal habitats and wildlife. In order to fully understand building a bridge, she would have to consult with many different people. After concerns were brought up, she would try to attack them from all angles. It would be easier on her because she would know the concerns of the community and how it will affect them. After talking with the engineer, she would know a sturdy design and to implement it she would need advice of a construction company. After Generic_Name is done building the bridge, she will be very knowledgeable because she consulted with so many different groups and parties.

Thus, seeking advice can help you make better decisions. It can give you multiple perspectives on the problem. Then you will know how to attack the focus from all angles. It will also give you good advice on what works. Seeking advice can help people make better choices. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
F45847241E48,"My grandpa said once ""you'll get better advice if you listen to more people."" And that's why I say it's best to seek multiple people when search for advice. Other reasons I say this are: other people have different points of view than you, other people have gained wisdom as well, and strangers give unfiltered advice. Now I'll explain my other reasons.

The best advice comes from people with different points of view, and other people have wildly different points of view than you, that's because the vast majority of the world has had different experiences than you, which changes you're point of view a lot. And even if you've been to the same place as someone, a location can change over the course of many years meaning that you'll each have a very different experiences, yet again altering their point of view. Depending on your prior experiences, if you were to have the same experience as someone, you might take the experience's meaning differently.

Don't forget, you're not the only one that has asked and received advice. People's points of view have been influenced by their families. And advice is mostly given by friends and family, and other people have different families and friend groups. If someone lived in another place and time some advice given to them may not be relevant to you right now, but it may be relevant in your future, so it's best to listen regardless. Advice changes over the years by many people as they see fit, as the advice gets tweaked by the passing of generation to generation.

It might be a good idea to ask strangers for advice, as strangers have the most different points of view than you. Most of the people you know have probably had roughly some of the same experiences as you, while strangers will usually have the most different experiences than anyone you know. Since strangers have this original point of view strangers would give an original take on things, and give you advice you probably haven't heard yet. And it's harder for a stranger to purposely give bad advice because out of all people, the probably have the least to gain by giving you bad advice.

That's whyit's best to seek multiple people when search for advice. to restate my reasons they are: other people have different points of view than you, other people have gained wisdom as well, and strangers give the most original advice. So hopefully this paper help you realize why it's good to seek other people for advice, and encourages you to do so.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
E2FCF4124BCE,"Why is seeking other peoples opinion can help someone make a better a choice? Seeking for one persons opinion is not a choice, it's an advice that could be right or wrong so you could just take it or loose it. Don't get me wrong I believe people and friends have good advice but sometimes you just need to think if it's the right advice for you, depends on what problem you have.

However, with multiple people you can listen on what they think and from what there saying you instantly can tell if it's a right or wrong choice, and the person needs to know what position your going through so they can help you out. With one person it's hard to choose who your going to talk to cause not everyone has the best nor the worst advice or solutions. When it comes to different personality's it also comes with different result's and it's shocking to hear other peoples opinion when it's way far different from the others, I think that's why it's better to have more then one opinion cause as your listening on what there saying it's it's almost like being in the person's mind and seeing a different type of perspective.

I think having multiple people with multiple opinions can help a lot, because a lot of people could have the same experience that you had before, but if they did not then that's something different but I also think it's based on the person who is giving you advice, for an example if you had a funny or silly friend who is always your best pal but yet you come across a situation that is serious and you come to them for advice and they still act kind a funny with it I would say that's not the best person to come to, but if it was a more serious and chill type of friend I would go to them to get the best result but that's just me. Again not everyone has a best answer but what you hear off of them can help you make the better choice.

In conclusion having more then one opinion is the best way to help you out in any situation cause listening to other peoples opinion it's like your seeing from there point of view on how would they handle it and just by sorting it out from the wrong to the rights you can make your way to a better answer.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
4DC0660FD777,"People often get stuck in serious situations, where they have to make important decisions. They usually get advice from more than one person. People may ask for advice from more than one person because, you can get more help finding the best outcome,and you get to look at at the situation from another point of view.

When you get advice from more than one person, you can find a great outcome in a much easier way. For example, "" I facetime my best friend and my cousin and say, "" I need help with finding something to wear to school tomorrow."" My cousin says I should wear a skirt because it's cute and very trendy, but my best friend said I should wear my new overalls because, it's cold outside and and they could be the new 2020 trend.

I took my time to compare the outcome and then i made my decision. "" When you want two different things you can ask others to help make the decision.

Another reason why it's good to get advice from more than one person is that you can look at the situation from another point of view. For example, two of my friends see why the choice you're making is right and my other friends can see why it's wrong. I think to myself about how the point of view is different and which one I think can have the best outcome. You'll realize the differences in the outcome and make the best decision.

As you can see, when you get advice from multiple people, you're going to get the best option.

Advice from other people can help you get through things that you can't get through alone. As the old saying says ""Two heads are always better than one.""",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
56671797633F,"People go to multiple opinions for advice so they can really find the right decision to make.

So they don't just go off the top of their head.

Like you say you are going to do something then you ask your friends if you should do it and they all say no you shouldnt do that you're most likely arent going to do it anymore. Not asking for adive could lead to bad decions made.

You can also go to multiple opinions to see how you can change something like your jumpshot or your position you play in football. You ask people how you can change so to see how you can get better at your sport or whatever it is you are trying to improve. Advice is really good in sports because you can learn how to get faster, stronger ex. That gives that of step ahead of all the other poeple playing the sport you are playing. Say im asking for advice on how to get faster and all the other people on your team are just doing the same thing at practice asking no questions and your the on trying to get better, it gives you that extra step ahed of them.

Multiple opinions to see which person gives you the best advice and is reliable. You go to a friend for advice but you dont really like what they are saying you got to another people but they say the same thing. So you start asking a buch of people trying find that one person that gives you really good advice and is realible and trustworthy. That one person that you can go to for anything and they know exactly what to say everytime. That person tells what to say to a girl you are trying to get a girl, tells you how to cope with stress and a lot more things.

You have a presentation coming up and your really nervous and you havent even thought of what your going to say. So you go to your friends for some advice and They give you tips on how to destress and they help you think you what to say. The day comes and you are very anxious and stressed so you use the techinques you friends tought you and you end up doing very well on you speech and it was all thanks to my friends.

4E7557A13281,"Have you ever been stuck in a position where you need advice? Then even when you may get advice from someone and it seems helpful, it ends up not getting you anywhere. Getting advice from a lot people rather than just one or two could really help your situation a lot. First of all it provides more healthy opinions to your decision on how you go about your problem. Second you are then able to compare and contrast the opinions you are given to find what works best. And finally you get a wider range of thoughts and points of view that will open up your mind to more ways of fixing this problem.

When you are provided with more than one or two opinions it leads you to being able to decifer the right from wrong and what your next move is. Sometimes you will receive an opinion that is totally different from the others. This is actually extremely helpful and would help you open up your mind and realize more ways to go about your issue. One other thing that may happen is someone may tell you something that is against what others have been telling you. For example if most people tell you to talk to a trusted adult, and then this one person says to only rely on your friends. Then you may realize that not everyone you talk to knows what they are saying. My final example is the chance that if people are talking to you as if what they say are facts, sometimes you may need to double check on that stuff. Receiving more than one opinion works somewhat like a fact checker and helps you realize if someone may be telling you false so called ""facts"". Being provided with multiple opinions not only allows you to open up your mind it will really show you the right advice from the wrong advice. With only one opinion you wouldn't be able to recognize these things as easily.

Having multiple advisors allows you to compare and contrast the advice you obtain. If it seems like there is repeats or everyone is saying the same thing, then go with that thing that is repeated. When the majority think that it is the best possible solution there's a good chance it actually is the best possible solution. Another thing that may happen is the advice may go back and forth and you are getting a lot of both sides or both opinions. Then in this case you can see which side has more experienced people giving you that opinion. For example lets say I am doing a school project and want to figure out how to organize it. Would I use my two younger siblings advice even though they have never done this type of school work, or would I take advice from my parents and older sibling who have experience. The answer is obvious, even though there are almost an even amount of people on both sides, you stick with who has experience. Finally my favorite way of using comparing and contrasting the advice. If you have a bunch of different opinions and none of them really match up or there are no patterns and repeats, you get to make it. In this case you can pick and pull parts from all the advice and build your own advice for yourself based off of other people's ideas. Being able to compare and contrast the advice you receive gives you a big advantage on how you want to deal with your issue.

You would receive more than one point of view by doing this and therefor a wider range of ideas. This completely opens up your mind to may ways to go about this. You are no longer stuck to just your own point of view. This can also get you to act on your problem in a more creative way. This happens because when you are opened up to so many points of view it lets you be basically unrestricted in problem solving ideas. One other thing that goes along with this advantage is that you could lead to an invention. Inventions are just ways to get around a problem in life. When we receive multiple points of view like this is opens up our creativity and problem solving to a wider array of options. One of those options could be something totally new, which would be an invention. Receiving multiple points of view and a wider range of ideas is in my opinion the best part of getting advice from more than one person. That is because it can lead to so many good ways of fixing your problem and opening up your mind to realize new ways of solving your issue.

Getting advice from multiple people rather than one person proves to have a massive advantage. It leads you to a larger supply of opinions which help you narrow down your options. It allows you to compare your pieces of advice which leads to the best most specific way of dissolving your crisis. And last it provides with you with an open eye or a larger point of view on how you would like you fix this. In my opinion if you do not try to receive more than five versions of advice from others, then you are going about it the wrong way.         ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
678504F90802,"Have you ever asked a friend or family member an important question? Have they ever given you an answer that gave you a far from ideal output? Nobody is always right, and many are far from being so. When you need advice on a subject, asking more than one person is always beneficial, because nobody is always correct, and it helps play to the human nature of skepticism and truth-seeking.

Firstly, one must get advice from more than one person because it helps to weed out the truth. In ancient times, people used to think that the earth was flat, and that the sun orbited the earth. This was, of course, inherently wrong, and eventually disproven by astronomers. But we would still believe those things today, if everybody blindly followed other's advice. Instead, these astronomers pushed through the cries of heresy to find the truth. They were skeptics. Speculation and skepticism breed creativity and the need for truth, two essential facets of human existance. You may think that this is getting a bit off-topic, but it actually mirrors the topic at hand. We must be skeptical of others advice, for taking bad advice can be extremely detrimental. And what better way to find the truth than to find a collection of them, and pull from that the correct thing to do? A person should get advice from different people, because it plays to the natural human trait of skepticism, which has long been found to be the pathway to truth. But this isnt the only reason one should gather the advice of more than one person.

In the times of the Oregon trail, there was a family that wanted to go west, to find new land to settle on. Most people at the time would go on the Oregon trail, a mapped trail to get to the west. But a family friend told them that he knew a guide who had a much better, easier route. The guide took them about halfway through this 'route', and then informed them that he would have to head back, as he had more groups to take. Shortly thereafter, the trail became much harder. They had to abandon their horse and wagon, and eventually, winter caught up with them. Stuck in a cabin they had found, with no food or water, the family perished. This is only a heavily abridged version of the true story, as the full tale is much more gruesome. The moral, perhaps, is that even people you trust can give you bad, if well-meaning, advice. It is doubted that the family friend even knew how unrepputable the guide was, but he still gave them the advice that eventually led to their deaths. Sometimes, people think that they give good advice, but unbenownst to them, the advice isn't so good at all. If the family had asked more people, they might have lived through that fatal winter.

To recap, to get the best opinion on something, one must ask multiple people, as a single person may be wrong. if you are given multiple possible solutions, then you can find the best one and go with it. The author implores you, next time you are having a tough time making a decision, to ask multiple people, to do research on the solutions given, and to not die in a cabin in the dead of winter.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Do you like to talk to multiple people to seek advice? Well, if you do then, seeking advice from people is a better choice. Want to know why, read and find out. Talking to multiple people for advice is a better choice because you can see different perspectives from different people, have inspiration for new ideas, and combine all the advice that was given.

One good thing about asking advice from multiple people is to see different ways they express the advice. Asking multiple people for advice can give different results because they all are different people. I asked my friends for advice and they agave me different advice. People you are choosing to ask for advice can be positive of negative. When I was asking for advice they weren't all positive or negative there were some positive and some negative. While you are asking multiple people for advice they could be honest about it. While I was choosing to ask for advice to my friends they were very honest and they were themselves when they gave me advice. Asking multiple people for advice can be seen in a variety ways.

Another reason why asking multiple people for advice is you can have inspiration from the advice given. When people give advice you can be inspired by it. When I ask for someones for advice, I was very inspired by their words. While your asking multiple people for advice they could be motivational. When my friend gave me advice it felt very motivational. When you were asking for advice from multiple people their advice could be very important for them and yourself. I asked classmates for advice for a project and their advice was very important for the project. Asking multiple people for advice can be very inspiring.

Finally, you asked advice from multiple people people, you have so much advice now. What are you going to do with it? One thing you can do with it is write it all out. when I wrote all of the advice it really helped. Another thing you could do is combined all your advice to make it stronger. My classmates told me a lot of advice for a project, so I combined all of the advice for the project. Lastly, you can talk about the advice with a peer. I talked about all the advice I got with a peer. I talked with a peer about all the advice I got. Working through all the advice is a good idea for good advice.

Talking to multiple people for advice is a good idea because you can find different ways to solve your problem.

485D52DB2024,"When it comes to asking for advice, having more than one opinion is always helpful because, everyone is different and unique, not everyone has your best interest in mind, and because its an opportunity to hear new ideas that you might not have thought of before.

To start off, having multiple opinions is always good because society is so diverse nowadays, meaning that everyone is different. For example, some people are more knowledgeable in certain fields than others might be. If you were to ask a dietitian what you could do to lose weight, they'd more than likely know more about the topic than the sibling of your childhood friend.

Similarly, everyone has had different experiences in life. You wouldn't be able to ask a child what paying taxes is like, or, for that matter, what it feels like to purchase your first house. This is because they haven't had the same experiences as an adult might.

Another thing to take into consideration is that everyone has different views on life, because, as stated, society is so diverse now, everyone comes from a different religion, or has had different upbringings, thus, they have different opinions. This is a good thing because if everyone all had the same opinions and views on life, asking for advice would be pointless to begin with as you'd get the same answer over and over again.

Secondly, not everyone has your best interest in mind. Unfortunately, not everyone is a good influence. If you were to ask someone for advice on how to quit smoking, maybe asking an addict isn't the best idea, instead, you should go to someone who has fully recovered, as they'd better influence you.

Something else you should keep in mind is jealousy. Jealousy can persuade people into saying some nasty things that they may not exactly mean. You shouldn't ever let anyone else put you down for something that you feel is right.

Although there is a lot of good in the world, there will always be some people who want you to fail in life. It's important to not let hurtful opinions get to you, and its best to listen to the ones who are helping you strive for success. Learning to let go of toxic relationships is a good skill to learn, and one you should hold onto for a lifetime.

Another thing you should consider is that multiple opinions means more ideas! When you put two heads together, you can come up with more ideas than just one would be able to. Something that comes with more ideas are more things to consider, and more things to consider means you have that many more opportunities to find the best option for you.

Finally, an important thing to consider is that asking multiple people for advice can teach you how to ask for help, and how to accept the opinions of others and learn from it. Knowing how to ask for help is important, as not everyone can do everything all by themselves.

To sum it up, seeking multiple opinions is important when asking for advice because everyone is different, not everyone is a good influence, and because it means you get to hear new ideas.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
141A60AB7B0D,"When it comes to making a choice it can be hard, don't worry others can help. Don't be too overwelmed because your peers will lead the way. Getting other people's advice is key to getting the best outcome. I know personally I look up to my peers for advice. Here's how it can help you make the best choice.

First, your peers know you. Most of your close friends and family have known you for awhile. Your family sees the way you work and truly knows all about you. It's important to get advice from them because they will help you make the best choice. Others also see you from a different point of view so it's not all about the way you see yourself. They watch you go about life and they'll know if it's the right choice for you. You also have a bond and trust with the people you talk to. They would never lie or let you down. If they knew it wasn't right for you they would stop you before making that choice. It's important to trust those that you go to, they should be honest and trustworthy. Family and friends know your lifestyle and would let you know if that choice wouldn't be right for your life. Getting advice from others that know you well is one way to make the best choice.

Secondly, your peers that you go to have experience. Everyone has had to make a choice. Whether it was small or something very important they can still help. Anyone from siblings to teachers are always open to talk with you. I have an older sister and she helps me out a lot because she's experienced similar situations. For example school, she's been through more grades than me, she really is someone with experience to help me out. Going to others that are older works well for me. Like my parents, they've raised me and have been through more than I have. They've experienced a lot and have been in my shoes. I can always count on them for advice. Friends are also great for advice, you have a bond and can truly relate to their life. Family and friends care for you, they wouldn't let you make the wrong choice. It's also smart to go to others because there experience might've not been well. So it's better to go to them so you don't get yourself into a bad position. Going to family and friends with experience is another way to make the best choice.

Lastly, your peers will help you and guide you to the best choice. Never make a choice right away, it can lead to a bad experience. You never known what your getting into. Especially go to your parents, they need to agree with your decision. Even if you think it's right others may not. It can be hard sometimes because everyone has there own opinion. At first your peers may disagree but that's why it's so important to talk things out. In the end it's about compromise and that can result in the best thing for you. When asking for advice others might have other ideas. Always let them share with you because it could be better for you. Like I mentioned earlier others have experience. So it's very important because they will help you. Family and friends will always guide you to what's right, so trust them. Talking things through always makes me feel better because decisions can be stressful. Letting others talk you through it will guide you to the best choice.

In conclusion, it's very important to go to others for advice. They know you, they are experienced, and will guide you through it. Going to others will truly give you the best outcome and will be less stressful for you. Next time you have to make a decision definitely talk to your peers because they will help you make the best choice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

Another reason why asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice is because advice from more than one person gives you more advice to think about. Getting advice from more then one person is a better choice because you have multiple options, it can be hard to get from only one person, and it gives you more then one idea.

Asking more than one person for advice can help them make a better choice because they have multiple options to choose from. Having multiple options can help someone make a better choice because they might not agree with someone. It could also help someone because they could choose one that they like and dislike because they have multiple options to choose from. For example if I needed advice for high school and I ask multiple people, I could choose which advise I liked the most. Another example would be If I needed advice on how to get good grades at school and I ask multiple people if I don't agree on what someone else said I could agree with someone else and take their advice.

Advice can be hard to get from only one person because you need to get other people's advice on what you need advice on. Another reason why advice can be hard to get from one person is because you also need to get more than one persons opinion. For example if I ask my friend for advice and she gives advice and I don't like it, I would go to someone else because I didn't like the advice she gave to me. Another example would be if I ask someone for advice and they give it to me and I don't like it I would go to someone else. That is why it's important to get advice from more than one person because you might have not liked the advice someone gave to you so you go to another person.

Getting advice from more then one person gives you more advice ideas to think about. For example if I ask someone for advice and I ask someone else and they both give me great advice I can have two advice to think about. Another example would be I ask multiple people for advice and they give me advice and I like both of the advice multiple advice to think about. Getting more then one opinion can help someone make a better choice because they have more then one advice to think about and they can choose which advice they like the most. Getting advice give you more ideas to think about.

Advice can be hard to choose from, but asking multiple people can make it easy because you have different options to choose from. Sometimes when people give you advice you might not agree with them, but the more people you ask the more advice you get, and the more advice you can choose from.

D9A9EEDB9D0C,"Someone asked me for my opinion on a problem she was having the other day and well I gave it to her, but after I saw her go up to two other people and ask same thing and I felt like I didnt give the right answer, couple days go by and she comes up to me and says my advice worked! I asked her ""how many people did you talk to"" she said ""4 I took bits of what everyone told me and used it"". I think you should ask 3-5 people there opinion on a problem. That way you get more advice and more ways to resolve whatever your looking to resolve,even if you tell your close friend about the problem and there advice doesnt help at least you know you have someone that'll talk with you, also if you ask for advice and it doesnt solve the problem you have to ask more people and tell the first person there advice didnt help.

If you have a problem ask! if you need advice on something ask 3-5 people for there opinion that way you get multiple sources telling you things that may help you make a better choice. Take cooking as an example Gordon Ramsey had 4 mentors to get where he is today if he didnt have all 4 who knows what kind of chef he'd be today. When you ask 5 people you can fit there opinions together and get a better outcome. Kid President once said ""Use your brain"". I bring this up because 5 opinions is stronger than 1. It's using more brain power!

Even if there advice doesnt help, you still know that you can talk to people about what your going through. When people especially your friends know your having problems they'll reach out and ask about how you are and whats going on in your life. 1,000's of people die to suicide every year from not reaching out for help. Knowing that someone is always there is an amazing thing to know. When I have a problem I have 3 friends I always ask and it gets resolved in a short time.

If you ask for advice and it doesnt solve the problem you have to ask more people and tell the first person there advice didnt help. Think about it instead of failing to solve your problem then going back to square one of asking then doing just start the process by asking 5 people and trying all 5 if the others dont work. If you have 5 ways of doing something and they all dont work then it may not be fixable but keep asking 5 those dont work 5 more just keep trying to solve. When the person you originally asked comes to you and says ""So what happened"" you have to tell them there advice didnt help which is a problem in itself for some people. When someone tells you that your advice didnt work you sometimes have that urge to argue with them which wont help the situation at all.

Yeah you may say ""more opinions will make you confused about which advice to pick therefore leaving you with another problem to solve"". But the solution to that is by taking bits of each piece of advice and complete the puzzle. I think you should ask 3-5 people there opinion on a problem. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
8B9D13065168,"Hearing multiple opinions can be very useful to solve situations. That is why when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This is why seeking multiple opinions can help some one make better choice by receiving different view points, they can obtain better advice, and they can get more than one solution for what ever they need help with.

One way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices is receiving different view points. For example, when I was in second grade I was made fun of for not playing basketball at a socially acceptable standard. I was stricken with rage due to the torment I got from the other boys. Their taunting led me to tell my parents. As we talked I expressed to them that I wanted to hurt them, I wanted to treat them the way they were treating me. I wanted them to feel the growing anger inside of me. However, my parents quickly stopped me and told me that violence is never the answer. They acknowledged the way I felt but told me if I truly wanted to get back at the kids I had to practice. I asked them how practicing basketball would free me of my anger. They responded saying that If I practiced and became good at basketball the kids would have no reason to bother me about it anymore. I did what my parents said and practiced like my life depended on it. I soon was able to play almost better than everyone who teased me. If my parents had not shared another view point, then I would have lashed out on the kids who made me fell awful. My parents different opinion caused me to make a better decision. Another example of this is when I witnessed another kid getting bullied. In fifth grade a boy in my class was getting bullied by two other boys. I saw them picking on the other boy almost everyday. I didnt want interfere because I was afraid of getting bullied too. I tried to ignore the actions of the boys and just stay away from them. My plan to ignore them worked for a while, however, the burden was becoming to overwhelming. I told my sister about the situation to get it off of my chest. She then told me that I was right to not interfere but I should have got a teacher involved. The next day I went to a teacher and told her about the bullying and from that day on the two boys stopped bullying the other boy. In both of these examples I sought after different opinions and I received different view points on the situations, which led me to make better choices. This is why one way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices is by receiving different view points.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices is because they can get better advice. For example, I tried to get my dad's opinion on an outfit I had prepared for a party I was going to. he said my outfit looked fine and that I should go to the party in it. For a second opinion I went to my mom to see what she thought.

she told me that it look awful. We then went into my closet and prepared a completely different outfit. At the party I got many compliments on my outfit and it was all thanks to my mom. Another example of this is when I needed advice on what I should get for my friend's birthday. My friend Generic_Name's birthday party was around the corner and I still had not purchased a present for her. I asked some of my other friends what they thought I should get for her. They all said things like candy, jewelry, and clothes. Before I went to get anything I asked one last person, which was Generic_Name's best friend Generic_Name, what she would like. I told Generic_Name about the suggestions I got from my other friends. She said that she was glad I had not gotten any of those things because Generic_Name was not really into them. She said what Generic_Name did like was books. I kept this in mind and bought her an adventure book. when her party arrived she opened my present and burst into joy. In both of these examples I got advice from multiple people and some advice was better than others. Asking more people for their opinions led me to making better choices. This is why another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices is because they can get better advice.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices is by getting multiple solutions. For example I needed help on my math homework. I went to my Mom first and asked her for help. The work was on multiplication and division. My mom took a look at my homework and started to explain a method I could use to conquer multiplication and division faster. I understood the method but I didnt like it very much. I thanked her then went to my dad. I asked him if he knew a way to solve my work also. Luckily he did and showed me how to do it. I liked his way more, although it did take longer to do. I finally completed my homework using my dad's method. Another example of this is when I was in third grade. I was completing my math work and got an answer for a problem. My answer was 5/10ths. I then asked my friend Generic_Name his opinion on my answer and he said that it was wrong. I asked him what he got and he said 1/2. Together we went to the teacher and asked who was write. He said that we were both right, however, in this case we needed to simplify. This meant that Generic_Name was right. In both of these examples I got multiple opinions and multiple solutions and through these answers I learned better options for me.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is important to make better choices. That is why seeking multiple opinions can make help someone make better choices by receiving different view points, they can obtain better advice, and they can get more than one solution for whatever they need help with.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
5C123B44E9B7,"""Would asking multiple people for advice help me to make a better choice?"" That is a question you have probably asked yourself before. The short answer is yes, asking multiple people could assist you in making a better choice. But now you may be wondering why and how it could help. Well, seeking opinions from multiple people rather than one person is more helpful because it gives you more options, it gives you a rough majority of what people think is the right choice, and lastly, it makes people aware of your situation.

Getting more opinions from different people is helpful for making a good choice because it gives you more options by default. For example if you ask multiple people for their opinion, you'd most likely get more than one option to choose from. But say you got one opinion from one person. That leaves you with one option which most often wouldn't help your situation greatly. As you can see from the example, having multiple options is always better than one because there could be more choices to choose from, and it could give you ideas for how you want to handle your situation.

Another way seeking more help is useful is because it gives you a rough majority of what most people think is the right choice. An example would be; if 90% of people say option A, and 10% of people say option B, then option A is more than likely a better choice. As shown by the example, if you identify and know what the majority thinks, then it could lead you into making a good choice because you know what people think is the correct thing to do. In the sense that you are talking to good people that you trust.

Lastly, searching for more assistance from multiple people could support you because it makes more people aware of your current situation. For instance, if you tell more trusted people about what's wrong, some of them would not only give you advice, but they would even offer to help. During rough times, sometimes the best feeling is knowing you're not alone. Making more people aware and gettig more help will support you. This should pathe a way for you to make a good decision.

These are the major three components of why getting assistance from multiple people is better than getting assistance from one person. The reason why gaining help from multiple people is better than one person is because you get more options, you can identify what the majority thinks, and finally, it makes people aware of what's wrong. In conclusion, the next time you find yourself in a sticky situation, remember that asking more people for support rather than one person is more than likely helpful for you.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
21C84DF6129A,"Imagine going up to a friend and asking, ""What should I do?"", then they give you all the wrong answers? This is exactly why seeking multiple opinions is a great way to go. When you are seeking advice, and you look for multiple opinions you can get unbiased opinions, because you have more than one piece of advice. You can also have more advice to choose from, so you really can find the piece of advice that you like the most. The more advice you get, the better your decision is, because you can look at all the opinions and put them together to create an even better solution to the problem.

When seeking advice, sometimes you may get biased opinions. You may find someone who already feels a certain way about something and does not care about what happens to you. When getting advice you may run into things like this. If you get multiple opinions on a subject, you will almost never get all biased opinions. If you just get one opinion and it is biased, then you may put yourself in a bad situation, because you took that piece of advice, not knowing that that advice was biased and would put you in that situation. Making the better choice is what is important. Getting a biased or bad opinion just goes against making the right decision. If you get multiple opinions, and one of them is biased, but you listen to all the other ones, you can tell which one is biased and not make that bad decision. So getting multiple opinions helps you make the right decisions.

If you need good advice but you just want advice that is right for you, seeking multiple opinions is always better. This is because you have more advice to choose from. When getting advice from one person, you may get advice that you like but does not fit with who you are. This is because with only one piece of advice to choose from, because you can't think of your own, you have a small choice that you may not like, but you just do because you did not know what else to do. When getting multiple opinions, you have more advice to choose from so you can always choose the best advice for you and all the other people involved in the situation. With having more decisions to choose from, the decision making can be hard, but with all these choices you can have conversations with people to decide what the true best choice is. If you get multiple decisions, you can get advice that helps you more, therefore making the better decision.

When seeking advice to make a good decision, the more advice you get the better your decision is. With more opinions, you have better solutions. The goal is to try to make the right decision. With only one piece of advice it is awfully difficult to make the right decisions, and even if you do, it would not be as good as a decision made with multiple pieces of advice. This is due to the fact that with a lot of good information you can put it together and take the good parts from a the different pieces of advice and information and combine them into an even better solution to the problem. With one piece of advice, it is impossible to do that. Getting a second opinion is always a very smart decision, especially when you have to make a hard decision, that requires a lot of thinking.

In conclusion, I have shown some reasons out of many that show that getting multiple decisions is always the smart thing to do. Some reasons include that when just getting one opinion it may be a biased or bad piece of advice. Another reason is that when getting more advice you have more pieces of advice to choose from, making the decision better for yourself and the people around you. Finally, having more advice, the better the decision becomes, which is what the goal is, to make the best choice. Getting multiple opinions on a subject is the best way to go, because you will almost always make a better decision than when you did not get multiple pieces of advice.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

Asking multiple people can give you more ideas and it could be a lot smarter asking for advice. Therefore you were writing a main idea and your main idea was just the hunted house and if you go and ask people for a good spooky main ideas they can come up with main ideas you have not even thought about. However if you got a group and ask them to come up with ideas every one will many ideas and you can just figure out which idea is the best.

Manner-better choices

It can sometimes be hard if someone is trying to make a better choice. Like if your being bad and your teacher gave you an advice and the advice was to do all your work and to behave and your grade will increase. Your going to have to make a better choice to behave or not behave. And if you cant pick you can just go and ask other people if you should start behaving more in class. One of the guys says one day your going to become a leader one day and he will have to be a good person.

Tone- expiring

Seeking multiple options can help you in a good way because it can give you more ideas,something you never thought about, something thats new that came to mind, making a better choice, more details that come to mind.

Therefor you were doing a group project. The teacher would want you to form a group because when your doing your project. The other students that are working with you on the class project they can come up with new details about the project. And you project will get completed fast that you will have more ideas you wanted to add for the project. Like if your were doing a project about any animal your group would pick the animal they know mostly about. Then you come up with a idea and you think its not a good idea.

First, I would want them to tell me what they think is correct because i'm not always sure what to do. When and where or how I should do it and what I should do. Im not always sure, I just know I want to do something but i'm not so sure if its the correct thing to do. Most of the time If get in trouble when I dont think about what i'm going to do, I just do and most of the time its not my very best decisions. So I would ask a friend what they thought about how i reacted or expressed my self, most of the time it goes bad but manage to fix what i did and learn from them.

Then,

I would ask my friend if they agree on what I did. If not that then i'd talk to some one who I trust and ask them what they would have done in that situation. Some opinions are not always the best to take because they would rather see you in bad steps instead of you succeeding in life. Not all the people around you are you friends. some people would say you did a good job even though you know what you did wasnt good at all and ended up getting you in so much trouble.

Finally, You have to learn which people would give you good advice and help you get through things. You would have to do whats best for you not whats best for other people because their not going to be their your whole life. Once your out of high school your probably never going to see them again you have to do the correct thing and only you know what that would be.

0496DBA378FB,"Picture a movie. Now, picture a conflict, and then a mad dash to the airport to declare love or patch things up between the protagonist and a prospective soulmate. In the end, the problem is solved, and the two people have found each other despite all odds. The outcome is picturesque, perfection tied up with a bow. However, it wasn't always this way. Something has to happen for the protagonist to finally hop into a taxi and speed off into the sunset. That something almost always takes place after the main character is overwhelmed with something they cannot control, something they find too hard to handle on their own. That something is advice. The value of advice to the protagonist is surely immeasurable, as it shows that someone cares, and provides them with a plethora of separate ways to look at the issue. Advice is vital to a person's grasp of a situation, and the positive effects of good advice are priceless.

We as human beings crave empathy. If it is lacking from a person's life, chances are they will be drawn to any hint of it from somebody else. Advice is a common form of empathy, as it is made up of an understanding of a certain situation and sympathy towards the problems it is causing a person. It displays a level of awareness that isn't found in other contexts. Being able to listen to advice from more than one person helps regardless of what is being said, because it reassures a person that they are not alone in dealing with their problem.

Even though advice is generally recieved from trusted individuals, it is important to be careful. When it comes from someone whose intentions are to help solve the issue, it can have a positive effect on the reciever. If it is doled out by someone whose sole intention is to benefit themselves, it can harm everyone involved. In order to avoid the latter, it is exceedingly important to rely on not just one person's opinion, but a wide variety of solutions to the problem. That way, instead of risking your emotions and livelihood on a single, possibly prejudiced opinion, you can analyze an array of opinions to find the ones that help you the most.

A month ago, I found out I was moving to another county. This meant that I would be away from the high school that I had applied to, and that because of the distance I wouldn't be able to see my friends again. It seemed like there was no successful end in sight, and that I had tried every possible solution with no outcome. I went to see a therapist to talk about this issue, and to seek some reassurance that I would be all right no matter where I went. Listening to one person, however, didn't help me feel any better. In the end, what helped was talking it through with my friends and listening to each and every one of their opinions on the matter. I didn't feel alone, as though I was the only one who cared about how this was affecting me, and I was able to look at the situation with fresh eyes. I was faced with solutions I hadn't even considered, because they were coming from people who could empathize with me in a different way. When it came to how to handle this difficult experience, I could make a choice based on not just my own thoughts, but the thoughts of those around me. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Making an important decision by yourself can be very hard when you are indecisive or you can't figure out what is the best choice to make. When someone is in need of help, they tend to ask several other people for advice. Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice can help someone make a better choice as it provides different perspectives on the problem and can help take weight off of their shoulders.

Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice can help someone make a better choice as it provides different perspectives on the problem. Sometimes, when people are struggling to make a good decision, one of the reasons why is due to the fact that they are only looking at the situation from their own point of view. You may subconsciously think about the point of view of someone else, but in difficult, unfamiliar situations, it can be hard not to look at life as if you are the main character. Advice from other people can make you try to put yourself in someone else's shoes, causing you to realize things that you didn't before. Asking several others for advice can help someone make a better choice by causing them to realize that other people matter and that even the side characters in their story are the main characters of other stories.

Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice can help someone make a better choice as it can help take weight off of their shoulders. People can forget to relax when they are overwhelmed, have a lot going on in their lives, or are having trouble deciding what is the best choice to make. It is easier to make a decision when your mind is clear and you have only a few things to worry about. People's opinions are based on their past experiences, and asking for help from someone who can empathize or sympathize with you can lead to you making a better choice than what you would have if you didn't. Asking for advice from several different people can help someone make a better choice as it takes some weight off of their shoulders; it can make it easier to make decisions and also make you realize that you are not the only one facing this problem.

Sometimes, relying on the opinions of others is a better choice that just follow your heart's desire.

Why Asking More Than One Person is a Good Idea.

Sometimes people ask mutable people for advice. Why people ask mutable people for advice is that more than one person is less likely to be wrong. The three main reasons that a group is less likely to be wrong are different people know different things, they often have different life experints, biases are less likely a group than one person. Asking more people is better than asking one person.

With people knowing different things. That is from that the fact that no one person has the sum toddle of human knallige. Just because two people know the same thing they may have different waste of doing it. In short asking more people will end you up with more infrmashin.

Some people may work in a job outside or inside for exeapul so asking mutable people can have different exeperints. From that asking people with different wases of doing thing so you can find the best way. Anther thing to consider is people have different acutes. With people having different life exepernts it is best to ask more than one person.

In being human comes biases so to avode them you must ask more than one person. Why biases are bad are that they waste your's and others' time. Biases also are more afotin than not wrong. Last they are baste on feelings and not facts. All of those reasons are why biases are one big part of why you should ask more than one person when looking for advice.

In short you should ask more than one person for advice. Why that is the prevesly stated reasons different people know different things, people have different life exepints, and to avode biases. All that is why asking more than one person is better that asking one.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

When someone is unsure of something or needs opinions on something they turn to asking multiple people for help. Asking others can help give you honest answers and can help give you more ideas. When seeking advice people tend to ask multiple people, to help talk things out, to see if anyone has had experience or to find the best advice.

Talking things out with multiple people can help you calm down about certain issues. Feeling more relaxed and calm can help you resolve a problem or help you realize that whatever happened wont last forever and feeling calm can and will just help with your self a stem and anxiety. when talking things out with people you can get all your frustration, anger and sadness out. Telling multiple people what happened and what went wrong can help you realize what really went down and if your at fault, if others are or if you both are to blame.

Finding someone with experience on something can be a huge help.

When you know someone who has dealt with the same issue before, hearing what they did to resolve this issue can help you tremendously to decide what you should do. Also when you see your not the only one going through something that can help you feel better about your situation and can help you to talk things out with someone whos been there. Talking something out with someone who understands can help you realize if your issue is very big and important or if it will just blow over in time, lastly knowing how someone else got through a problem might make you see what you should or shouldnt do.

When making the best decision about something it always helps to have multiple opinions. Having multiple opinions is like having multiple solutions to choose from. If you only ask one person for help on something you might not know if that was the best opinion or the best advice. So talking/asking multiple people to read over something or to help you or for there opinion will help you to make the best choice over all.

Talking to multiple people for advice is likely to help someone make the best choice. It gives them more feed back,and will help them understand what to do. Not just one person will always know how to handle certain situations thats why its a good idea to ask others. People normally ask multiple people for advice to help them, to see if anyone has experience with there problem, to talk things through with others and to get the best advice.                  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

8A6AAA29FBB2,"Have you ever been in a sticky situation, and needed some strong advice? I assume you went and talked to more than one trusted person. If you didn't I'll tell you why you should have. When seeking for advice you should talk to more than one person because, there will be a variety of opinions, you can learn from many individuals' mistakes, and the people giving advice can share many experiences, not just one.

When many people are asked to give advice, there will be a variety of opinions. That means everyone will have a different point of view on the issue or situation. The multiple opinions makes it better for you to receive advice. One individual's standpoint is bias, because they only believe in one thing. On the other hand, many individuals' standpoint isn't bias, the reason being : everyone thinks different.

People are human, they make mistakes and errors, but we wouldn't be able to learn and grow without them. Just learning from your own mistakes is helpful, but imagine learning from multiple people and their mistakes. You might not even realize how learning from the mistakes of people is such a habit. For example if you're walking on the street and see someone trip on a pothole, you obviously are going to know not to trip on the pothole. Another example for instance is if you know someone that made friends with an unkind person, most likely you would stay away from that person. Just think about how you could avoid making a ton of mistakes by listening to others and their accidents.

If you seek advice from a person, they are probably wiser and more experienced. It's common sense why you get advice from someone older, wiser, more experienced, or smarter than you. A five year old most likely couldn't give outstanding advice to a twenty year old. One wise statement of advice could get someone far, but multiple wise statements from many people is much better.

The final verdict is that it is much better to seek advice from many people, compared to only one or just yourself. You will have a variety of options and opinions, you can learn from many individuals' mistakes, and you can get advice from people with different experiences. So next time you're stuck in a sticky situation and you don't know what to do, think about getting advice from multiple people.                  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
8F85E4509835,"Have you ever asked someone for advice? I always ask people for advise it makes things a lot easier. When asking for advice seeking more than one opinion can help you make a better choice. Reasons why are you would want to ask someone who has been through it before, one person might not be good at giving advise as someone else would, and one person might not have your best interest in mind like some others. Let me elaborate.

When asking someone for advice it usually helps if they have been through it before and chances are the more people you ask the more likely your going to ask someone who has been through it. For example if you ask one friend they might have not experienced what your talking about, but if you ask another one your chances are higher because you asked more people. I always ask at least two people before making a big decision. If you asked for advise on how to swim you would want to hear from a swimmer not someone who cant swim so it would be smarter to ask multiple people. I once asked the wrong person how to ride a bike and I still feel the pain to this day. Just sit there and think for a second, The more people you ask the more likely youve asked someone that has gone through it before. This is like in the movies when a girl is in a breakup and is asking her friend what should she do. This is my first reason why I think asking multiple people for advice is better that one.

Having more opinions is better than having one because one person just might not be good at giving advise. What happened when you ask a friend for advise and the dont know so they give you almost like a guess? Chances are its not gonna be good. This has happened to me before and resulted in me losing lots of money. If you ask one person then another person ones advise might be better than the other one. So what if you didnt ask both? One time a friend told me to jump off the roof, but my other friend said us the ladder and I used the ladder and made it down safe. You could also ask three people and one isnt good at giving advise one is okay and the other is good dont you wanna ask all three so you can get good advise? This is usually like my friends vs. my parents. This is my second reason why I think you should ask multiple people.

Having more opinions is also a good idea because not everyone has your best interest in mind or knows whats best for you. What if you ask one friend for advice and their mad at the moment and they probably dont have your best interest in mind and you should get another opinion. I try not to ask mad friends for advise when possible.

You should ask multiple people because everyone dosent know whats best for you. My parents are the only people who know whats best for me.

Also your friends and peers dont always have your best interest in mind, sometimes they could give you bad advice to be funny. This happens to me all the time. This is my third reason why seeking more than one opinion can help you make a better choice.

When asking for advice seeking more than one opinion can help you make a better choice. Reasons why are you would want to ask someone who has been through it before, one person might not be good at giving advise as someone else would, and one person might not have your best interest in mind like some others.

Seeking multiple opinions can be much more helpful then one because others might have different perspectives, advice they can give, and you'll have less doubts on making a decision.

Different perspectives from different people can always be better than only hearing one out and it can help you make a decision. Many people need help on figuring out a decision and can't just count on one person for help they need to hear it from another perspective. I always find it best to ask many people for opinions so I can see it through them and what they think. Getting help to make a right choice might just need you to find the right person that truly cares to help you. When I'm looking for someone to help me I always know to find friends and family members I can trust. I think if you can't figure out the problem out on your own then maybe friends can help you in a way to make it better. I sometimes talk to friends and we always help each other out by talking it through putting it in a way so we all can understand each other. There are different ways to find different perspectives that can help a someone see it in a different way to understand.

When people give you advice it can help to fix the situation. Sometimes you can't figure out what to do in a situation but if your asking someone for help they could give you some advice that can help you through it. When I'm at school and need some advice on how to get better in math my teacher or friend can give me options that will help me get better. Also, for people going through a hard time they can get some advice from friends to speak to a counselor or just ask help from their parents. If I every see someone going through a hard time I like to help by giving advice and letting them know that maybe they could talk to a counselor or a trusted adult. Sometimes you may be stuck in a situation where you want to play a sport but are afraid but, finding different people too help you by giving there experience playing a sport can help you not to be afraid. When I played a sport at first I didn't know what it was gonna be like but people that already played the sport soccer gave me advice so it has helped me to now love soccer. Sometimes you don't know ways to fix your situation but finding help from others to give you advice and it will help you a lot.

Seeking multiple opinions can give you less doubts on a decision your making. This is because finding the help of others makes you have less doubt in a situation where you have to make a decision. I have been in a place where I had doubts on if could do well on a hard test but having others give you help believe in yourself makes it way better. When there's someone that gives you the time and helps you find ways to make things better and gives you courage and hope it can also make you have less doubts. Whenever my mom tells me I can do it and when others believe in me I feel so much more confident and doubtless. We might not be able to do something when we are confused but when we have support from others not just one person but more than one that can help you lose all your doubts. I feel that one person may not just be able to help me but asking for others to help me to is so much greater than one. Feeling doubtful can be hard but there will always be many people that can help you through the hard times.

Seeking multiple opinions can make someone make a good choice because of having different perspectives from others, getting advice from others, and having less doubts on making a decision. By having perspectives from other people you can see things in a different way and having advice can help you find ways to fix what's going on and this helps you to have less doubts to make decisions. I believe finding multiple opinions are much better than just one from one person because just hearing one person won't help you as much as asking many people so you have different thoughts and ways to make a good decision.                   ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

F92B3B747F33,"""Hmm,"" said Generic_Name as he thought about what sport he should choose to play after school. ""I am completely lost,"" Generic_Name thought to himself. Generic_Name couldn't make up his mind at all, ""Perhaps I should ask someone what sport they think I should play,"" said Generic_Name. Some time later Generic_Name met up with his friend Generic_Name. ""What sport do you think I should play?"" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. ""Well I enjoy playing soccer, so I think you should play soccer too"" Generic_Name replied. Generic_Name didn't even think about soccer until Generic_Name mentioned it. He thought soccer was a great idea but he also thought he should get more opinions from other people. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make the better choice because they will have more options to choose from, they can make the best choice possible, and they might get ideas that they didn't even of yet.

First, they will have more options to choose from. The more options you have to choose from, the better it is for you. To clarify, someone who gets one opinion doesn't have as many options as someone who gets five opinions. The person who asked five different people for their opinion would have a better chance in making the best choice because he has more options to choose from than the person who only got one opinion. Having more choices to choose from can make you think harder about your final decision. To elaborate, the more choices you have, the more you have to think in order to make you decision. Because you have more options, it will take you longer to come up with you decision. In summery, one way to make the better choice is to have many options to choose from.

Next, they can make the best choice possible. To begin with, you get the chance to decide which option is the best for you. For example, if you had the option to join both the basketball team and the football team, you would join which ever team you like the most. If you like to play football, you would join the football team. If you prefer play basketball, then you would join the basketball team. It's best to have at least three or more different opinions from people that you know because the opinion that they give you could be based off of things that they know that you like to do, see, or even play. For instance, if you ask someone such as you parents, your teachers, or even you friends, which sport you should play, depending on how long you've known them, they can tell you an honest answer that can help you out in making the best choice. To summarize, it is very important to have multiple opinions because they can help you make the best choice possible.

Lastly, they might get ideas that they didn't even think of yet. To start off with, the person you ask could help you make you decision by giving you an idea that you didn't think of. For example, when Generic_Name asked his friend Generic_Name what sport he should play. Generic_Name told him that he should play soccer. Playing soccer didn't cross Generic_Name's mind so when Generic_Name recommended it to him Generic_Name got a new option that he didn't think of before. The more you ask people for their opinion, the more likely you are to get brand new ideas that you didn't think of before. In fact, the more people Generic_Name were to ask, the more brand new ideas he would get. Therefore, getting multiple opinions can increase your chances of getting new ideas that you haven't thought of yet.

""So what do you think I should do?"" Generic_Name asked his dad. ""Well when I was about your age I played football and knowing how you play it all the time with your friends, I think you should do football."" Generic_Name's Dad replied. Generic_Name took it into consideration and really like the thought about playing football after school. Just to be safe Generic_Name asked one more person for their opinion on what he should play. Generic_Name thought it would only be right to ask his favorite gym teacher Mr. Generic_Name since they always do all kinds of activities in his class. ""Mr. Generic_Name what sport do you think I should choose to play?"" Generic_Name asked politely. ""When we played baseball in class you really seemed to enjoy it,"" Mr. Generic_Name said. ""Your right I really did enjoy playing baseball in class, tGeneric_Name Mr. Generic_Name!"" said Generic_Name as he waved goodbye to Mr. Generic_Name. Now that Generic_Name had three different options to choose from he was ready to make his decision. Generic_Name though about it for a while until he knew what he was going to choose. ""I'll play football!"" Generic_Name said. In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make the better choice because they will have more options to choose from, they can make the best choice possible, and they might get ideas that they didn't even of yet.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
810142FCE213,"Did you know that many people usually ask multiple people for advice? When asing someone for advice, getting more opinions are better. Advice and knowledge are both bigger in numbers, for example, you could ask someone what they know and they might not have good information, When you ask multiple people for advice, you have more opinions and outlooks, when you ask one person about how to draw a picture, one person may have advice that only works well for them. When you ask multiple people for advice, you get more opinions that you can choose or branch your ideas off of.

Usually, when there are more opinions that you could choose from, you have more time to think about the consequences there will be with each choice. When it comes to advice, different options will benefit you more, or they will benefit you less. If there is a variety of options, you have more benefits and outcomes to work with. If you were to ask for advice, ask as many people as possible, because the advice that you get from everyone will be helpful in some way.

When you ask someone about how to do your job, they may not know how to, but when you ask someone that has worked in your job for a long time, they would know, so their advice wouldn't be faulty. Even if you were to ask one person, there could still be faulty information, so you could get other information from different people that have done your job as well. The more people you have in a group, the better, one person may good at one thing, but someone else may be good in another.

There is always a possibility that someone may have better advice or information than another. You should always ask many people for advice, because information is better altogether. You should always gather lots of advice in case some of it is faulty. When you have advice that is pointless, you cant do anything that will benefit you. You should always gather advice from people that look capable of doing something first.

Its always best to have as much advice as possible, because advice is information that may not be in a book. It would be best if you had as much advice as possible. Advice from many people is important. You should try using as much advice as possible to benefit yourself in as many ways as possible.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
D0131DAC0F63,"You always ask your parents, teachers, or other family members for advice. Advice means a wise opinion from someone. Asking for advice is very important to learn for when you get older. Asking for help can help you make the right decision, it helps you find out who your friends are, and it will make you dependable for other people to ask you for advice.

First, it will help you make the right decision. Making the right decison is very important when you are dealing with school, jobs, or even cleaning. Asking for advice in school is very important. You can ask your teachers for advice when you are struggling with a subject. Even when you ask your friend for some advice to ask out a girl or boy. When you ask advice in your job is helpful too. When you ask your co-worker if you should ask your boss for a raise, or when you ask your boss if you can move up a position in your career area. When you are cleaning, that is totally different. Asking advice from your parents/guardian about what should you clean next. Two reasons to do that. One, it keeps you out of trouble. Two, it helps your parents/guardian by making them do less work around the house. Expecially if they have a job outside of the house.

Next, it helps you find out who your friends are. If they are your friend they would give you the best advice possible. That has happend to me before, a friend giving me advice that got me in a whole lot of trouble. He wasn't my true friend. Don't have a friend like that, you need to have a reliable, nice, relaxed, truthful, and expecially likes the same things you do. Its helps grow a bond like no other. Asking advice from your friends can be a good thing and a bad thing. Always be careful of a friends advice.

Last but not least, it helps make you dependable for other people to ask you for advice. You may need some advice sometimes, but you can still give people some advice. Giving advice will make them belive you are a really good friend. It is always nice to give back advice but always try to make it positive. If you don't, You can loose a lot of friends. A positive word of wisdom, ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""

In conclusion, Advice is not always a bad thing. You just need to be careful where you get it from. Its is good to get advice because it can make you dependable for advice, it can help you find out who your friends are, and helps you make the right decision. I am going to give you some advice,""don't worry about the small things,live life to the fullest.""",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C0E1F745436E,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes ask more than one person. The reason being that some people look for more opinions on the matter and to see if the advice are connected to each other. The more other people give the same exact advice as the other means that you should most certainly follow the common advice that is giving to that person. People don't want to follow the same opinion's from the same person because people will need to let other people see what they think on it so it would be so biased. It is always good to talk to a councilor because they have many years of experience and its their job to give advice. Seeking multiple opinions is always the best choice. The advice that they give you will sometimes be worth something in the future. Sometimes people can use advice even when they don't need it, getting advice will make you better at understanding and other normal life things such as testing, work or job and subjects at school or university.

With many years of advice at your hand you will be wise and intelligent, you will know what people are going through. Also, with advice from other people you can master at certain skills and achieve your dreams. There are many forms of advice you could use or really need. Try to get as many advice from wise people with experience like older people who have been what you're going through; it's a good idea to follow what they say because it can help you. But beware, some people can give false advice that will make the situation worse or not give you advice at all take caution of these people because it can impact your life and future or relationship, it could be they don't care or that they just dont like talking about it.

Talk with the people you can trust, not random strangers because false advice will be destroy you even more. If you are a teenager you should go to your parents and speak to them directly because they have more experience than you they have been trough more than you asking your friends will make thing worse than they already are; ask your parents and if they dont have an answer you can ask a councilor at a school they will be very happy to help you with your situation.

If your having a serious personal problem, the best idea would be to consult with a therapist they are experts and are very smart. They will help you with life problems and the best part is that you can trust them with anything that why they are there for. The perfect way of dealing with loss is to get advice from different people they have to be people you trust and known for years. Have a good mental mindset to get ready to accept advice from different people. It also very important to get advice from other people because you can benefit from it, getting the right help you need can always prevent actions from happening. If you need help to deal with drugs and alcohol go to a local rehab center there will be professionals to help you deal with advice and what to do to lose the addiction. Getting help is always the right idea. in cunclusion, getting help or advice can always help you with the things you are going to deal with right now or in the future just remember to get help from people you trust and not strangers.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

They're around us all the time.

Some are big and some are small, but all of them are important.

Most of us can handle making decisions for ourselves.

However, sometimes its not easy.

We might need some insight.

More opinions may just help us out a little.

Knowing multiple viewpoints is they key to making the best decision.

Think back to a time when you were indecisive.

Most likely, you were scatterbrained.

Your mind might have been all over the place trying to decide what is right.

In a situation like this, seeking other opinions is very beneficial to you.

Not only do you feel more calm knowing you have options, but you could also learn about a good solution you may not have thought of.

For example, one time I was having trouble deciding what to do for an art project.

I asked my art teacher what I should do, and I didn't really like her response.

When I went home I asked my grandma what I should do for my project, and she had some great ideas.

Asking multiple people, lead me to finding a great idea that I would have never thought of myself.

At some point in your life, you have probably questioned whether or not you made the right decision.

Instead of dwelling over it, you can ask people if they agree.

Chances are, if multiple people have the same answer its a good one.

Its very similar to math class.

If multiple people have the same solution to a math problem, than that solution is probably correct.

Whether you are really struggling, a little indecisive, or just curious, seeking multiple opinions is going to help you know what to do.

You could learn about new ideas, or be reassured that you're right.

Other peoples thoughts could have the ability to take you a long way.

Just remember that no matter what, someone always has an answer for you.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
B89FAB59B1B3,"Have you ever asked multiple people for advice because I know I have. Some reasons why you should ask multiple people for advice is you get different types of advice to choose from. You also get to choose the best advice for you,and if you ask multiple people for advice you have a better chance of choosing the right advice.

I think you should ask multiple people for advice because you get different types of advice. If you have different types of advice then you have more advice to choose from. If you only ask one person for advice there advice could be completely wrong. But if you have more advice to choose from you get the best advice for you. so if you only get advice from one person and you dont like the advice that they gave you then go and ask more people for advice.

If you ask multiple people for advice you have so many more chances to get the right advice for you. But if you dont ask multiple people for advice then I think you should consider doing it. Because I asked for advice on how to beat a level to a video game and I asked my little brother for advice and his advice did not work. Then I asked all of my friends for advice and none of there advice worked. But then I asked my older brother and his advice worked and I was so happy and i realized that I had to ask so many people for advice to beat this level and only one of there advice worked. So if you ask multiple people for advice try the advice and if it does not work dont give up and keep trying just ask more people for advice.

Overall I would definitely ask multiple people for advice because it gives you more advice to choose from,you can choose the best advice for you,and if you ask multiple people for advice then you have a better chance of finding the right advice.            ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
0814426B27DF,"Most people ask more than one person for advice there are many reasons for this but I'm going to say three reasons why I think people asking more than one person for advice is good.

One reason I think must people do this is to see which idea was the most responses. Another reason is you could test every idea that you get.

One last reason is some of the people could agree with the other person.

People try to ask a good amount of people just in case they hear more than one response from someone.

This is good to hear a lot of ideas and to see how many you get from the people you ask.

Don't ever be afraid to ask for advice from more than one person.

Maybe you have had to do this maybe you have had someone else ask you for advice.

Well i sure did I've had lots of times where I have asked someone in my family for advice.

Sometimes you are able to test some of the ideas you get.

This depends on what type of advice you are trying to take from someone.

Maybe you might be building something small like a shed and you have never built something before but you are determined to build it.

So you go and ask a friend that you know to tell you a few things on doing this job but before you go and build you go and practice on something so you know what to do.

I can relate to this you may even be able to relate.

I'm trying to build a tree house and I have had to ask for advice on building the treehouse.

The last reason is that one of the people you asked for advice may say or think the same thing as someone else that you asked for advice for.

Some don't think all the same things if you were to ask a bunch of people for advice they will not all give you the same answers but they will sometimes have the same meanings to them.

I think everyones ideas and try to show respect and listen but I don't take too much advice just in case that advice doesn't sound quite right like I said before don't be afraid to ask someone for advice.

Some people will disagree with my three reasons but I don't like to listen to the people who disagree with my reasons.

Maybe this helped you maybe it didn't.

To see which ideas was the most responsive ideas, you could test every idea you asked for and some might agree with one of the other ones you took advice from those are my three reasons on why most people take advice from more than one person.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
6B5809C83978,"Has anyone ever gave you advice? Was the advice helpful to the situation? Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Getting different opinions can help someone make a better decision because they will get multiple answers, different types of advice, and they will have more information on the situation then they started with.

By seeking multiple opinions people will get different answers and possibly make a better choice. For example, I was having trouble deciding what I should do my science project on, so I went and asked a few of my teachers. After I asked my teachers I was able to decide because of the advice they gave me. Ultimately, obtaining different problems on a problem can help someone make the best choice.

Not everyone has the same outlook on everything, therefore, asking multiple people for their opinions will give people different types of advice. For instance, I was going to wear an outfit, but I could not decide if it looked good or not so I asked my mom, dad, and brother what they thought. After receiving their opinions I decided to not wear the outfit because everyone but my dad did not like the outfit. All in all, the more people you ask for advice the more diverse answers you will get.

By gathering different advice people will have more knowledge and information on the situation, which will lead to having a higher chance of making the right choice. For example, My family could not decide where to go for vacation, so I went and asked my uncle, who used to traveled the world for photography, for his opinion. After talking for a long time he gave me a great deal of information on where and where to not go for vacation. Finally, after seeking multiple opinions, people will have enough advice and information to make the right choice.

By gathering different opinions it will help people make a better decision. Asking for advice can give people multiple answers, different types of advice, and more information on the subject. So next time you have a problem, and no solution, seek others advice and you will most likely make the better choice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
4C471936CD75,"In ancient times, and also still today in some places, leaders of countries, such as presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, and even the pharaohs of achient Egypt have all had advisers that they would consult to be sure they were making the best decision for their people. But these leaders would almost never have only one adviser, but more often than not they would have several in order to make sure they were doing what was right. But why would some of these leaders insist that they speak to multiple trusted advisers before they made any important decisions? I think some of the reasons people, not solely world leaders, sometimes ask for advice from multiple trustworthy people before making a hard decision is because seeking multiple opinions can help you feel better about your decision to know that other people agree with you, and also because getting multiple opinions will increase the probability of one of those opinions being right.

I believe the main reason that people sometimes ask for multiple peices of advice before making hard decisions is because often makes you feel more confident in your choice to know more than one person believes what you are doing is right. For instance, if the President thinks that this is the best time for their country to go to war, but they don't know if any of the people they rule over, or even the rest of the government, thinks the same way, it would almost certainly make the president feel less confident in their decision than if they knew what people thought about their decision, and they might not do as good a job running the country because they might stress about it. But if they consulted many advisers before making that vital decision, the advisers might agree with the president, resulting in the president feeling more confident with their decision and ultimately leading the country better than if they just went with what one person said and didn't ask multiple people for advice first.

Another reason people might go to more than one person for advice before making a decision is because having more opinions increases the probability that one or more of the people you go to for advice might have the right idea as to what you should do. For example, if I'm not sure what college I want to attend, and I ask one friend where I should go, they might say ""George Mason"" as a suggestion. But if George Mason is not in fact the best college for me, even though the person I asked was trying to help, that one opinion could sway me to go there anyway and not have the best experience. But yet if I go to ten people to advice, including the person who suggested George Mason, they might be the only one who would say that and maybe five of the other people I asked might say Virginia Tech, and I would decide to go to Virginia Tech instead of to George Mason, and I would overall be happier and maybe even get better grades. Then I would be more successful because I went to multiple people before I made a decision that could affect my entire life. So therefore even though one person still has a chance to give valid advice, it is safer to talk to multiple people because it increases the chances of making a bad decision.

In my experience, seeking multiple opinions before making a hard decision can be beneficial because of the reasons stated above. When I was in second grade, I passed the test to be admitted into the AAP (Advanced Academics Program) in my school. My best friend was also accepted, and wanted me to go to AAP with her, but I didnt really want to go into AAP. I told my parents this, and they agreed it would be best for me to stay in the normal class for on more year. Since I got my parents' opinions, I also felt more secure staying out of the advanced program even though my friend wanted me to do the opposite and go into the program. And so in third grade, I was not in AAP with my best friend, but nonetheless, I was happy and met many new friends in the normal class, some of whom are still my friends today. When I went into fourth grade, however, I decided that I wanted to go into the AAP program. Since I had already gotten in a year before, I was not required to retake the test and went in smoothly to the advanced program. In this example, I sought three opinions (my parents and my best friend) in order to make a decision, but if I had taken my friend's advice alone, I would have gone into AAP in third grade and not have been as happy as I was in the regular class. This shows clearly that it is better to seek multiple opinions instead of just one. The impact of asking people to help you make a decision can be big, like a country deciding to go to war, or small, like a third grader choosing if they want to go into the advanced program in school, but nonetheless, asking for other people's opinions instead of just one person's opinion can make a difference in someone's life, whether big or small.

Of course, there are many other reasons one might want to seek multiple opinions and pieces of advice instead of just one, but these are the two main ones that I think really make it worthwhile to ask for advice from multiple people instead of making decisions with only one piece of advice from one person. The key thing that all of these examples have shown is that it is better to seek multiple opinions from multiple different people than to only get advice from one. This is ultimately because asking multiple people for advice makes you feel better about the decisions you make and also increases the chances that one or more of the people you consulted with gave you the right advice at the right time to empower you do what is right for you (or perhaps what is right for the country you happen to be in charge of!).                                                                                                                                   ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
D46BCB48440A,"When people ask for advice,they sometimes talk to more than one person. Advice is an opinion,that's told to another person. I think advises help people make better choices. Some reasons I think why advises helps is keeps you safe, makes goal come true, and makes changes.

The reason I think advises help is keeps you safe. There are many dangerous people and thing in the world. That could hurt you in so many ways. When I got invited to a sixteen and up birthday party. I was so ready to go but i didnt know if i should go to the party. So i asked my mom for advice. Then she told me it wouldn't be the best idea,I could get kidnapped. I agreed with her and didn't go. That advice from my mom saved me from getting kidnapped.

Another reason I think Advises help is make goals come true. Getting to your goal is pretty hard. But if you have someone to push you through it you can do it. When I gave up on becoming an Artist. My friend told me some advice telling I need to keep going until i reached my goal. And said she cheering for me. I felt hopeful again and happy that she there for me.

The last reason I think advises help is makes changes. Words are powerful and so are action. They can make things happen with multiple of them. At our school,the lunches are very unhealthy. We tell our teacher but they didn't listen. So we interview people around the school and asked them to sign a paper. Once we were done. We when over to the school board. And told them about the unhealthy lunches at schools. They agreed that schools should change their lunches to healthier lunches. And changed the lunches served a schools.

Advises can be helpful or not helpful. But if it can help you then please listen to it. Don't block it out .So many people think it's useless. But it help in so many like keep you safe,make goals come true or makes changes. You can't do everything on your.

Likewise, being diverse and asking many people for their opinions allows one to understand how most people percieve something. This is especially important as knowing multiple opinions can allow someone to take those views into account and sway themseleves to the general audience. Knowing different people's opinion can be beneficial in a variety of situations.

First and foremost, a great example about how knowing other's opinions is helpful is when someone is making the choice between smoking or refraining from smoking. A student can watch on a TV channel that smoking is bad, and can damage their internal organs. However, on another channel, the student can find advertisements about the most addicting smoking device that can release the most dopomine in the brain, all the while not severly harming people's lungs. This student will receive a variety of different views and opinions on a certain topic, which allows them to make the best educated choice or decision based on how they interpret what they saw. Similarily, a student can be told from his fellow classmates that smoking is fun, joyful, and makes them happy. However, if the student asks a local doctor, they will be informed differently. A doctor will most likely tell them that smoking, although seeming harmless at first, can lead to serious long term consequences.

If the student asks both his friends and his doctors, he is able to use his judgemental skills to determing which choice will be best for him in the long run.

Furthermore, asking for multiple opinions can benifit during competitions for a position slot, as cadidates needs to make decisions on what they need to say or do. For example, it can be helpful in situations like elections, both for the U.S. or simply in school. If a student is running for a position in office to represent his/her school, he/she can ask a widespread and diverse audience. First, asking other students is their best bet to obtaining information. Other students can inform him/her about what they want, like better water fountains, recess, or healthier food. Then, the student running can make changes to the way they run for the election, and on his/her speech, take a different approach. In addition, if the student running asks an adult, they will get to know a more realistic way the school can be improved. Since a student, even as a student officer, isn't able to make a significant change to a school, they can inform the school board about ways to make the school better. If someone is running for the president of the United States, a similar approach can be taken. First, they can ask the people, on social media or in speeches, about positive ways to reform our country. After the candidate receives the opinion of general audiences, they can campaign differently to match the view of those voting. All in all, asking for the opinion of multiple different people can set the candidate apart from others.

Many people only ask one type of audience for their opinion. Having only one opinion can lead to negative consequences, such as making the wrong choices related to health or education, as only one audience is adressed into making a decision. Therefore, asking multiple different people who have different backgrounds is essential to making the best choices in life. Conclusively, knowing multiple opinions on a certain matter can evidently lead to better results for individuals. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
DF920E0A7337,"Have you ever asked more than one person for help on what product to buy in a situation? Interviews are a perfect example of seeking more than one opinion. Interviews are seen on the news, in professional sports, and other places as well. There are a lot of people that can help you buy the right product as well. They can all open you up to new ideas. I think talking to more than one person on an opinion is a better choice because it shows you more than one option, it can change your perspective of a topic, and it informs you about what other people enjoy.

First, I think it shows you more than one option. One opinion of a person might destroy your choice on an option rather than opening it up. The whole point of asking what is the better choice, is to make it better, not worse. You could already have the better opinion, and that person might ruin it, but more people would give you a good balance of what you need to know. Multiple opinions can stride you toward different answers. Different answers will most of the time make things go in the right direction. Its good to show variety in what you're going to pick in order to get the best choice. One opinion could be someone who isn't informed on the idea. They might not know anything about the topic and might just state a random answer. That can really throw you off if you don't get more ideas than just that one person. That can have the same effect as what I said before. That one person could mess it all up for you. All of the people you ask shows you more than what you thought was the best choice.

Next, it can change your perspective on the topic. One person can change your option, but it may not lead you in the right direction. That direction could make you unhappy with your choice if you are comparing a product to see which one to get. You could take that one persons advice and follow it, but it might not be the best advice you could get. Multiple people have a better chance of leading you to the right opinion. When you get the opinion of multiple people, it balances out what might be the favorite option, or what might be the better option. A lot of times, changing your opinion is for the better. You could be looking at the wrong choice, and multiple opinions might lead you to the right path. It gives new ideas and ways to look at a situation and make the right choice. It can make you change your opinion.

Finally, it informs you about what other people enjoy. Having more than one person's opinion might lead to an agreement with those people. You could be really stuck on a certain product you are trying to buy, and someone could save that entire situation by finding a good version of that product. You could also learn more about culture and peoples opinions in a certain area, or a certain time. Many people are different and sometimes that is based off of the environment around them, and where they grow up that could affect what a person likes. If you ask multiple people in the same area you grew up in, you should be leading yourself to the right choice. It can also lead to meeting new people, and making new friends. You could agree on an opinion and start a bond there. It all helps you on knowing not only what you like, but what a lot of other people like.

In conclusion, finding more than one persons view is better because it shows more than one opinion, it can change your own opinion, and it can inform you on what other people enjoy. If you are ever interviewing people, or looking for advice from other people to make the right decision, make sure you ask multiple people and not just one person for that advice! I always ask friends, family, or other people for help and advice if I should do something or not. You've probably asked multiple people for advice as well!",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
