BB9B2400BE18,"Do you go to other people for help or for advice when in a situation or problem? Whenever I am in the middle of a problem I always go to my friends, maybe even my mom. My mom makes me look at the problem at a different perspective. However, my friends help me solve the problem. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, for example, better knowledge, stronger reason of choice, and different perspective.

When someone gives you advice they either have been in the same situation or they must just be a little wiser. They have better knowledge and can help you make your choice. If you don't know much then you can make a choice and it may not have been the best. In my opinion, going to someone else for advice knowing they've been where you are right now and they are willing to help you not make a bad decision I would listen to them. Depending on the situation your in, it may or may not be the best choice, but it's something to keep in mind.

People have different opinions. One you can agree with and the other you might not agree with. But the more the people give you their opinions the more of a stronger and more firm choice you'll make. The choices you make have consequences. And if someone had already done that and there were bad outcomes. Then you probably don't want to follow in the same steps.

There are different perspectives in everything. You only look at it in the perspective you want to look at it by. Like how someone wants you to do track but you don't want to because your scared and don't think your good enough. Someone can tell you that you will get better at it by practicing and that they are as well scared but are willing to try it because they like running and so do you. So looking at it in a different point of view can help you make your choice.

These three examples, better knowledge, different perspective, and stronger reason of choice, could help you a lot when making a choice. Sometimes listening to yourself is the best choice. However, you don't want to make your own decision making when you do not have enough knowledge, it can be very stressful. But in most cases seeking advice is the best way to go. Just make sure your comfortable with your choice and nobody forces it onto you because they are ""wiser"".",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
10C813389A74,"People like me like to think what their choices are when people give advice. When I get advice from one person I have to ask another person just to see if they would give the same advice. I like to know that i have choices to pick from but thats it about me. People like me like to hear everyone opinions just to whats different about what we think. Sometimes we dont have that right advice to give ourselves so we hear what other people have to say.

When people take advice from one person they dont know if they telling the best advice that is good for them so what we do is ask someone else just to see if we can get better advice from someone else. When you hear advice from just one person maybe you don't feel like that was the advice you could of got, so we ask different people what there advice would be to see if you have a better choice. We know that everyone is different no one ever has the same advice but some people dont give the best advice and some people give great advice.

A lot of people give different advice we will not think is correct or maybe we think its the best but sometimes we got to keep our choices open. Ex: when are mom give advice it may not be the best so you may ask your dad to see what he will say and he say something way different then what your mom said so now you like you dad advice more the your moms. There is nothing wrong with getting advice from 10 different people. some one may not like that advice that the person give them so what they do is ask some friends or mom an dad just to be able to think. Maybe you might come up with your own advice but dont think its the best so you hear other people opinions. Having choices to run through is always good cause you can can like like that advice someone give you but you know that might not be like best or you might not like it so ask people. When you have choices to go around you can make the best choice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
2962D1BB17A2,"Say you don't know what to make for dinner, or you're having trouble making a difficult decision. You're probably going to ask someone's advice. Now when asking advice, we don't usually ask just one person do we? No! We ask 2 or 3 different people. Friends, family members, and even neighbors.

It's helpful to get a second opinion on some things, because everybody has different experience than others, everybody knows you differently, and different people have different opinions.

Everybody has different experience with different things. For instance, if you are writing an essay, you could ask your parents advice on how to start, and what to write about etc. They wrote a ton of essays back when they were your age but the writing curriculum was different. Then you could ask your English teacher as well. He/She has plenty of experience in the field of writing, and can give you their thoughts on the subject, with an up to date curriculum. After that, you can take both groups advice, and use what you like best to write a better essay than you would've if you had just asked one of them.

You are a different person to all of the people you know. To your friends, you're someone to joke around with. To your teachers you're a student. To your parents, you're a huge pain in the butt. But if everybody knows you differently, then you will get different advice from different people. For example, asking someone what to wear to a party. Some of your friends would say: ""Oh dress comfortably I know you like to wear clothes that are comfortable!"" and other friends would say ""Dude we know you like to be all 80s retro and stuff dude, dress like that!"" and your parents might say ""Dress correctly and appropriately as if you were going to school, or an interview."" They all know you differently and can give you different advice that can help you make a good decision.

We all get in arguments with other people. Why? Because we all have different opinions! We cant all always agree on the same decision every single time! Like if you ask your mom what she thinks you should get for your girlfriend, she'll probably tell you something like a bouquet of flowers or candy. But if you ask your dad, he might tell you to get them something like a necklace or bracelet. You will get different ideas from everyone but sometimes having more options is a good thing.

Thats why seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better decision. Different people have different experience, everybody knows you as a different person, and everybody has a different opinion on matters. So next time you're troubled on what to do in a difficult situation, or you're stuck in a writers block of some sort, remember, ask advice from a few people. It might help you make a better decision.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
B8321F8B104D,"Would you want help from one person are multiple people? I would want more help not less. People ask for advice from multiple people because the people they are asking may of had the problem before and know what to do and they don't know it, and different people give different advice for the same thing.

Choose between a person how had the same experience as you or 10 people that has not which one would you ask for advice. People how have the same problem are most likely going to give you good advice because they know the trouble of the situation and how to get out of it. Not everyone is going though the same problems as you so trust their advice not everyone else. If they know what to do then do it.

Advice is weird someone says some to help you and the someones says the opposite. If no one knows what you are going though then trust the words of the many but only then. it is good to take in all the advice in like a sponge but release the unhelpful one like things you already know are not going to work.

The more advice you have the more changes that are helpful. Many people don't know how to give good advice so ak more so ou can find people who do give good advice.

People who have good advice are out in the world so ask people don't just stand there and wait just ask. It is good to ask lots of people because the more helpful adivice he better. In conslusion it is good to ask multple people for advice you never know who is going to be helpful.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
F1D42413F451,"If you have an issue, speaking to more than one person can help you in many ways. This is because you can get multiple opinions, and a better outcome to your issue or problem. You may not know it, but you also have plenty of people you can go to. Seeking multiple opinions is also good, because you will figure out the good outcomes and the bad outcomes of your situation; or situations similar to yours.

Speaking to more than one person can give you multiple opinions, all of which can be helpful in deciding what to do. One person who had a bad experience might give you what they did, making everything worse. This is especially true when the issue involves people. If you ask one of your friends, and they say yes to something you know is bad subconsciously, you should get another opinion. Once you go to another loved one, their added advice can lead to a better close to your issue.

When you have a conversation with more than one person, you can get multiple opinions, different points of view, and different experiences. You can combine these into a chart, and then decide what to do. You might use a combination of things you were told. Getting multiple points of view on a topic can really help with your final decision. If you ask your mother, and she tells you something positive, but ask a friend, and they say something partially negative, you can put what they did together, and create your own solution. Different experiences is essentially the same as different points of view. Having multiple can help you to create your own solution, or use one that worked for someone else.

Now that you know what you can do, who are you supposed to ask? The answer: anyone you trust. Your mother or father are the best option. This is because you are the most comfortable speaking with them, and they've lived through most of the same situations. Next, is a trusted teacher/adult. These people most likely have experience with your predicament as well. If you have friends that you trust and support you, you can ask them about your issue. They may just be able to help. Regardless of who it is, you need to trust the person.

In closing, getting many opinions on an issue can help you make good decisions, and create better outcomes to your issues. Knowing who you can speak to on these problems is very helpful as well. Having people that you can speak with makes you more confident in your decision making, so you can become an amazing problem solver. Using what other people know, and what you know can be put together to create the best possible solution. Help others when they ask you. You might not be the first person they ask, but at least they trust you enough for assistance.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
DF9580284892,"When people want to ask for ideas or advice, they sometimes go ask more than one person. Asking more than one person is better than asking just one person. If you ask one person for advice its not the best because you are only getting one idea. If you ask more than one person like 10 people than thats better because you have lots of different ideas and opinions. In my opinion asking more people is better because i get multiple opinions to help[ me make a better choice. If you feel comfortable asking just one person then do it, but having multiple opinions will help you make a better choice. So lets say you want to get advice on how to get a girlfriend. You go to your best friends house and ask him, hey whats some advice or tips on getting a girlfriend and he gives you some advice and tips. Then you go and ask your parents, elders, teachers, and more friends and they all give you a bunch of ideas and opinions on how to get a girlfriend.

A1C3D4F6E4D8,"Sixty-seven percent of people who seek multiple opinions instead of one make a better choice than others. Instead of asking just one person for their opinion, people should ask multiple people. The information gained from multiple people in much greater than from one person aswell. When asking a group of people for their opinions, the better choice is much probable to happen. Getting multiple opinions on a topic can help incredibly, the information is less biased, the outcome could be better, and the choice becomes easier to make.

Getting many opinions on a topic could give people less biased information. When asking for someones opinion, they are more likely to give you biased information. Their opinion might not be biased towards them but the information could still be biased. When someone asks multiple people for their opinions they could filter out the information and get one unbiased statement. Getting more opinions on a subject could give people less biased information.

Getting the better outcome could become more likely if someone asks multiple people for their opinion. When someone asks someone else for their opinion, they will likely give them the choice they made. The choice they made could be good but, there could be better outcomes. When asking many people for their opinion, people can decide which outcome is the best and make a better choice. When someone asks multiple people for their opinion, the better outcome can be found.

Choices become easier to make when someone asks many people for their opinion. When someone asks just one other person for their opinion, it is harder to make the decision. However, when someone asks multiple people for their opinion, they can see which choice is the best to make. Getting many opinions can help someone see which choice has given a group of people the better outcome and which has not. When someone asks multiple people for their opinion, choices become extremely easier to make.

Asking for many opinions on a subject could give someone less biased information, a better outcome, and an easier choice to make.

7A425A58F136,"When making a decision, sometimes you need to get some advice, but you might not see why that's helpful. Advice is when you take suggestions or ideas from someone about a certain decision you have to make. Whether it's from a friend or family member, advice can help in many ways. The main benefits you get from getting advice are that you see another perspective, you experience varying opinions on the subject, and you see other solutions.

Getting another perspective can be helpful when making a decision because you get to see the issue or decision through someone else's eyes. Opening your mind to new ideas and opinions can help you become a more accepting and kind person, just from this one experience. You might have one opinion your whole life, but if you experience the situation from someone else's point of view, you can see that you might have been wrong. Additionally, even if you don't change your mind because of another person's points or opinions, you still are able to accept their ideas without it bothering you that you disagree. From doing this one small thing, you can figure out how to solve your problem, and you can develop as a person, which is always a good idea, regardless of the circumstance.

You should always seek help from multiple people because it can be even more helpful than getting just one person's opinion. If you get advice from three friends, they will probably all have different answers. However, after hearing those answers, you can debate the different pros and cons of each, and, eventually, you can come to a final conclusion. Whether your solution is one of theirs or some kind of combination, you were helped by asking for multiple opinions. Also, hearing various opinions can open you up to more perspectives, which benefits you in the ways previously stated.

Seeing those other people's opinions can also lead you to see other solutions to your problem. No one has to be wrong or have the wrong opinion, so when you get the opportunity to think about other solutions, it can benefit you and maybe others. For example, if you need a new frying pan, you might think you should just go buy one from the store, but your friend could have another idea. Let's say they have two frying pans, but they only need one. If you ask for their advice, they would suggest that you should have one of theirs as they don't need or want it. Because of this, you would save money and find a solution to your problem, while also helping a friend in cleaning up their kitchen. That solution benefits both of you, showing just how helpful advice can be.

In conclusion, getting advice is always a good idea as it opens you up to new perspectives, differing opinions, and more solutions. New perspectives can open up your mind to help you not only solve your problem, but to be a better person. Also, seeing more solutions can benefit you and possibly others. And finally, getting differing opinions can help you see all sides of the argument, so you can make the right decision. From thinking about these three points, you can see that there are no downsides to asking for advice, especially from multiple people.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
7C1D05780C33,"Well,this seems like a simple question with a simple answer but knowing me ill not make this simple in the slightest. Everyone had asked for advice in there life it's common this do in daily life,but sometimes we are uncertain of the answer we get after we ask for advice. Sometimes more than one person may help with a certain problem you have or may soon have. But is talking to an extra source helpful yes, yes it is. Here ill prove it to you.

When your shopping you always wonder ''Am I getting the best price?''If not your crazy. If you do than this is one of the time multiple opinions that may help. Here is a example. your shopping for a car and the price that the dealer ship is supisously to high you would probably look for people who have that car and ask for an opinion on how much should I buy it for so you know your not being scammed out of your money or maybe you can find out a way to get a much better car at a far better price. The possibility are endless when it come to buying things. This here is another example. I have an interest in LEGOs but I always have trouble when shopping for them and its always the same problem. The price,LEGOs,they a very fun yet expensive toy,A medium sized set could be over $50! As a kid that would be all of my saving but i've found a way to get them for a far better deal than I could ever hope and I do this by asking several people during the time my neighborhood has garage sales to see if there is any way I could get my hand on some LEGOs at a great bargain that and you always have EBay.

Imagine your in school but the day before you where really sick and couldnt remember if you had a test or your homework due that that day well never fear communication is here and with it you can check all of your best sources like your friend Generic_Name or Generic_Name they are both sources you can rely on because there are your friend and they would never lead you astray,right? All jokes aside this could be super yes I said super and i'm not five but this is super helpful lets throw in another example. Your walking home when you get a text from a friend they say that spring break will now be two weeks long and your unsure but when you ask another friend and they say its two weeks long and so your convinced,but what you didnt know as well as your friends is that the school announcements were off and that there was just one week of spring break and so you now have been gone from school thinking that school was out but in reality you have just missed a whole week of school. The sad part of this story is it could have all been avoided if you just confirmed with a few more sources. This does not only apply to school though. They just the easiest of the examples.

Now I know there will be at least one person who will have no one to talk to even about this. Never fear thats why the internet is here! Seriously these day you have all of the knowledge and opinions in the world at your finger tips but not only that but hundreds of sources that will indeed confirm any question or help you with an problem or get you any advice you need. this is not the only way other than human way to ask questions and be able to confirm you answers with it books not thousands but millions of books to chose form some are for stories but many are for information,information that can be confirmed with even crossing over the internet and humans to get the best advice or information ever!

Now you know all of the many ways and reasons to get multiple responses for many things need for everyday life. So now you know that with multiple opinions and facts you can make the best choices on nearly everything except gamboling you should never get hooked on gamboling because it bad so make sure you get multiple opinions and dont gamble because its bad!",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C493B582595E,"Have you ever asked for advice?

I'm sure that you have.

Everybody needs a second opinion at some point in their life, right?

Why did you ask the people that you did?

When asking someone for help in a situation, it can be difficult if they are saying opposite of what you are thinking.

At that point, you wonder, ""Were they the wrong person to ask?"" or ""Should I go with my gut?"" or whatever.

Sometimes it is better to trust your gut and not go to other people.

Other people can influence you to second guess yourself in a situation that you're stuck in.

Why can asking for another opinion, or even asking more than person, help the brain decifer right from wrong?

This comes down to human nature.

We are born with the ability to use our brains to our advantage.

This being the case, how come it is so hard to make up our own minds about a situation that we got ourselves into in the first place?

By the time that you are mature enough to think for yourself at any level, you automatically start to second guess yourself.

Why?

This question can be used in many scenarioes, but in this one, there isn't really an answer.

When you take a deeper look into the brain, you find out that every section has a part to play.

You eventually realise that every nerve, every strand, and every circuit is important.

If you think about it hard enough, you come to the recognition of the fact that one nerve placed differently, has the possibility to rewire your your thought process.

With all of this playing a part, it proves that your brain can do the unthinkable (get it).

So, getting back on topic, if our brains can run a human body, then why can't we make our own decisions?

We make decisions every single day of our lives.

Every decision that you have aver made has lead you to this moment doing the specific thing that you are doing down to the very second.

How many tines do you think that we ask for advice just in a year?

How do we even know that the person that we ask doesn't give you the wrong advice?

How do you know when it is best to go off of your best judgement, should you get an opinion on that from someone else?

The worst part is, there really aren't answers to provide for all of these strenuous questions.

Unfortunately, that is just one more thing for you to debate in your head.

The process of asking people for advice my not be that simple, but it is a positive thing to ask for help in a situation that you dpn't know how to deal with.

Getting multiple opinions can help you decide on what you do.

Always remember that asking for ad vice is not a bad thing.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
BA18C6F80423,"If you had to make an important decision, would you go to one person and ask for their opinion or go to multiple people and ask for their opinion? In my opinion, going to multiple people and asking them for their help would be the better choice. This is true because then you'll have a variety of knowledge, based upon how other people reacted to the same situation. In addition to that, is so that you don't get a biased opinion.

One reason for seeking multiple opinions is so that people will have a variety of knowledge to choose from. This will help better prepare them when they have to choose between their options. Furthermore, it will help them face the consequences of their action. They will also know that they chose the better option based upon the opinions that they were given. Getting multiple opinions will also help them when they learn from other people's mistakes. Like, if they had to choose from going to a movie or going to study for a test. If they went to somebody who doesn't really care about the test, they will most likely choose to go to the movie. But if they ask their elder brother or sister, they would say, based on experience, don't go the movies because if you fail your test, mom and dad would ground you for a month. Then based on the opinions given to them they would choose the best choice. In addition to that, no one knows everything about the whole world. So why would someone go to one person. Maybe they don't even know anything about it and give bad advice. If they only went with one opinion and that was their first opinion and they acted on it, they would have probably chosen the worst choice and would have to face the consequences of that choice.

Another reason why people should seek multiple opinions is so that it is not biased. Going back to our first example, if that first opinion had been biased, how deep into trouble would that kid had been in if they went to the movies. Furthermore, that is from a kids point of view. What if someone wanted to make a business deal with someone else that's worth around a million dollars, and their colleague tells them to not do with that company. Well they want the deal to be perfect, since so much money is on the line. So they want to make sure the advice is actually based on cold, hard facts not flimsy opinions. That is why you should take advice from multiple people not just one. Whoever is getting advice can also cross check with someone else and see if their advice is actually worth it. Just because someone trust someone else a lot doesn't mean that they are right.

In summary, that is why I think that, when taking advice, it's best to take it from multiple people. This is true because you will then have a variety of knowledge and you won't have a biased opinion. Consequently, you won't have a hard time with choices that you are making. So based on this essay, I dare you to utilize these tactics in the real world.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

436637E5292F,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. They believe that receiving more input on an opinion is very helpful. They're not wrong for having those thoughts; in fact, getting ideas from multiple people is a smart action that can help in a myriad of ways when trying to make a better decision. This is because more input can foster better accuracy, give the questioner more options to choose from, and can offer some ethics on different opinions.

First, I stated that seeking multiple pieces of advice helps make the ultimate decision more accurate. When a person has an opinion on something, often times the opinion has little to go off of. Usually, this leads to someone misunderstanding the content of their thoughts on the matter. In some cases, bad things can occur from this. Being able to hear the platforms of others will help the questioner avoid severe misunderstandings. Having and understanding those thoughts will help in building a strong base for their opinion, saving some people from a confusing time.

Another reason why listening to what other people think is useful is because it gives the questioner different choices to choose from. Sometimes, people will prefer to go with the opinions of others instead of formulating their own. Many want to conform and fit in, while others do not have the energy to decide for themselves. Some are just unable to form an opinion on the specified topic. Whatever the reason, asking more than one person on their basis is really helpful for them. For example, someone who can't decide something can usually look up to their friends for a better choice. Someone who wants to choose a team to root for during a game but can't think of which to pick can go with the side with the majority of supporters. Seeking multiple opinions can also help with many other situations like this.

More often than not, one has already made a decision, but they're unaware of the benefits and consequences that go with their choice. Listening to others usually clears up most of those cracks. Naturally, people have their own opinions on other's decisions. By inquiring those people about their thoughts, one can easily determine the ethics of their decision. On occasion, it might make one reconsider their choice. On other occasions, it can help one feel more confident in their opinion. Basically, it is very important to know what one will be doing right and wrong with their choice.

When asking for advice on something, many find it helpful to ask multiple people. They think that with multiple answers coming from multiple backgrounds, a better decision can be made on their end. It is, in fact, a smart way to handle decision-making. Three reasons why are because it gives accuracy, more options to pick from, and the ethics that come from one's opinion.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

Asking people for advice might help you become more successful in life by taking the advice you get.

If you can understanding the advice you get it may help you make better decision, an example will be if you want to buy a house a car or a object that might cost a lot of money, you probably ask multiple people for advice and you will think about it if you are doing the right decision or not.

Asking people for advice benefits everyone because they can know your point of view and you can know their point of view, and after you guys talk to you can understand why they think that advice will benefit you and it might change your perspective towards that advice, we are all different and our opinion might change of how we think about that advice.

In conclusion, in my opinion I think that is good to ask multiple people for advice so you can choose the right thing to do, but some people might disagree with what I think, but I think it benefits you and will help you make better decisions in life.

How can asking multiple people about advice better? Sometimes the persons advice can be bad. People think differently, so it can lead to different outcomes. Not many people can understand the advice they ask for.

All in all, asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one person.

First, you could be asking someone for some advice, but it's not good advice, so you ask someone else. You can ask a random person for advice, and the give you some advice you would never do, then you ask someone else. People can ask other people for advice, because the person they ask before gave them some advice that they know they would get you in trouble. In summary, asking one person for advice and that persons advice is bad, you can always ask someone else.

Secondly, you can ask as much people as needed for advice, but they can all lead to different outcomes. You can ask your friend for advice, and they give some good advice, but your scared of the outcome, so you ask someone else. Sometimes you could be scared or nervous about the outcome of the advice someone gave you, that you ask another person. Many people think differently, and have different outcomes that you don't like, you can keep on asking other people. In total, people minds think differently, and they think about different outcomes that you are terrified or nervous about, so you ask someone else.

Third, you might not understand the advice people give you, so you ask someone else to see what they say. People can give some good advice, but at the same time say it in a way not many people can understand. Some people can think of great advice, but they don't know how to put it in words. Many kids and adults get nervous sometimes when their friend ask for advice, and they mumble or stutter what they are trying to say, and their friend can't understand what they are saying. In conclusion, not many people can understand advice other people give them.

Finally, asking multiple people what they think you should do, is better than asking one person. You can never know if the person you ask for advice, is going to give you good or bad advice. Some people give different advice, which can lead to different choices. Not many people can give advice clearly. To conclude, asking more than one person for advice is a better choice than asking one person instead.       ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

But most of the time they go to many people cause they dont know what to do in whatever problem they have. I think going to many people is a good idea cause what if all of there ideas can help you. You can chose witch ever idea of advice you like.""I also think that if you go to maybe a older person that they will be able to help more with what ever cause they might have good experience with your situation"". So in conclusion I think going to many people even old people is a good idea cause they will probably give you good advice on what you need help with. and not to be scared with going up to people for advice cause the worst thing to be scared of is not getting any help back with what your problem. Thats why i think it good to ask for advice.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
97CF6EF5FE26,"When faced with a tough decision, most people ask for multiple opinions on it. Asking numerous people for their opinion can help someone establish which choice would be best. If someone were to ask another person with lots of life experience, they'll probably get a reliable opinion on the situation. Plus, if you ask for advice from various people it's as if you're taking a poll on which choice would be best. There are several legitimate reasons to ask multiple for advice, and doing so is extremely important.

People can rely on the elderly, or more experienced people, to get credible advice in a situation. A good example would be Master Oogue, featured in the beloved movie ""Kung Fu Panda."" Po, the main character of the movie, turns to Master Oogue for advice in his situation. As a result, Po get's a valuable perspective and comes to his decision. There are numerous examples as to why someone should trust experienced people for advice.

When a person asks for various perspectives, they will most likely go by the advice most people have aforementioned. Everyone goes through different experiences and events. So, asking more people will have a more successful outcome. Asking multiple people gives you a more impartial opinion and will not be affected by unusual bias.

In several ways, asking many people for advice can be a good idea. Doing so will give a better perspective on the situation. Also, asking more experienced people will ensure the chance of getting reliable advice. Overall, there are several reasons why someone should ask for various opinions.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
0EE6F614F2F0,"Have you struggled and asked someone to help? People often do this to search for the answer or an alternative. Seeking more than one opinion can provide someone with better choices because it gives them a new perspective and can better themselves.

One way multiple opinions helps to get better choices is gaining a new perspective. First, someone with the help of others can find out new and improved ways to solve the problem. A new way to solve can lead to a completely new and beneficial solution. This can result into the right choice to make. Secondly, someone who knows more than you about a subject can reinforce their idea, so the opinion seems better and more reliable. For example, if someone asked an old science professor about the parts of a plant cell, the professor will be able to answer that question confidently and reliably because they've been teaching science for a long time. This proves that getting an professional opinion can help others with their choices. Thirdly, peers could influence perspective and help with better choices. Others often trust a close and helpful friend rather than a random person. Overall, looking at a new perspective can better someone's choices by finding a new solution, getting professional guidance, and gaining the help of fellow peers.

Another way of improving the choices others make is to strengthening themselves by listening to others. People can improve themselves and the choices they make by listening to constructive criticism and feedback. For instance, I asked people to review my project and I was told some feedback. I learned from that experience, improved my abilities and I now make the right choices when I work on projects. Not to mention, people can help make better choices by getting emotional support from others. Someone could be going through a rough time and not making the best choices, but they can search for multiple view points from others. This can result in people helping that person out and leading them to conduct better choices. Lastly, people can help make improved choices by gaining motivation. Motivation from others could help someone keep pushing forward and make correct choices, so that they can improve and learn. In conclusion, getting multiple opinions can improve someones choices by listing to feedback and criticism, getting emotional support, and gaining motivation.

Getting a lot of ideas and opinions can give someone better choices and opportunities because it gives a fresh view point and can improve ones self. People consult other people to find better choices and in doing so, usually benefits the people involved. All in all, an open perspective and improvement in themselves is why gaining multiple opinions helps result in good choices.    ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
EF1E56E86D9B,"How can seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice? It can help the person make a better choice because the more advice or opinions you give to that person the harder they think about what choice their gonna take. But not in all cases it's the same because everyone is different and every person has a different mindset,It can help people in a good way and in a bad way.

For example if a person who was seeking opinions or advice about what car to buy, they would ask for opinions from their family or friends about whats a great deal or price on a car?,Is it in good condition?,Does it have good mileage? Because that person doesnt want to buy a car thats not gonna be worth buying and, Their can be so many opinions and that would make the person think really hard about what decision he's gonna take because not everyone is gonna have the same opinion about the same car.

Many people can make bad choices too,like for example if teenager was to dropout of high school and didn't ask for opinions and advice about the situation he would most likely pick the bad choice and regret It after. If he wouldve gotten multiple opinions from people,they would tell him not dropout of school and they would explain their reasons why he shouldnt pick that route or choice and that person would really think about it and would think about the consequences.

Another example can be about having a baby a lot of people would have very different reasons if you should have a baby or not and depending on your age. If the person is around the age 21 they should ask a lot of their family members of what they think about having a baby,and if your asking yourself this, why should we ask for multiple opinions from our family members or parents? Because there those kinds of people who probably have already gone through that situation. And its best to ask people who have gone through a lot stuff because they might ve gone through really bad stuff or made really bad choices in there past and they would probably would be glad to help you out to make the better choice then they did.

Overall I think seeking multiple opinions and talking to more than one person can really help you out in a lot different ways and dont get me wrong their are cons too but I wouldnt say there are more pros because everyone has different opinions and advice. It can make a lot of people successful in life and in many other things too just because they took peoples advice and listened to their opinions. It can make other people make bad choices too probably because they took the wrong advice from the wrong person or didnt even ask for opinions or advice.           ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
57A68036E7F5,"Asking people for advice can be hard work. So hard, in fact, that you are tempted to ask only one person. However, this may not be the best option. The most optimal technique for gaining advice is to ask as many people as possible, and to follow the advice that you feel is best. Here is some advice on how to ask for advice:

When seeking advice, turn to who you feel are your most credible sources. Teachers, parents, and trusted adults can all lend you helpful tidbits of information. People usually give advice to you as if they were giving it to their past selves, so advice tends to be full of bias. There are also a lot of many-sided ethical dilemmas that have completely different answers depending on who you ask.

Always follow the advice that makes the most sense to you. When people are throwing their opinions out there, they will usually tell you what works best for them. For example, when asking for advice about how to study, not every tip is going to apply to you, because everyone has different learning styles. You might want to ask many people and only use the advice that you like most, or that you feel would work for you.

If you are too shy about asking for advice, you may be tempted to look on the internet. Do not look on the internet first. Always ask your parents or other trusted adults before embarking on the quest to find advice on the internet. You may find articles written by random strangers who are writing for a much older audience with different needs or wants than you. Since they are writing mostly for everybody, they will not consider everybody's needs, and will speak for the default demographic.

Remember to always ask more than one person for advice, and to follow the advice that you feel would help you the most. Ask parents and trusted adults before consulting anyone else, and especially before consulting the internet. Armed with this new toolkit of knowledge, you are now ready to ask for advice the right way!",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
E5C524E8ECB8,"Do you think asking more than one person for advice is a good idea?

Well I think it is, believe it or not when you ask people for advice they have been through the same situation.

Going to ask for advice from more than one person is important.

When you want more advice you should talk to your parents, friends , or a older sibling.

The first person you should talk to is your parents because they are way older than you and they have had more experience with these type of situation.

They also know you better than anyone would because they have raised you and know what the best way for you is. The last reason you should talk to your parent is because they have most likely gone through this problem before which means that they know what will work the best and what wouldn't work.

Most of the time when you ask your parents for advice they give you what solves the problem.

The second person I would recommend talking to is a trusted friend.

They can give you some good advice because you spend almost 6 hours with them at school so they know what happening around you during school.

They would also be pretty honest with you because they want to give you advice that is good for you and that would help.

The final reason to talk with a friend or friends is because this is someone who you can talk to if you don't want to talk about it with you parents and you want to see what they would say before mentioning it to you parents.

The final person I would go talk to is an older sibling.

I would talk to them because they have been in your shoes many times.

So the advice they would give you would help you because it helped them.

Also they can keep this away from your parents.

Not only are they going to give you advice one what you asked them but they can keep it away from your parents until your ready to ask them.

Finally I would ask an older sibling for advice because they are older for a reason.

They most likely are there to help you when you need to so I would use it while you can before they either leave for college or already have left.

If you ask more people you can get the same pr different responses from the people. you had seen a cute girl but you don't know what to do so you need some help to make something and you need advice on how to make it.

Let's say that your in a small town but you just move here and you son had seen a cute girl so he ask he's dad if he knew any advice for him to make a move. He's dad had some good advice but the son want more advice like who do I get her to like me back so we went to get some more advice from is family. The son went to is grandpa first then is uncle and they both said the same thing to but the his dad's advice was totally different. The second week of school the son had had seen her again probably because she is in his class the day went on and on then the school day's over and the boy went home. Before the boy left the school a different girl came up to him but he rejected her and carried his day back home and told his dad what happened at school. the dad's son sawed his younger brother who is one year younger than him but he sawed him crying so he ask him what had happen at school and the brother told him.

So the brother told his younger brother that his girlfriend just broke up with him and said that the girl that ask you out was my girlfriend. None of this would have happened if you staid in your grade and stayed of moving up two grades and almost taking my girlfriend. The younger brother told that he said no to her and wanted a other girl but not her because he knew that his younger brother was dating her for the past few years. Three years later the brothers are in the same school but different grade the older brother is now one grade above than the younger brother and the younger brother got the girl he had a crush on.

when the two brothers got really old and they had to use wheel chairs to get where their going the brothers still had their girlfriends. But the younger brother got married and the other brother did't because his girl died in a hospital from smoking. Then the older brother died from a car crash by a drunk driver on the interstate and is younger and only brother was very sad when he died so now he is the only boy left in the family besies the dad and uncle oh and the grandpa died to because of age.

BE68B9E53CCB,"I believe that when people ask for advice they should talk to multiple people because they will all have different ideas and experiences. I will touch on these two main points and give examples using books and other useful pieces of information.

You can benefit from others ideas because they might have solved whatever problem you are facing in a different way. One example of this is from the book

Ranger's Apprentice: Siege of Maldor . I might have the title wrong. Anyway in the book the protagonist Will is in a forest surrounding a fortress. He is with a friend of his, Malacose. The name might be wrong as well. One of his other friends has been captured and been taken to the fortress. So then Will and Malacose worked together to come up with a way to save his friend. Will came up with the a plan to take the fortress. He used Malacose's idea to use small explosions and other nonlethal props and sound devices to distract the enemy so Will and another of his friends Horace could slip into the castle mostly unnoticed. Then once they had secured a foothold. Then they unleashed more of Will's friends, Skandians to help them take the fortress.. Another example is from the book Ranger's Apprentice Battle for Skandia. In this book the Skandians are being invaded by an army that has never lost a battle. So the Skandians go to Halt and Will for help. Actually it was Halt and Will who told them that the Temuji were coming. Anyway Halt had experience with the Temuji so he came up with a plan that was very unskandian like. But the Skandians agreed to it because it was their only hope. The Temuji were horse people so their ideal battlefield was on an open plain. Also one of their favorite tactics was to fake a retreat to draw out the enemy but then to cut them down with a ambush. That then would draw out more of whoever they were facing and repeat the process. So Halt used that agent them and staged a ambush for their ambush. Short version the Skandians used Halt's ideas even though it was not something they would normally do and came out victories.

This is why I believe that you can learn a lot from someone else's experiences to help you. My first example is from the book

Ranger's Apprentice: Ruins of Gorlan . I think this title is correct. We are still with Will. So he, his teacher Halt, a Baron and a Battle master are at the ruins of Gorlan. Halt and the Baron are wounded and the Battle master is petrified with fear. They are all this way because of a creature. I forget what it's called so, yeah. the beast is about to kill the three when Will who is standing a ways off recalls a lesson Halt taught him. The beast's fur was highly flammable. So he lit his arrow on fire and shot the beast. Thus saving the three and killing off the last of those creatures. My second example is also from the Ranger's Apprentice series.

Rangers Apprentice Battle of Nejon Ja ,

or something that sounds like that but is not spelled that way. So Will and Horace are in Nejon Ja and are in a run down fortress and are expecting to be attacked at the end of the Winter because the enemy cannot get to them because they way is blocked by snow and ice. All they have are some untrained natives to protect themselves and the emperor whose warlords turned against him because he was working to raise the natives who were with him at that moment to have greater rights. Then Will remembers a training and fighting style that was easy to master and was based on working as a unit not as a individual, which is the way the enemy fought. So Will used his past experience to help them train the natives quickly and helped them win. That was why I believe it is beneficial to use your past experience which leads me to the conclusion.

To sum things up Will and the Skandians used others advice also known as ideas and were victorious and Will used things he had learned to outsmart his opponents. This is why I believe you should always listen to others advice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
C10C76A6A14D,"If I'm making a really important decision I like to ask a wide variety of people what they think. Most of the time it consist of a close friend, an adult, and maybe my younger sibling. Normally, I already have a decision I'm leaning toward, but I like to find what others think in case I'm missing something. They might be thinking of something I haven't thought of yet or an option that wasn't apparent to me. I think seeking opinions from multiple different people can be very beneficial because it gives you a different point of view, helps you get opinions from people with more life experience, and helps you come to a more well rounded decision.

When you ask for the opinions of others it can help you understand different points of view in your situation. Not just where you're coming from, but how others involved in the situation might see things. That can be extremely helpful to make sure your not hurting anyone or looking over a vital piece by making your decision. Also, other people have different thought processes, so they might think of an option that you haven't yet. This gives you an entirely different way of thinking about things. Talking to different people adds sparks of creativity to your decision, and opens your mind to understand that things might not have to be black and white.

Talking to all these different people gives you an opportunity to talk to people of different age groups who have more life experience then you. Asking people younger than you helps you because they have a open and free flowing mind. They might give you the simplest answer that never crossed your mind. Talking to your peers about things is also helpful. They understand how your peers react with one another, so he/she can help you get a prospective close to something another peer would say. Reaching out to your elders I find to be the most important. They have a lot more life experience then you, and there is a possibility that they have gone through something similar. They can give a lot of important advice just from their past experiences and things they have done growing up. Plus, sense what happened is in the past they already know the outcome of their decision, so they can share it with you to pass on what they either did right or wrong. This way either kind of advice in beneficial, if they found they did something wrong you know to stay away from that option, and if they found they did something right you know to consider it.

All of these different types of advice and thought processes really help to make a well rounded and thought out decision. Once you have talked to many different types of people and received their opinions you can weigh out your options. Pooling together all the angles of the situation to find out what you have to do, and to make a decision that is best for yourself. I think that even though sometimes having everyone give you advice can be other whelming, it really helps you to look at your situation in different ways and find all of your options. All of these things are really helpful to come to a decision you feel strong about and you know is right.

In conclusion, I believe taking into account multiple opinions is very important. If you ask different people you'll end up getting all different views on the topic, which you might not have thought of. Also, by asking others, it gives you an opportunity to get opinions from people that have more life experience then you, and people that might have gone through the same thing your going through. Lastly, all their input along with your personal preferences can help you form a well rounded and though out decision. I think seeking opinions from others is vital to having an open mind and seeing all the possibilities.  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B939C9FDDAB0,"Finding a wise person for advice can be challenging, everyone needs advice sometimes, but taking it from the wrong people can be punishing. Many people can share their experiences with you, along with offering a good path to follow. Listening to a person's advice is helpful, however, you should try and formulate different opinions to make a custom one. Hearing similar situations leads to many rewarding outcomes: practice for the future, formulating your own opinion, and learning experiences.

Once you have found the best way to help your situation, you can apply this to future problems. Being able to fix current issues with past solutions makes you trust yourself more. Having more of this practice and different outcomes will make things easier each day. For example, you left your homework on the table and now you can't turn it in. Your mother and friend provide you with advice; your mother suggested you keep all homework in a folder, and your friend says you should just do your homework before class. You should depend on the reliable advice that you know will work. Your homework might be a long packet, which is better to do at home and put in a folder. Having this advice will help you keep up with your homework for a long time.

When getting advice from multiple people, it may not be exactly what you're looking for or be too confusing. You don't always have to follow what people tell you to do; instead you can combine them into a personal solution. This is a good way to fit into what you're comfortable with. You should not have to do exactly what someone else does, however, you can make an improvised solution from their actions. You can stretch out your bubble, and stay inside it at the same time. It is very comforting to know you can be independent and form a personal solution.

When making a choice, there are rewards and consequences. Mistakes are not always horrible, you can learn from them as well. Applying these mistakes and learning experiences will help you make better choices. A more positive outlook on your mistakes is seeing them as a gift. The gift of wisdom is a good thing, and knowledge is gained with it. As long as you don't revert back to the bad habits and choices, you grow strong mentally.

Overall, having different opinions and hearing many different experiences is good. Having dependable sources make you grow as a person gaining lessons, practice for future issues, along with custom solutions.                 ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

So you go around you ask friends their responses are all different you dont know what to do. So you have to find a another person to help you out.

Dying your hair a different color is not an easy task, you need to decide from the hundreds of shades and colors they have for you to use. Between simple colors like Blue, Red, Blue and Black. You need multiple people to ask what color you should get but, what if those people all choose different colors for you to use. This is why you need multiple opinions.

You keep going, you wanted to dye your hair in the first place so you need to figure out what your gonna do. You're gonna narrow down your list to less and ask 5 people again what color should I dye my hair?

After getting multiple opinions you are going to get your hair the color blue. Most of your friends said you should get it blue. They helped you settle what color you should dye your hair.

I also think that asking more than one person is a great thing, because seeking multiple opinions can help make better choices, make sure all the facts are right, or if someone is wrong about something.

The way seeking multiple opinions and help you make better choices is by one person my say all these good thing about one collage and another person might tell say the complete opposite of that. Even if that wasn't enough to make the decision which collage to go to it would never hurt to get a third opinion. It can also be at a job that may not be the best but just by getting someone else say in that job it could possibly change anyone point of view on that job and it could help them make their decision easier. Adults and young adults may need help by picking a new car out, because car are really expensive and there is a lot to look at like the gas, how many miles, and the amount the car cost. Those are big things to look at when buying a car and a young adult may not know about all those things so they my just ask their mom, dad, or even their grandparents. With young adults they can make some pretty bad decisions and serious ones to like taking drugs. Many teems think that taking drugs wont effect them or they wont get addicted but before they think about doing drugs they should ask a trusting friend that is a good influence and hear what they have to say.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can be help is when doing a paper and looking at different web sites. When on Wikipedia not all their fact are true, because anyone one can go on there and put whatever they want to. So thats its always good to go to more than one website when researching something. In school not all the teachers think alike clause when asking for help by one teacher they my tell you this is the answer but when going to another teacher they may think other wise but this doesnt always happen because most of the teachers know what their doing.

The last way seeking multiple opinions can also help with small thing like picking out clothes or what bag of chips to get. It may just seem like a bag of chips but when asking one friend to see if the new pringles chips are good or not and they say no but your other friend says they are the best thing in the world. So then when asking your third friend they say they are the best thing to so when trying them they were actually the best thing ever. Its little things like that can make change someones future because now their kids are going to grow up eating those chip and so on.

D16B647E363E,"Many people ask for advice in their lifetime. When it comes to asking for advice it could lead you to success or even failure. When people ask for advice they could get the right or even the wrong answer. Advice is not just a simple thing most people ask because they are clueless on what to do. It is a good idea to ask multiple people for advice in ways like it gives you more than one way on how to do something, someone might have a better opinion, and one person could have better experience on the topic you are talking about.

One of the reasons that seeking multiple opinions can help someone is by having more than one right way on how to do something. By having more options open it can help someone handle the decision better from just having one idea. In order to having many ideas you would need to ask people around you for their opinion. With having more than one way on how to do something it can be good in anything you do. Most people like having multiple ideas on a topic because it helps them figure it out better. When people give you more than one way you dont always have to take the more reasonable advice, take the one that you think will help you at the end of the day. In the end having more options to choose from can lead you to success and to making the right decision.

Although, having more options to choose from is better, someone might have a better opinion to give to you. With someone having a better opinion they could affect the decision in more ways than one. For instance, if your best friend has one idea but another peer has a better approach you would go with the idea that works the best. Sometimes in life the people you that think will have the best advice might not have advice for you at all, so you would have to make the choice yourself or find somebody that you normally wouldnt ask for advice. After all having better opinions on things can help you out more ways than you could imagine.

Another way how asking multiple people for advice can help you make a better decision is that someone might have past experience with the situation. Asking someone that has experience with it can help you make a better and quicker choice than from someone who does not have the experience. People with experience often help those in need of their advice. For example if you ask your parents for advice and they dont know what to tell you, you could ask other family members that would know exactly what to say. Giving advice is sometimes like cheating on a test, it could help you out deeply or it could turn around and hurt you. Always ask someone who has experience with the situation rather than from someone who does not because it could help you out in the long run.

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is a good thing to do. Trying new ways to ask for advice can most likely always help you find the advice you really need. As showed asking multiple people for advice is good because it gives you more than one way for something, someone might have a better opinion, and someone could have more experience. Good advice has helped people over the years in different ways and it continues to do so.

Most of all asking someone for advice is a key to when you are trying to make a big decision.    ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
58647D4AF653,"I think that seeking opinions for multiple people is a good idea ,for its kind of that voting if most of the people that you've ask says the same thing it must or most likely true, Another reason I think it a good idea is because it can help you get out of a bad relationship, My Last reason i think asking multiple people for there opinion is it is voting because some people loves there country and wants the best for it some people don't (people that vote for Donald Trump). So really it can be good and bad.

Have you ever just didn't know what to wear and then you ask people on the phone, your mom, your dad, your granny, and even your favorite uncle, and then half of them say wear the left one then to say wear the right one which one would you pick?.... THE LEFT ONE RIGHT . See asking people to help is fun (well at least to me).Did you see this thing on instagram where you can put 2 or more oppsions and then te people that view it can vote then which ever oppsion has the most vote you have to do it its pretty fun if you ask me (mostly youtubers do that). Sometimes doin that it is bad take me for example I had this friend named Generic_Name and I asked her whether I should wear the dark blue jeans or the light blue jeans she said the light ones then I came to school with the light jeans and I had a bottom locker so I got on my knees so I can open my like and then someone must have spilled some coffee and my pant where covered in coffe and Generic_Name starting laughing and it wasn't funny and that mde me mad thats when my mom told me not to trust nobody but the man above.

By the way that last paragraph was my first reason anyways my second reason i think asking people for help ,for it can help you get out of a bad relationship becacuse it can be abuse, no love in the reltionship, and one of them could be cheating. You never know it can be very hard for a person to get out of a bad relationship. That why when you watch a terrible relationship move most of them ask there mom for advice or the friends oe who ever they be talking to and by the end they're are out the the realstionship.

My very last reason I think asking for advice from multiple people is a good thing, for its just like voting. In this paragragh im going to be talking about how its bad and good. Sometimes voting can be bad or good becasue we never know what type of president we'll really get so it is bad but sometimes good. When peopl vote the can vote for a bad pesident (Trump) or a good president (Obama). Just like what i said in paragragh one whne ou get more votes there is a president when you get less ther not the president. I never heard of a president geting a tie though.

In conclusion asking for advice from multiple people can be good or bad you never know. Also it can be very hard to choose bewteen because you can' pick both in this world. One more thing you can't trust just everybody. Good can be simple things and bad can be simple things. I meant to put this in the relationship paragraph but the about asking for advice from a terrible relatioship is when you tell you friend or even you own mother can say just stick around it will get better just be a good wife or husband.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
B934F3106FCB,"When people ask for advice they automatically just trust the opinion of others but also ask many others for their opinions and here is why...

People will trust an indavujal but not trust their opinion, Because the little part of you disagrees and that is natural you are two totally different people. You will go to others to weigh out their opinion and see which one is better you could get two opinions one person is foolish lets say you just asked them first. The other person is wise will you follow the first opinion or go seek out another. Which will be a wise opinion from a wise person or a opinion from a foolish person. However everyone wants a wise persons advice but what if that foolish person. Has a wiser moment in that opinion than the wise one, you will never know when one is truly wise unless. You take the time to see for yourself The foolish one may be the wiser one does not matter their intelligence the only thing that. Really matters is their opinion and the reason behind it so seek out both opinions and truly see which opinion fits the description of what your looking for in an answer. For example, if you only take one opinion than you wont have anything weigh out in the end. You dont only have to seek out only two you can do as many as you like just write them own and see which was is the best way to go.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
BF01FFEF8CB3,"When you ask for advice, you ask multiple people right? I do. One of the reasons why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because when you ask more than one people for advice, they mostly give you different ideas and the more ideas you get from people the easier it feels to make that choice. Another reason why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is that when you ask different people for advice they would give you their own opinions about that choice. For example, if you ask your friend for advice for a choice you are going to make, that friend might tell you something positive about it, in the other hand, if you ask another friend for advice for a choice they might tell you something bad about it which will be way different than what your other friend said. The third reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if one person told you a negative advise and the other person told you a positive advise, you could pick which one you think is helpful. The fourth reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if you ask a friend for advice they can tell you their personal thoughts about that choice and if you ask another person they might give you their personal thoughts about it. For example, if you ask a friend to tell you if you should do your homework or not that friend might say ""No dont do your homework and lets hang out"" ,in the other hand, if you ask your other friend if you should do your homework or not he might say ""Yes do your homework because if you dont you might get a bad grade"", and then you would have to pick which one is better for you. To conclude, if you realy need advice, you should ask multiple people so then you could get more ideas.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.2
8A00BBFCFABB,"Why is it better to get advice from multiple people to help someone make a better choice? It's important to get multiple opinions from anyone because you can have more open options and have a idea on what would be better for you in the future and you wouldn't feel helpless and depressed no matter what the situation your in.

Most importantly, when you have more options your most likely to wait and observe all those options and see which one would fit your needs the best. When getting advice from someone you would probably play it out in your head and ask yourself, is this the best choice for me? Asking yourself what option would positively help the outcome of my situation. In that case your gonna need/want multiple advice from different people. Then, you would want to think how that might effect your future in the long run. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen between you or someone just because it helped you in the end. Try and solve the problem by understanding yourself and that other person,like you would want good outcomes for both of you and for no one to be hurt. After,your gonna want to know that that was the best choice for you so that the situation was completely resolved. It might effect somethings good or bad. But in that way you would learn from it and know that maybe that certain option wasn't the best to fit your needs. Open and multiple opinions are always gonna be better than having one because there will always be a better chance of having a problem figured out.

Additionally, asking for advice won't make you feel helpless or depressed. Most people these days suffer from depression because they think they don't have anyone to turn to and nothing is gonna help them in anything they're caught up in. Opening up and talking to people can re leave that feeling. Asking people for help and advice on what to do. First,asking others for options would make the situation less stressful and you wouldn't have to feel alone. Sometimes when you do have more than two or three ideas, those ideas can surprisingly make a better impact on the situation. You have better ways to see the outcome because of that opinion you followed through with. All together,the situation can be resolved or it won't have to be a big deal like it was before that made you feel uncertain. All those opinions and advice you took can make your life so much easier and make you feel less worried. Taking the advice,using it, and letting it help you and the situation can take off any negative energy you felt towards yourself. You can be unbothered and be happy that you no longer have to take care or think of what you had to go through . So basically letting other people help you and your needs can take off so much stress off you shoulders and you wouldn't have that feeling of being empty all the time because you have no idea on what to do or if anything can help at all.

So because asking people for multiple opinions and seeing how it can effect your future and feeling less stressed or depressed, there will always be a better chance for you to make a better choice and have almost anything solved. It's better to have help from others and not just ask yourself all the time for advice that would probably stay the same. You need to have different ideas and thoughts to play out so you have a higher chance for something better.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
A868395AEAAB,"Have you ever wondered why people seek for other peoples opinions, well this paper will explain the reason behind it. This paper will also go through the logic behind it and three reasons people do it so often. The reason people look for other's opinions is because it gives people a new perspective, allows them to compare choices and gives them a good idea of what the choice or answer is.

The first and most common reason people seek other people's opinions is they just want a new perspective. There is a lot of people who want a new perspective because they want somthing fresh or they want to understand the other side. Most people have learned that ""Asumption is the mother of all failures."" and for that reason people seek other peoples opinions so they make the best choice with the info they have. Because if you do not know the reasons or do not understand the other side or answer, it can lead you down a path of failure or leave you with the wrong answer. This is why people seek for a new perspective/opinion.

The next reason people seek out other's opinions is they want something to compare their answer or another answer to. Comparing answers and opinions can give you insight on a topic or idea and give you a sence of whats wrong and whats right. Because say you have one opinion/answer and compare them, you can see what matches the other in both answers and from that can decide what is the best choice. Most people like to list the pros and cons out and compare and do stuff like that and it does help and it easy to do. This is why people seek for opinions to compare.

The final reason is just to have a better understaning and a good idea of what is right. Because most people seek for those opinions on the though of getting a better understanding or just understanding it in the first place. Because if they understand a topic better their more likely to pick a better choice or answer on that topic. What was stated in the first paragragh also comes in here, people always are looking fo a new way to look at things and look at things from multiple angles. Looking at thing fron different ways and perspectives can give you and idea of the right choice or just straight out tell you.

In conclusion, getting new perspectives, comparing opinions and getting good idea of whats right. These are the reasons people seek out other opinions and answers, but these are just some of them. So when you don't know the right choice or answer, it never bad to ask someone.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
0B3BA24EAF48,"Making Better Choices

Decision and choices are things we all have to make, but why can't they be easier? Asking one's opinion on something can shine a light on something that was once not thought of, they can also persuade you to a decision that they see fit, and if you ask multiple people, you can find the popular opinion.

Starting off, shedding light on a new topic can be helpful because if you have never thought about this option, then it could help you come to a final verdict. Second, this thing that has been brought up, may show you why picking one of the choices could negatively impact you. It can also show you a different way of thinking. This thing can provide to you why something is a better choice than the other.

Next, if someone can persuade you to an option, it can make the choice seem easier, as if it's not all on you. Now, when someone tries persuades you, they try to give you the option they think is right, and if you trust them and believe in them, they can lead you down the right path. If you believe in that persons choice, then it could make them think that you really trust them.

My last reason, if you find several peoples opinion on one thing, you can find the popular opinion. Finding the popular opinion can show you what ever one thinks is a better choice. It can show you that you are making the right choice. The popular opinion of all these people can also show you why the choice you were making is wrong. If you chose the popular opinion, then it makes you feel confident that you have made the right choice.

In conclusion, I think it is better to have multiple peoples opinions because it can show you something new, they can help you come to a decision, and they can show you the popular opinion.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
1DD5B206DC55,"When you make a decision without advice, you are trusting that you have enough background knowledge to make a wise choice. When you ask more than one person for advice you are expanding your knowledge so you can make a better choice. The more people you ask, the more knowledge you have of a situation. Everyone has some advice to give, it might even be worth your while to find out what that is. Just remember to check for bias when asking multiple people.

As an example, you go to the store to buy your favorite product, but someone tells you it is cheaper at another store. You can make the best choice by asking someone else what they think, this saves time when you find out that it is not cheaper. When listening to someone else's advice make sure you listen for bias. If that person who told you it was cheaper here than at the other store, then they might have been bias against the other store. They would lie to you so you would avoid the other store.

Every person sees from a different set of eyes, we all have a different view for every situation. When asking for advice you should always consult more than one person. If they have some different insight to a situation, they will share that knowledge with you, helping you make better choices. Those choices could help you reach your goals or even reach the stars",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
34CC756C2707,"When people ask for advise they often ask more then one person so they can get the best advise possible.

I think that people should ask multiple people for advise because they feel that different people will have different ideas about something, so if they ask multiple people they get good advise that is not flawed.

Some examples of people asking for advise from Several people are, when I wanted to get a new fishing rod one of the workers said that the one I was looking at was very durable, but then I looked up the reviews of the product online and people said that It broke within a month of them getting it. Another example is when my brother and I wanted to get a new shiftier for our racing simulator, we looked at a video of someone who bought one that we were looking and they said that they did not like it and that it was poorly made. After we watched that video we looked at some other videos on it and they said that it was one of the best ones you could buy for a reasonable price. One final example of why you should always ask multiple people for advise is when my family and I went to a karting shop to get some new parts that had worn on our karts, when we got there we knew exactly which ones were good and bad because we asked people at the racetrack for advise on which parts we should get, most of them agreed on what parts we should and should not get.

Some details of why you should get more than one persons opinion are that some people are bias with their opinion, for example one person might think that one thing is better to do just because that is what they do even though it may not be the best thing to do. Also some people may not have good advise for you if they never had to do something similar or they just dont know what you are asking them about. One more thing is that one person might just give you bad advise even if they dont mean to, so asking for lots of peoples opinions would be good so you have a higher chance of getting good advise.

I believe that you should ask for multiple pieces of advise so you get the best advise possible.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
608A0F691705,"Have you ever asked your friends and family for their opinions? When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Advice is very bias but can help in many situations. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. It allows them to see the differences and similarities in the advice given from multiple people, hear many different ways to solve the problem, and one persons advice may not be the way hey want to handle the situation.

To begin with, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows them to see the differences and similarities in the the advice given. For example, you ask your friend for advice about you and your spouse. Your friend tells you to try and talk with your lover about it. Then, you ask your mother and her opinion is the same as your friends. This shows the similarities in the opinion and it seems not to be as bias. There also can be differences in advice. Say the same situation happens but instead your mother tells you to ignore the person. You now have two ways to respond to the problem.

Second, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows you to hear many different point of views. Hearing many different ways to solve a problem allows you to choose what you think is best. For example, your dog runs away and you dont know what you should do. Your best friend, mother, father, and sister all give you different opinions on how they would find your dog. At first, you wanted to go look for the dog on the streets like your sister said but instead you use your best friends advice which is to put posters all around town. Different opinions can keep you safe while also fixing the problem.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions can help someone maker a better choice because one persons opinion may not be the way you want to handle the situation. Opinions are someones personal beliefs and you may not agree with what they tell you. Asking many people gives you a better perspective of ways to handle the problem. For example, a girl is talking about you in school. All of your friends say you should fight her, but your mother says it's just a waste of time and to not worry about it. If you were to only ask your friends for their opinion you may have been suspended from school. This is why asking more than one person is very helpful!

Seeing the differences and similarities in the advice given from multiple people, hearing many different ways to solve the problem, and one persons advice may not be the way hey want to handle the situation are all reasons why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Opinions help you solve everyday problems that you may not even think about. Opinions can also keep you safe and out of trouble. Sometimes you many not agree with the opinion while other times you will. Asking many people for their opinion will allow you to make better choices throughout your whole life.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Another example why seeking advice is a good thing is because multiple advice helps you decide what is for the better and not a bad thing if theres something bad about that advice ask someone else what they think about that advice. Lastly seeking for one example is bad because if you go along an advice and don't do so well after you won't want another person to give advice instead you ask multiple people and they tell you something different and you agree with it and you plan what would happened if you do this and that. One important thing about asking for advice ask advice to the people you trust not the other way because they might give you a bad advice and embarrass you and you don't want that. This are my reason why seeking multiple advice are good and what not to do. an example of asking for good advice is imagine I have to retake a test and I ask a bunch of friends what to do. some people are going to tell me to cheat and others are going others tell me to study I would think about each advice and see if I study would I pass and not get in trouble or cheat and if I get in trouble I have to take responsibility.

14EA20764FD8,"Sometimes, when people ask more than one person for advice they try to see what to do to help them . And seeking multiple opinions can help because, when a person dont know what to do they need somebody to help them , guide them, and show them the right way. and taking advice from from muliple people just might help them beacuse what if the advice you took from Generic_Name might be better than Generic_Name., because Generic_Name ,might told you exactally what to do , how to do it, when to do it but, Generic_Name just told you to keep your head up and wait the right time..taking advice from more than one person can be a good thing , some people need muliple people to talk to to get where they need to get. making better choices sometimes u cant do it by yourself.. everybody needs that one person to help them and guide them but you never know who might tell you to do the right thing. some people just wanna know whats going on with you and really ain't trying to help better yourself or make the right choice so its only right to feel ok to get advice from more than one person , and really it dont even have to be a whole lot of people, one,two or maybe three got enough. beacuse i know how it felt to be alone.

And, another thing when a person asking for advice they sometimes lost,confused,going thru something or even worst and need people to just help them, one person help but i really feel that having Atleast two people you can run to to help you or give you goof advice beacusee, what if that one persom you ONLY talk to busy , working , having family time and cant talk right now or help you make a good choice that why its always good to to have muliple people u trust around to help u at all times. thats the most best feeling ever knowing u have somebody you can trust with your persona stuff or even what u have in mind to do..without everybodying knowing before u tell them.

Third, Hepling others always been ok and a good thing so when people ask me for advice i always be ok with it . if anybody even needed a hug i don't be caring cause helping others is OK. caring and giving your time is always been ok and being there for a person always been ok. you never know when you might need somebody or need advice from somebody. so always be nice ad never rude to somebody cause you never know when its your time and u might need somebody to talk to, vent too, need adive from or a shoulder to cry on. respect them love them n tell them whats the right thing to do. when you help people good things come your way. like once again ain't NOTHING wrong with helping eachers and giving out the best advice.. it should make u feel good and happy at yourself for helping out others and there problems.

Trust, Trust is another thing. if you have trust u dont have anything or you dont need to texting or talking to that person cause trusting somebody u giving all your business too or wanted help from them .,and for them to know everything is important..learn people, buld a bond,get to know well ! because, its NOT ok for you to be friends or anything with a person u cant trust. you need to watch and learn evrybody to talk to, think before to tell people u business..and even if you and that person fall out you shouldn't haven to worry about them telling everuthing yall talked about to next person, the trust gone remain soild and everything gonna be fine. but if you dont have trust and yall fall out and they tell everything you gonnna have trust issues amd its gonr make it hard fro you to ask anybody for advice . because, of that main situation..

Commuication, when talking to somebody having a serioud talk always have good commuication with them cause if you texting them dry, late and constanly saying the bsame thing over i really feel like that's disrespectful . because if that person feeling comfortable to tell you whats going on with them and you not playing attention, on your phone,taking long to text back, etc. i will feel a certain way, so when giving advice to someone give them all your attention and tell them whats right. give them all you ! the honest truth on how u feell and what they shoukd do to help they situation get better and you gotta also help them . with anything, cant let that person down.

Teamwork,always be there for that person no matter what. help them with whatever they need to you. stay on there side always. lead them in the right direction..if even going out on dates , having date nights at home, being on the phone for hours help. be there for them everybody neds somebody they can always run too no matter how many days they went without talking , no matter how manys days they went without seening that person.. no matter whatt. teamwork is good and good for there friendship, bring joy into that person life , try help healing. help them make good choices help them to do good in life. help with anything they need. ain't nothing like a health frienship bond. knowing u have somebody that give good advice and help u make good choices. respect each ,other love each other and never give up on each other! ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
94BD9432CA7C,"Looking for multiple opinions can help someone make a good choice because it allows different ideas, help, trust, and inspiration to be available to the seeking individual.

A good reason to why seeking the advice of others is beneficial is that asking others can help give multiple viewpoints on a situation. Looking for advice in more than one person drives the seeker to open their mind and changes their own opinions. Generic_Name was facing a problem at school with her classmates. She didn't know what to do about another girl who was bullying her. She decided to confide in her mother, a friend, and a counselor for advice. Her mother had experience in this from her years as a student, and she gave her opinion to Generic_Name to talk to the bully. Her friend said that the bully was really just hurt and lonely and took it out on Generic_Name. When Generic_Name talked to the counselor, he had extensive knowledge in this area and was able to guide Generic_Name through the steps of overcoming the problems faced, and through becoming friends with her bully. By Generic_Name's seeking to find a rational choice, she found multiple viewpoints that had insight and experience in them. Furthermore, she not only was able to stop the bullying, but she was able to become friends with the girl who had once been her enemy. While receiving other viewpoints can help, those same viewpoints can lead to new thoughts and ideas that greatly enhance the ability to make a good choice.

Seeking the opinions and advice of others either inside or outside the situation fosters inspiration.

Learning from what others say is a important skill, and basing new ideas off of other ones is a complex and great way to make an informed decision. I ask my father for help on my math homework very often. When doing hard, creative thinking problems that sometimes require more knowledge than I have, my father is there to teach me. One time, I was struggling on an especially difficult problem when I asked for advice on how to complete it. My father studied the problem for nearly 20 minutes before talking. When he finally spoke, he sounded just as confused as I was. We talked through the question, rebounding ideas off of each other. We tried the strangest ways to solve the math dilemma, but to no avail. After a random thought my dad spit out, we both suddenly fell silent and let the sentence hang in the air. A light, or to be more accurate, an explosion went off in my head, and then I was scribbling as fast as I could on a piece of paper.

""You're a genius, dad! If we do this and take that..."" My mouth could not catch up to the inspiration that had lit my brain on fire. I was finally able to finish the math problem using my own way that was based off of my father's idea,

Not only does asking for help allow ideas from others to inspire your own thoughts and solutions, it brings people together.

The last explanation to why multiple advice is essential is that opinions draws others to the individual asking and creates bonds of trust. When advice is given and taken, the two people participating in the transaction now have a bond of help. Also, when asking for advice about something that needs more executive, outside, professional help, it's more likely to be gotten when you open up to others and seek those opinions. A problem that no one knows about cannot be aided if the person in need never asks for help. I have a close friend who was recently struggling with something. Generic_Name was experiencing deep bouts of depression and was scared and unsure of what to do with his feelings. He came to me and another friend, Generic_Name, seeking our opinions. We were very grateful that he had decided to tell us about his feelings, and we told him that he would need professional help, like that from a counselor, therapist, or doctor. After supporting him in telling a school counselor, he was able to begin therapy and start on the track of getting better. Ever since he came to us with the trust to ask for our advice, we have been closer than ever. Our bond as friends has been strengthened when caring for him. We immediately came to his aid when he asked, and finally brought him to outside help. With the bonds created by advice asking and giving, anyone can overcome a difficult obstacle.

When facing a situation that needs a solution or some kind of action from an individual, that individual should almost always look to others for more viewpoints, inspiration, and support. There is always a way to gain wisdom and help from others, and using that wisdom and aid to make the best choice available is beneficial to them and those around them.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
4A81C9528150,"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because different views can open your eyes to a problem. If you're having a fight with your friend, multiple opinions will help because you can see the argument from their point and try to understand what they are feeling. Multiple opinions can also help you make a strong decision based on if you agree or disagree with what the opinions say.

I was in a horrible argument with one of my friends. When we were fighting I searched for multiple opinions and it helped me make the right decision. After I talked to my mom and dad about what was happening they helped me realize that the girl was never a good friend to me and that I deserve a real friend.

Different views help with more than just arguments; they can help with forming your own opinion too. Last year I took civics class and I didn't fully have an opinion formed on politics. I started watching the news and political debates and I formed my own opinions on current issues. If I had only watched one news program or only listened to one person's campaign then I wouldn't have known that there was a different way to see things and I would have never formed a good opinion.

Whenever seeking advise you should always look for a variety opinions because someone could be wiser and already have lived through what you're going through. My mom has always been there for me whenever I need help and I hope that I can be there for her when she needs multiple opinions. She has always been very wise beyond her years and I love her for it because she helps me so much everyday.

Talking about problems with many people will help you learn multiple views on the matter at hand. It is important to remember your own opinion but also listen to others so you can form a wiser opinion. When making life changing decisions you have to remember to ask for help and truly listen to what they are saying because and outside voice could help you see the bigger picture.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

They can also see if the person they have asked have almost the same advice as the other person and do what they told them to do.

Also people like talk to more than one person because they want to hear what they think. If they see that the opinions that everyone is giving them are similar, they are most likely to make the choice they have heard. People also make a better choice by doing what they hear the most. This way they know what do to because they heard different opinions from different people.

When people also ask for advice they sometimes only talk to only one person. They talk to only one person for advice because they might not trust other people.

9D29B2E438C8,"When was the last time you asked for advice? When in such a situation, it is important to ask more than one person. If you just went to one person, you could end up getting really bad advice. Asking lots of people will allow you to evaluate multiple opinions. It also gives you control over the decision you are making, as you ultimately decide which of the options to choose. You can also come up with your own solution based off of the solutions of others. Asking multiple people allows for the freedom of choice and, consequently, a better choice.

However, when only asking one person, you may end up with bad advice. For example, when I was little, I asked my older brother for help on my homework. I assumed that since he had been through the class, he knew exactly what he was doing. Instead, he had forgotten how to do it, and mislead me. If I had asked my mom and dad, then I would have been able to reason that if they both got the same answer, they were right. My trust in one person's advice led me to get a C on my homework, and a break in my otherwise straight As.

Though only asking one person can lead to bad advice, there are times when the advice given is good. This is especially true if you ask someone you can trust. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the advice given still may not be the best, and to get the best advice possible, you will have to consult multiple people. Currently, I am scheduling classes for high school, and have talked with my mom about it. She has helped me arrange things so that I can meet all the requirements while still taking the classes I want to take. While I trust her and know that the advice she has given me is good, I plan on visiting the school counselor to make sure that everything works, and to get more advice. I know the school counselor will have better advice because she knows the most about planning for high school. It is crucial that I listen to her if I want the best advice.

Using these methods will usually get you good advice, but it requires blind trust in someone else's advice to get you precisely what you want. Good advice should make you think about what you want to do instead of telling you how to do it. By evaluating the advice given to you, you can find the parts that make the most sense to you and formulate your own idea based on them. When I finalize my plan for high school, I will use both my mom's advice, the counselor's advice, and my own idea of what I want to do to create the best plan. Using other people's advice in conjunction with mine will give me a plan that helps me accomplish exactly what I want.

There are many ways to find and use advice. No matter how you do it, the end result should reflect your wants and needs. Asking many people is the best way of doing this, because it allows you to choose what you know is best for you, and not just what one person may think. This leads to independent decisions that put you on a path to becoming the person that you want to be. Clearly, when looking for advice, consulting many people is an important start.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
E774D4694AFA,"People may think that they know everything, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Great kings and queens have fallen and been dethroned not by their people, but by themselves. They let power go to their head and stop asking advisers and mentors. People must never get overconfident. You should always ask multiple people for advise before making a decision because you get different points of view.

People have different opinions and views. People seek advise when they are confused and maybe even scared. These pieces of advice can change peoples decisions and thoughts. You can easily be over influenced by one persons opinion. Viewing a problem from multiple angles help you get a clear and easy answer.

If you were to buy a car, and you knew nothing about cars, who would you ask? Most people ask their parents and friends. You can get many outlooks from those people, but you still need a opinion for yourself, so you might research cars and prices. I think you should always have your own thoughts before going to others for help, so you don't get set in one view.

I have done things that were not smart in the sense that I didn't talk to anyone. People say you should only trust yourself, but people are not perfect and they have flaws. People buy things they don't need and won't use. I am guilty of this myself, so I can give no judgment. I know from experience that you need to put a lot of thought into choices even if they seem non important.

You should always ask multiple people for advise before making decision because you get different points of view. I have listed countless reasons and examples of why you should seek as much advise as possible before coming to a decision. It is still your choice, but I just gave you a little advise to help you succeed and not get taken advantage of in the future.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
D58A10234F6A,"Say there is a big test coming up that affects your entire future and you want to know the best way to prepare for it. Your sister tells you to not do anything about it, saying you will pass anyway, your mother tells you to study the entire night before with little sleep so you have it all crammed in your mind, and your father says to study, get good sleep, eat a healthy breakfast, and believe in yourself. You take your fathers advice and ace the test. But if you didn't get multiple people to give you advice, you would be stuck with your sisters, which really isn't the best guidance ever. I believe seeking multiple opinions on the matter you would like advice on is important because you can hear from other experiences, you can hear from wiser people, and you can compare and find an in-between if you don't like any of the advice you received.

First off, if you ask multiple people for advice, you will receive some from people with different experiences. If you ask for advice on how to fly a plane, asking a pilot with experience would result in a better answer than someone that has never even gone to the airport. The same thing goes for passions and hobbies. They will have enough experience to help you get quality advice. So asking multiple people for advice to get someone with experience is important.

Another point I'd like to make is that some people may be wiser or more well-educated than others. It may come off as rude, but its a good point. Asking a toddler for a good book to read would have a much different outcome than asking your grandfather. This kind of ties in with my ""experience"" point as well, as younger or less wise people may also have less experience. Asking multiple people for advice to get an educated person is also important.

Lastly, what if you do not like any of the advice you received? Well, with multiple points to work off of, you can find a compromise for yourself. This also works if you like all of the advice you've gotten. If you don't like any or if you want it all, you can compare all of the advice you've been told and do the best thing for you. So yes, getting multiple views can help by getting ideas to work off of.

In conclusion, seeking and receiving multiple opinions and advice can be, and is, very important. It is important to find someone with experience. It is important to find someone with wisdom. It is very important to compare answers you've gotten to see which one you like best, or create your own depending on what you like from the advice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
C646479A45F3,"Sometimes when your in a situation and you need help or just need to talk to someone about it, your basically asking for advice. If you find someone who can give you knowledge on that topic it can really help you now and in the long run. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Going to get advice from someone can help you get different views. If you are talking to your mom about the situation, she'll probably tend to be in the middle or on both side's. That's probably because she want's you to see the other side of things too. Seeing the other side of things can change your perspective and lead you to see more than what you saw before.

The Washington Post says ""2 out of every 3 people end up sticking with the advice their friends, family, teachers give them about the other side. This is because it changes their view of things and makes them realize different things."" Seeking for advice can really change the way you look at things and make you see clearer on one side than the other. You might hear one persons advice and think about the other side of things and what could happen if this.... if that... happens. If you go to 2 or more people it can make your decision easier to make.

If you go to someone who has been through something like it or who has needed the same kind of advice once before, they can share with you wiser advice. Sometimes when your really not sure what to do and you've already gone to a couple of people, find someone who has been through something like it before. Since they've been through it they can tell you why they came to the decision they made. This may help you with the decision making process. Going to a family member, friend, teacher, or coach that's been through it might steer you into a different direction then you may have hoped for, but they can definitely show you where they're coming from.

New York Times explains, ""74% of young adults who go to seek advice from someone who has been through the situation says it helps them see why they chose what they went with. Even though this may not work for all situations, it can certainly help in some ways, even if it's not huge."" This is a way of telling yourself that even if you didn't go with that persons advice, at least you saw it through and got a better look at all of the options closely.

Different ways of handling the situation is big. You could go one or another, but your just not sure.

The Generic_City Newspaper says ""A way to help you decide what to do in a situation is to ask each person you go for different advice. For example ask each person a different question and this way you get different answers, in which gives you different ways to handle the situation."" There can be many different options and sometimes it can be overwhelming, but if you limit how many people you ask and ask them each a different question, than you can focus on those answers instead of a bunch of overloading advice. If you ask 2 or 3 people for advice it will make it easier on you, but of course don't just ask one person because it helps to know all the different opinions.

In the end, I think it is really important that when you are seeking advice, to go to at least more than 2 different people. Even if two of those people give you basically the same answer, at least you went to them because you might not need their advice now, but in the long run their advice could really help. Getting advice from multiple people can help you make a better choice because they could have a totally different point/opinion and they could really help you see all the other options than just yours. They can also help you to see the other side of things and maybe even make you agree with that side, which could change your whole perspective of things. It's really helpful to seek advice from your peers, but I think it's even more helpful to go to more than one person. To see all of your options. You should always go for what you think the right choice is, even if your best friend gave you completely different advice. Next time you need advice, would you go to someone who can help you make a better choice, or would you go to someone who can give you the advice you're really looking for?                ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
2AAE43DCEAAE,"You ever buy something you want as soon as you see it and you regret it later. While to many people impulse buying is fun. Compared to others who ask for others help on a decision so they dont regret it. when people ask for help they get more than one point of view on their decision to make. Also they have that information that others brought up, so the next time they are buying something similar they can think back to that.

I had this old bike where my knees touched the handle bars and the seat would move around on. When I was saving for a new bike I wanted a nice one I saved for a year and a half. I had all that time to ask my parents as well as my friends if a new bike would be a good idea. They convinced me that a new bike would be a good option and i'm happy with it. In other words listening to others may help you get to a decision you were unsure with.

Another reason is in the future when you are saving for another thing . You can use your prior knowledge to help sway your decision. On whether to buy the thing you want or not. I personally used this on my trip in new York when I was buying a gift for my brother. So using prior knowledge form others can help you get to a decision.

Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions really is a foundation to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it.

In the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success. Next, advice from others can make you more wiser when you make your own choices, if

Abraham

Lincoln never saw how African Americans were treated for there skin color he would have never signed the documents for slavery to be band. if he never got advice he mostly likely would have never Andres the problems with having that toxic racism. If it wasnt for him, it would still be here today thanks to out 16th President, which boils down to good thinking and advice. At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel, father, and mother. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that. Only instead its intellects make the right choice to help you.

In Conclusion, advice is there to help you, opinions are there to guide you to something that gives you smarts to making the right choices in the world we live in live, sure not all opinions hear might not be in your favor.

""Hey there,"" Someone yelled then you relize thats the call of friend that is about to ask for some advice. Many people take advice from others to help with problems they think they can't do by them self. Which leads to the question why take advice from others? They take advice because they don't neccarly need help, but want help to take the easy way out of things. By doing this they second guss them selfs and go and ask more people for more advise to see if the other person advice was wrong, or they have no idea what to do. If that's the case then they take the advice of others to help them with his/her problem by taking the best advice possible, asking how to do what you don't, and knowledge.

Firstly, by taking the best possible advice you would want to go to multiple people for there advice, experince, and help. By going to someone who has already given advice to others they will probably have a lot of imformation for you to have about your issue. If you go to someone with a ton of experince there advice would probaly be the best. Lastly if you go to someone with the experince you have you could give advice to each other, making it good for both of you.

Next, you could ask for tips or pointers on how to give advice to others, learning, and on how to take action. Asking for advice to give other people advice is a great idea if you want to help others out and yourself. By learning you could gain experince like Mrs. Generic_Name to advice to others. Lastly by taking action you take the advice you gain and give it to others.

Finaly, by going to multiple people you gain more knowledge including their perspectives, there reasons on what they would do, and how they would resolve the matter. First by knowing someones perspective you will know on how they would do stuff their own way. Second the reasons on why they would do what they are going to do will help with your actions by putting other reasons together. Lastly by knowing how they would solve the issue it would help to take others solutions all in all.

In conclusion, people who ask others for help are wanting the best advice possible, asking for tips they don't know how to do themselfs, and knowledge. Those who take advice will likely feel better when they actually use the advice to solve there problem and will enjoy it. So don't be afraid to ask for advice from others it will benifit you in the long run.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
94C41739F214,"Seeking multiple opinions can help people make better choices. Talking to more people can boost your understanding of something, help see different points of view, and can boost your trust in someone. When I was in 6th grade I had to write a essay on WWII. I didnt know much so I started asking people about WWII. I found lots of good information from my Grandpa but it wasn't complete, so I went to my dad and he helped fill in the gaps and gave me a second opinion on my topic. Then instead of only writing about the one opinion I chose the better idea and wrote about both, giving may paper more detail.

Seeking multiple opinions can help boost someones understanding of something. One person can only hold so much information, so by getting many opinions you can understand things better because your getting more information. People may know more about a topic than someone else, but by only going to one person they may not give you the information you need and wont help your understanding of that topic. Someone may give you a portion of the information you need, but by getting more you can build them on top of each other to make a better choice. The more and more you hear new opinions the better it can boost you knowledge of that topic.

People have different views on a topic and may know more about one side of an argument than the other. Hearing both sides of an argument can help you write a more in depth essay and a more meaningful one to people on one side of an argument . You can reach out to people because you know why they support or dislike something and try to persuade them to your opinion. By hearing different sides of an argument you can make a better choice because you know both argument and will choose the better one that will help you more.

When you hear many opinions on something it can boost your trust and respect for someone. When you hear the same opinions from different people you can start to trust what they say. When you find out what they say is true then it may build your confidence in them and you may go back to them in the future because you know they have some good knowledge. When you hear the same opinion from a different person it can start to boost your trust in it. When you ask more people for their opinion on the topic and they say the same thing that others have already said. Then you will probably trust that opinion and have more confidence in your choices because you know people agree with you.

Seeking more opinions can help people get advice and use that advice to make a smart choice. When you know more about a topic and understand it you are expected to do the right thing because you know about it. When you hear different sides of an argument you can make a better choice in life because you've not been pushed by one side of an argument, so your not bias. This can help you make a choice that will benefit you because you know the pros of both arguments. Someone will probably make the better choice because they trust all the good information their getting from people. No one says good things about a terrible choice. These are just some of the reasons why seeking multiple opinions from people can help someone make a better choice.    ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8
87958B77E2DC,"Have you ever asked someone for advice but still not been sure about your decision? If so you should have tried asking more people. Asking multiple people for advice is a great way to see different sides of an argument. Three reasons to ask for multiple opinions are different views, not a biased outcome and, better reasoning for the final verdict.

The first reason that it is good to get multiple opinions is different views is because people may see the same problem but get a different answer. This then allows you to get more idea of the outcome of the solution that you may not have seen before. It is also good to get different opinions because you may get different views and you still don't have a set answer, you can decide based on the number of people who voted each way.

The second reason is that it is good to get a non-biased answer is so that you don't miss an opportunity because you asked one person who dislikes something that you wanted to do. When you get multiple opinions you set yourself up to get a non-biased opinion so that you are not unfair to one side of an argument. A non-biased opinion is extremely important when it comes to a big decision that could hurt you later on in life so it just a good idea to make sure you see both sides of an argument.

The final reason is that you get a better final decision out of it. The reason for this is because you are putting in more time by asking more people that you really get to think about the problem at hand. This helps because sometimes people end up ruining themselves by rushing headfirst into something without thinking about the consequences that the decision may have. The reason you are asking multiple people in the first place is so that you can get a better final verdict on the topic so you know you aren't making a mistake by doing something.

Three reasons that getting multiple opinions is a good thing are different views, a non-biased answer and, a better final verdict. Which is why I believe that getting multiple opinions is the smart thing to do.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
9D1FEBF9237B,"Have you ever had to make a tough decision before? Most of us have, and the first thing we do is ask for advice. Most of the time it is good to ask multiple people advice and try to get multiple opinions. There are multiple reasons why it is good to get multiple opinions, but the two main reasons are that it reduces bias and it makes the advice more reliable.

Getting multiple opinions helps reduce bias. Bias is a person's opinion towards a certain subject, and it is something we generally try to avoid. Getting multiple opinions can help reduce bias, because when you get multiple opinions you are introduced to new perspectives. Getting multiple perspectives is useful, because it allows you to think about something in multiple different ways and you are more likely to succeed. Another reason it is good to get multiple perspectives is that not everyone agrees with you, so you might receive constructive criticism. Constructive criticism helps improve your ideas and is essential when you are making a tough decision.

Another benefit of getting multiple opinions is that it makes your advice more reliable. This isn't always true, but most of the time, if lot's of people agree with something, it is probably true. One example of this was when I needed help on my homework. One time I was working on an essay for English and I was trying to decide if I needed to put a space between my sentences. First, I asked my mom to see what she thought. Then, I asked my dad to see what he thought. Asking my mom was probably enough but I wanted to make sure everyone agreed with the advice before I used it. I actually got an ""A"" on the essay, so I think the advice worked.

In conclusion, getting multiple opinions is useful when you are trying to get advice. Getting multiple opinions introduces you to new perspectives that are helpful when trying to decide what to do. Getting multiple opinions also makes the advice more reliable, because if more than one person agrees with it, it is more likely to be right. It is probably possible to get good advice with only one opinion, but getting more than one opinion has so many benefits there is no reason not to.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
47228B569E22,"Would you ask more then one person for advice ? If so why would you ? Because on my opinion I think that it would be good to ask other people for their advice on something , because some people could give you different advice , they can help you pick rather or not you should do something , and also you can see who are the people that are willing to help you with some good advice.

Now I would like to talk about why it would be good to get advice from multiple people. I think it is good because I have had a moment when I did not know if I should still be friends with someone I knew had talked behind my back so I started to ask some friend and family members to see what they think about it . Now know they where completely honest with me , so one of my family members told me if what she said hurt me in any type of way then to just stop talking to her. So then I kept asking and they kept giving me different advice , so what I did was I put everything together and it all added up in a way so that is how I got my answer to what I should do. That is why it is good to ask different people for advice because some could give you the same advice and some wont . Now some advice can be good but some are not always good. And it is good to get advice because when you are about to do something you wont have to worry that you are going to do something bad because if the person that you talked to gave you good advice you dont have to worry.

Why is it good to know other peoples opinion? Let me tell you why it is good to know , because if you tell them something then of course they will stop and think then be like you should not do that because you could hurt your self , nor you can hurt the other person. Because then they would tell you why it is a good idea and why it is not. I have been in a situation like that as well where I wanted to do something so i just wanted to make sure that what I was about to do would not hurt any one in any type of way so my cousin started to give me reasons to why I should not do it . I ended up listening to her but then I realized that if I never asked her if it was a good idea I would have made a huge mistake. And that is what I want you to notice that if you are about to do somewhere rather it is to your self or someone else try talking to someone ,and ask them for advice because really it could help. And they can all make sure that you and everyone else are okay. So really knowing other peoples opinion really just a good choice to make because it is helping you.

Now this one is my favorite. Witch is that asking for advice lets you see who are the true friends that are acutely willing to give you advice , and good advice not bad . Because people always have that one friend that is willing to help but not help you in a good way more like in a bad way , because most times let me start of small you ask them a question "" oh does this one look good on me or that one"" and they will answer back with the one they think looks ugly and you know they are picking the ugly one but you just pick not to say anything. Now let me go big if you ask them for advice on something serious they will tell you oh yeah you should do it because it wont harm anyone , but no they just want to put lies in your head so that when people with actual good advice come you will be confused and not know what to do. So it is better to know when a friend is just lying to you because you want a friend that tells you the truth and that you can trust with really anything and you know that their advice wont be bad. Also when you ask any one in particular for advice know that people are not always right so every time you need to make a decision and need advice go with what your head tells you to not always with what other people tell you .

So really that is what I think could help people notice that asking different people for advice is really help full because when you get different ideas from multiple people you have a lot of choices and you get to pick the best one out of all the choices you got but of course you would know rather or not what they told you was good and helpful because if it was not then obviously do not use it. But really my point here is if you ask more then one person for help it can really help you out , because imagine you where going to do something and a part of you is saying dont do it but the other part of you is saying you should do it . Then of course you will need someone to give you advice to what you should do because if it was something bad then that would not be good . So really it is best to just ask someone for their opinion. Because it is always better to do something when someone tells you that it is okay then always doing things by yourself and end up ruining something. So real question here is would you ever ask for someone else opinion? ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

Asking only one person for an opinion is not really a bad thing, but that person you're asking might not tell you everything you need to know. Looking for multiple opinions rather than one is better because some people know more then others and you get more information to base your choice off of.

When you're asking somebody for their opinion it's better to ask multiple people because some know more then others. There are some people that will give you a basic four word response because they don't know anything about what you're asking them about. However others have more knowledge or experience. Those people will give you a long response to your question with more information and advice about the choice you're going to make. An example would be buying something and you didn't know if you are getting your money's worth. You could ask different people to see if you're getting a good deal or if you could buy something for the same quality for a lower price somewhere else.

Getting multiple opinions also gives you more information to base your choice off of. If you have more information it will make it easier for you to choose, or it will give you alot more options to choose from. You could put together all the information you got from asking multiple people to help make a better choice for yourself. This relates to me because it helped me pick out a dog when I was younger. It made it easier for me to choose a dog that would be perfect for my lifestyle.

When found in a situation, many people ask others for their advice during the situation to very the outcome. If you ask more than one person for their advise or opinion on how to handle something, you will get multiple different answers. That should make the situation easier to handle, because you can see how it might end if you choose a certain way to deal with it.

You could us that advice to see if that would be a great idea for your choice on your situation . With how you want to execute that problem and or situation you might have . We all would like the best awnser so we could chose the best way to make a choice on whatever you are doing.

Then your friend said the other game was better. You could ask another friend on their thought. Then ask with is game is better in your oppion. Then you could go off what he said beaches you got more advice on that game you chould purchase .

DD1D41CC5388,"The other day I asked my mother for advice about boys. I think that I am coming-of-age, and I want to know how to get a guy's attention. I asked my mother, ""How can I get guys to notice me?"" My mother looked at me puzzled for a few minutes. Later, she responds with, ""Honey, all you have to do is flirt!"" Little did she know, flirting was not in my vocabulary. Soon after, my sister comes into the room, from eavesdropping, and says, ""That's not true, mom! You need to listen to me, sister. All you have to do is be yourself. If a guy doesn't like you for who you are, then they aren't worth your time."" All of a sudden my grandma, who hasn't been out on a date for a while, says, ""Darling, don't listen to them. What you have to do is act dumb. Guys will be chasing your tail if you do that."" Everyone started to bicker back and forth for a while. After gathering all of the advice I got, I started thinking,

""I know what to do!""

Personally, I think getting advice from more than one person has better outcomes. I think it's because with multiple opinions you have more options to choose from, someone may have trouble answering your question, and you may end up finding someone who has more knowledge about your question.

One reason people should seek for advice from more than one person is you have more options to choose from. When I asked my mom for advice, she gave me an answer I wasn't quite comfortable doing. Also, if it wasn't my sister and grandma, I would have been stuck flirting, which is uncomfortable for me. At the end of the day, I had a lot of opinions from different people, and it was my choice to choose the one I feel is better for me. If you don't feel comfortable with an answer, then ask someone else. Doing so, you may be able to get a different outcome. Also, the person you originally asked may have trouble giving you the right answer.

Another reason is the person you originally asked may have trouble giving you the right answer. When I asked my mom for help, she looked at me with a confused face and paused for a long time. I think it was because she never thought of me asking that question before. As a result, she couldn't think of an answer on the spot. She still gave me good advice, but it did seem as if she had trouble answering me. If you ever have someone who can't give you an answer easily, the best choice is to ask someone else. They may have the abilities to give you a well thought out answer. Lastly, another person may have more knowledge about the subject, so they may be able to help you more efficiently.

The last reason is someone may have more experience with the subject you are wanting help with. For example, my sister is in college, and she is taking a social development class. Believe it or not, she learned about the difficulties of confrontation with the opposite gender. In that class, she learned about what not to do when you are talking to a male or female. Which means she knows a lot more about my question then my grandma. My grandma hasn't been out on a date in forty-five years. As a result, she isn't the best person to give advice about talking to boys. In the end, if you want a good answer to a question you have, you should go to multiple people who can help you.

In conclusion, getting advice from more than one person has its rewards. My reasoning is because you have more options to choose from, one person may trouble answering your question, and another person may have more knowledge about your question. Ask someone who has more experience with what you want to know. Also, go to someone you trust, and someone who will give you factual information. ""The right people will be with you to help you answer all of your questions."" ~Unknown",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
B2305853B773,"Often times it is hard to make decisions. Looking at all the options in different ways is an effective way to assess what the right choice is, but at times it's difficult to make those decisions alone. It's best to get the most advice possible, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. People's advisory can influence someone to make the best possible decision and recieving feedback from more than one person is critical to this process. When seeking advice, talking to more than one person helps you know what all the options are.

The best possible choice may not even be the one that benefits you the most. People tend to do things that benefit them the most instead of knowing how there decisions can affect others. When others give you advice, they are expressing their viewpoints. When making a deicision, people usually don't think how it might affect others, what is usually pondered is how they will be affected, but it's essentail that you know others viewpoints. In order to make a good decision, you need to know what the options are. When asking multiple people what their opinion is, they will give you an option. Asking multiple people for advice will give you a number of different options and knowing all the options will make it easier for you to make the right decision. Finding the best option that gives the most benefits without harming anyone will be easy to find because you can compare all the options given by your friends, family, teacher, etc. Asking a lot of people for advice will give you a variety of decisions to choose from, yet not everyone's advice can be equally considered as others. It's important to ask the right people for advice.

Some advisors may be more credible than others. It's good to get the opinions from multiple people, but it's also very important that you take in account the people you are asking. The advice from a friend will most likely not be as dependable as the advice from an adult. An adult will better proccess the information and are more matured than kids. In addition, one of the people that is giving you advice might be bias. This is why it's good to ask multiple people because one person may be giving you advice to somehow benefit them, or benefit something or someone they like. What if your mom said that if you didn't pass a class you would be grounded. You had a final test that determines your grade for the marking period. You didn't study enough for the test and your friends sees you studying during lunch. He asks you why you are studying and you explain to him that if you don't pass the test you will not have a passing grade and you will be grounded. You and your friend were going to have a sleepover that weekend. Your friend says to copy his answers on the test so you can pass. This example shows how credibility is very critical in the person that's giving you advice. The friend is biased and is giving you bad advice in order for you to have a sleepover with him, which he would benefit from. Having a lot of opinions that agrees with you gives you support.

People ask multiple people for advice because they need clarification. Even if someone thinks that they are doing the right thing, it's human nature to ask others what they think. Having someone else agree with you will strengthen your confidence and will make you certain that you are right. People will ask muliple people

""Is this the right thing to do?""

and ""You would do the same, right?"" to make sure that they know that what they are doing is correct. For these reasons, people get as many opinions as they can so they can make the best decision.

It's always best to ask multiple people for advice because it will help you know what all the options are, some people's advice may be more credible and better than others, some opinions may not be based on the situation, but may be because that person has a bias, etc. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Most people are not great at making difficult decisions, but recieving advice can help you analyze the situation and choose the best possible option. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

2ACB43DD4A24,"Seeking advice from multiple people will give you a sense of what other people think about the topic. Seeking answers from multiple people will give you more of an understanding about what is going on and what you should decide to do in order to produce a better outcome for you and for others. In order to make the right decision you need to be aware of how the majority of the people you ask view the topic. Asking questions about problems is how you become smarter. If nobody were to ask questions, nobody would be smart, and we would all still be living in caves. In order to gain knowledge we need to understand how things function in our world. We need to know what to do and what not to do.

There are many possible outcomes that could lead to bad things if you don't ask others' point of view on the topic. For example, a classmate named Generic_Name and I are having problems between ourselves. I do not know whether to apologize or to let the freindship die off. I ask ten people in my class about their opinion on Generic_Name. Nine out of the ten people think that Generic_Name has a very self loathing and snippy personality. They also say that he often does not care about his friends and only does things that please himself.

Because I asked my fellow classmates, I now have a sense of Generic_Name's personality traits. The majority of my classmates did not like Generic_Name very much. Mrs. Generic_Name, my math teacher, often gets mad at Generic_Name and sends him home with misbehavior notes for his parents to read. I now know that Generic_Name is not a very nice person and is prone to getting into trouble. Based on what I have heard from others and what I have learned in class about Generic_Name, I have come to the conclusion that it would not be a wise decision to become friends with Generic_Name again. Becoming friends with Generic_Name would set me up for failure. I would fall under the influence of Generic_Name and most likely get myself into trouble.

Asking multiple people's opinions can also be a great stradegy for the work environment. Getting advice from others at work can lead to multiple benefits. For example, I am working on a presentation for a new product, I ask my bosses whether or not they think it would be a good idea to implement a free fifty day trial. Eighty percent of my bosses deem it necessary to include a free fifty day trial. In the longrun, it would help push the customers to buy our product becuase they know they can always return it before the fifty days is up. As a result, on the day that the product was released to the public, we made thirty percent more sales than we had previously thought due to the fifty day free trial. That very same day my boss decided to give me a fifteen percent pay raise for my idea of implementing the fifty day free trial.

In conclusion, you will always arrive at the best decision if you ask multiple people's opinions. The best way to understand how the world works is to ask questions. Without questions we would still be living in caves with no electricity and wearing no clothes. ""Two heads are always better than one"", said the great Albert Einstein. Asking multiple opinions will produce a better outcome than just using you're knowledge on the subject. There is only one way to put this, it is a complete mistake for someone to go into something blind, you need to know your surroundings, it just so happens that the only way to avoid going into something blind, is asking people their opinions.                                      ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

Advice

When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

I think that people do this because, when someone is asking other people for advice, they are hearing different opinions on how to handle the situation.

Some people might do this so hear more than one side of a story or hear different ways to do something.

I do this to see what my choices are.

The more people I ask, the more choices I get.

I used to think that if I'd ask one person for advice, then that was it because I thought it was good advice.

Sometimes it works when you ask one person for advice, but you need to ask more than one person to get good advice because two heads are better than one.

The more people you ask the smarter or dumber some advice sounds.

Some of the reasons that people ask others for advice are, to narrow down their choices to pick the best one.

If they narrow their choices down to pick the best one, they have a couple to work with and will probably end up having good advice.

The first person you ask could have not great advice or didn't quite give you what you where looking for.

The people that you ask could have the same advice as you.

All of these are reasons to ask more than one person for their opinion.

The whole goal of asking other people opinions is to see which will most effectively work.

I understand the fact that the first person's advice is good but, you need to ask other people to see if it is good advice or bad.

Some people that give out really good advice are your parents or grandparents.

They have usually gone through what you are going through and know the right type of advice to give out. Teachers and counselors also give out good advice towards school.

Therapists almost always have good advice because they are paid too.

If you are going to ask more than one person for advice, make sure they are someone you can trust.

I believe that it is smart ask more than one person for their advice because you could hear one that they have not heard before.

If it is advice you have not heard before, then it could let you have a wider collection.

Some people might have the same advice or opinions therefore making it the most effective because it is the most common and used by most people. For me, the two most reliable people for good advice is my parents.

The best choice you can make from others advice should benefit you.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
5B57A518AE8B,"How does someone make a better choice when seeking multiple opinions from others?

Have you ever hesitated about a decision and asked others what they believe you should choose? When you ask someone about what choice you should make they often share their experiences on that topic giving you more knowledge on each choice. Talking to more than one person can help someone make better decisions by knowing other peoples experiences. Being aware of the possible outcomes, knowing what the experience is like, and knowing how it will affect others are all reasons why it is important to know other people's experiences when asking for their opinion.

When a person seeks advice from multiple people that have had experiences with their choice, the person is more likely to be more aware of what the possible outcomes are. For example, when I was choosing my electives for eighth grade, I couldn't decide whether to retake Algebra I or take Geometry. Therefore, I asked my sister, Generic_Name, who had retaken Algebra I, and my brother, Generic_Name, who had taken Geometry. Generic_Name's opinion was that because my grade Algebra 1 in was not good, it'd be wiser to retake it because the eighth grade Algebra I teachers taught better than the seventh grade teachers. She also mentioned that retaking it was a chance to get my grades higher. Generic_Name, however, told me that Geometry was easy and it could give me more high school credits. I chose to retake Algebra I, as a result, I have a perfect score in the class and I was able to learn more than I did in seventh grade. My peers that have taken Geometry say that the class is hard and they don't have a good grade in it. When I asked my siblings what it was like taking each class in eighth grade, they shared with me their experiences which lead me to make right choice by taking Algebra I which had a better outcome.

When people share their experiences with another person, that person knows that they could expirience the same thing. For example, when buying a product a person will want to know if it is worth the money. The person will most likely go to the reviews of the product and see how other described the quality. Reading the reviews helps someone decide whether they should buy the product based on how well it works and lasts. Another scenario is when people want to travel and don't know if the place they are traveling to is going to be how they think it is. People often go to friends or family that they know have traveled to that destination to know what they should expect when they arrive. Another time when somone will want to know other peoples experiences is when they want to eat at a restaurant. People will ask others for reccomendations for restaurants that they beleive they would enjoy and which restaurants they don't reccomend eating at. Some restaurants have unsanitary foods or have foods that can cause severe allergic reactions, to stay safe people want to learn from other peoples experiences to learn if they had any problems with certain restaurants so they know which places they should eat at. Knowing other people's experiences with things someone wants to try out is important so they know what they could be experiencing when they make a certain choice.

Sometimes making a decision affects not just one person, but multiple people. An example would be when a leader is making a rule they're going to want to know what happened when other countries tried to enforce the same rule. They want to know how the rule affected the citizens of other countries to know if the new rule would be beneficial or harmful for their people. Another time when this happens is when family or friends want to do an activity, they communicate with each other and share which activities they have done in the past that they think everyone else will enjoy. During sports games the players on a team will strategize with each other to find the best way to win. They know which tactics work and which don't after trying out new strategies each game and seeing if strategies that other teams used have worked. Sometimes making a decision doesn't depend on one person, it depends on multiple people to end up with a choice together so everyone is in agreement and everything is fair. These are all reasons why it is important to know others people's experiences and opinions when making a choice.

When a person is asked about their opinion on a certain choice they often share their experiences with it which helps the person asking make a better choice. Asking for others opinions helps the person be more aware of the possible outcomes, know what the experience will be like, and know how it will affect others. Making huge decisions is hard, but when a person makes them alone without anybody elses opinion, it is even harder.        ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0

Generic_Name get's back on the phone with his dad he says, ""They said only twenty percent,"" Generic_Name's dad says ""What the heck, let her try to fight it out."" When asking people for advice, they sometimes talk to more then one person, because they have a difficult choice to make, they need a new prospective, and they are bad decision makers.

A lot of time's people have a really hard decision to make and need people's advice. This is something millions of people experience every day. An example of this is when us eighth graders had to make choices about what we did or didn't want to have in our schedules, when picking out our schedules. I'm sure that we all got advice via teachers, parents, or older sibling, we all had tough decisions to make that would effect our future. Know think of Spiderman Homecoming, a movie that came out a few years ago. Peter Parker, aka Spiderman, had the decision at the end of the movie to become an Avenger, but Peter Parker learning from his experiences and what others told him decided that they are right and he is to young to become an Avenger, so Peter politely declined. Know you might say what if the people helping you make these tough decisions tell you to do something stupid? What is say to that is that you just have to have some common sense so that stupid people don't ruin your life and use the advice of other people.

Most people only think one way and have a hard time finding another solution, because they can only think of their solution, that is why it is important to get other people's prospective. As you are playing soccer with your buddy's one of your friend's pull's a muscle and you incest that you call an ambulance. Your other friend's are not thinking like you, and tell him to rest and drink water because its not that serious. In that incest you would have wasted a tone of money and wasted an ambulances time by making it come checkout your friend, that would have happened if you didn't have your other friend's who had a different prospective then you. Know by now you have probably watched Avenger's Endgame and in that movie everyone had a different prospective. Ironman had moved on and Captain America had joined a group to talk about the people they missed, but everything changed when Antman returned and had a different prospective and had the idea to build a time machine. Know you might say what if every one in your group thinks like you and has the same prospective. What I say to that is that is impossible and even if it happened then go find someone, somewhere else who thinks differently.

People can be bad at lot's of things and one of those things is making decisions. In the episode ""Hurricane"" of the show American Dad, Stan, the dad of the family, makes bad decision after bad decision making things worse and worse. Stan makes his family stay in there house during a hurricane and then the streets flood, later Stan let's a shark into the house and even make's worse decision's later in the episode. So as you can tell Stan isn't the best decision maker and need's other people's advice. A lot of the time professional athletes make bad decisions and one of the most recent athletes to do this was Antonio Brown. He had a great job and was probably the best receiver in the NFL at the time, and then he lost it because he started making bad decisions, such as recording private locker room meeting's and tweeting very disrespectful thing's. These bad decisions ruined his career and if he just talked to someone and talked it through he might have gotten some sense knocked into him.

You know that the mail always comes at 2:30 and you saw when the mail man came and dropped it in front of your house. Then you saw two teens walking in front of your house. You might quickly regconise them and quickly call the cops but they wont get arrested on the spot. The police will have to have witnesses,and the teens

Point of View of the story

I always ask my friends what they think about something before making my final answer.

If people give you more opinions about something you will know like the pros and cons of what ever your asking about. Thats why i always ask my friends to give me there point of view in things, its easier for me to pick a choice between just by knowing whats better for me. Point of views will always help you doesnt matter what problem you have because you can literally figure an answer quickly.

dvice is something humans seek for most of their lives, and mostly because we need it a lot since us we are not perfect. We should be able to get advice from different types of people like have diversity and know the opinion of others about certain situations, or problems we have in our daily life. Seeking for multiple opinions can have a very positive effect on the people who need the advice, and honestly I do seek different perspectives all the time. There's many reasons why multiple opinions can help us in our lives to make a decision we are not exactly sure about. People usually seek for multiple opinions to get the specific answer they want but don't know if it's right, some of the people they ask advice are not so good at giving it, and sometimes they don't think they have enough information or advice. All these are reasons why people seek for more advice in more than just one person, and i'll explain why some of them can be so positive.

Most times when people look for a different opinion from the past one they got is because they're seeking a specific answer they want. When we are in a situation where we have no idea what to do,but deep down kind of know,we ask someone about their opinion on the subject and when we don't get the answer we were expecting we lose interest on knowing the rest of what they think and look somewhere else to get that answer that we want, but are not sure about. I'm one of these people to be honest because sometimes I know the answer to what I want to do about the situation I'm in, but think is wrong, so I go around asking my friends about what they think, and when most of them don't give me the answer I want or the reassurance I need about my decision I stop listening and look for another point of view that thinks the same way as I do. Unless you have experienced this you might not understand it, but sometimes people just want reassurance about what they think is the right choice, but don't want to share it because they think is wrong, so they just ask other people what they think so they can be sure the choice they make is positive. There's so many people who think alike and share the same thoughts as others, so they help each other, and looking for those extra opinions lets them find these people who they can connect with and be free to express what they think with them.

There's people who don't give the best advice out there and don't care about others, so us humans look for another person for a piece of advice. In my experience I've noticed there is many people who won't care if you ask for their advice and that's why we are required to look somewhere else. Being able to ask more people for their advice or opinion is very helpful because sometimes when the person we look up to the most to get the advice from isn't there to give it, we can go to all these other people who can help us, and give us the advice we need. When we don't get the best advice from people we also tend to go to someone else for help because the person who gave us the last advice wasn't as interested to help you, or they didn't know what to tell you. Also when we don't get the type of attention we want from someone we usually think they're not interested in us so we leave and ask somebody else, and that's when we get the good advice we were looking for and don't need more opinions or advice.

The last reason why we seek multiple people for advice or opinions is because we don't get enough information or advice from the first person we ask, so we look for more,and more. When I'm stressed about making a decision I usually ask my friends or my mom for advice, and when my friend or mom gives me the right advice, but I think I need a little bit more because we didn't talk about it much and I'm a little insecure I ask someone else so we can talk about it. People say to keep things to yourself and I mean they're right because who wants everyone all up on their business but sometimes we do need the people we trust and ask them for the advice or opinion we need and when one is not enough we go to another to get the right amount we want or need to be satisfact with ourselves. Having multiple people to talk to also gives us the opportunity to get the right amount of advice we would like. Getting enough information about the choice we will make is really important and being able to talk to more than just one person will let you get more of the information you're looking for.

These are three of the many reasons why having multiple people to get advice and opinions from is important and can have a positive effect on people. We don't always need a multiple opinions and advice, but there is times when we will need them, and it will be helpful. Everyone should help each other when we need their help because when they need it we should be able to be there for them, too. We all make mistakes and sometimes we need advice from each other to know what to do, but if people need our help we don't need to wait for something in exchange of our advice because we're all humans and need each other to be better each day. In conclusion we all need multiple opinions and advice from different people sometimes, and it could have have a positive effect on our lives, and that's why these resasons make many of us seek for those multiple advices and opinions everyday.                                         ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0
F43C812A0073,"When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to several people for different opinions. Asking for advice from different people and getting different opinions is helpful because you get different points of view on what you are asking, it may help you make a unique decision, and to reassure what you may have been thinking to begin with.

Firstly getting different points of view on what you are asking can help you because you are hearing all these different peoples answers which may make you change your mind. It may change your point of view on the way you was thinking about what you were asking for. Gives the person multiple different answers and opinions to chose from so that you can make the right choice.

Additionally reassurance is always good when asking others for advice. Reassuring may help you find someone who was thinking the same thing which is good for making decisions. Seeing if what you were thinking is relating to what others are thinking so that you can make a decision that is not crazy and does not make since. Making confident decisions is good so that you are not second guessing it and changing your mind about your decision.

Furthermore unique decision making is always helpful. Unique decisions stand out from what others may be thinking. When asking others for advice you have the ability to make your decisions the opposite of what most others are thinking so that your decision is different than all the other decisions. Showing creativity in your decision is very unique because you put all of your creative thoughts in one decision which always makes it better.

In conclusion talking to different people for there opinions can make a creative decision, give you different points of view on what you were thinking for a better decision, and gives you reassurance. All these help make better choices for your decision making, and asking others for there advice can always help with yours. So that you always are making the better and right decision.        ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
0D1493FDAAD3,"Have you ever been faced with a tough decision and not know what to do? What influenced your decision that you made the most? The answer to that question is most likely other peoplesÃÂ´ opinions. Asking them to share their experiences with the problem gave you knowledge to help you know what to do. You might not think much of them, but peoplesÃÂ´ opinions help us avoid mistakes.

Making a tough decision is much easier when there are people to tell you what mistakes they made. When you know about what they did wrong, it can help you avoid it. Say that you do not know which product to buy. Your friends all say that one product is better, because their product broke and is unusable after a short period of time. Making the decision about what to buy is no longer difficult, because you have the advice of people faced with the same decision, and when you heard about their mistake you avoided it. By asking your peers, you made a good decision.

Another reason to talk to multiple people when making a purchase is to learn from their successes. ÃÅf you saw a group of people successfully do what you are trying now, learn what they did to overcome the obstacle. If it worked for them, it will probably work for you. In the scenario above, would it make it even easier to decide if a friend said that when he bought the second product, it worked fine and he was happy with it? You would probably would have no more doubts about your once tough decision.

When asking opinions about what to do in your problem, asking multiple people can help confirm if information about your issue is true. When searching for answers, you will find false information. But if you ask multiple people, false information will be rooted out and replaced with genuine, helpful facts that will make your decision easier. Once, I was writing an editorial about the trustworthiness of online reviews, and discovered that most of them are fake. When I was finished with the editorial, my main message coming out of it was that a word of mouth recommendation is one of the most reliable sources of information. Asking multiple people about your issue will get rid of any doubts you had about your decision.

Now that you know about how multiple opinions are a valuable source of information. When asking your peers, you will find out about what mistakes were made by them, and how to avoid them. If you talk to people about how they succeeded in your position, you will know how do succeed, and you will. Asking multiple people for a word of mouth recommendation will get rid of all the fake information, and make sure you make the correct decision. Asking multiple people is the best way to avoid making the wrong decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
4918D9A545C5,"Did you know that eight out of ten people ask for help and get the right answer. Also did you know that over half of students in the world do not ask for help, therefore, they do bad in school. Today my friend and I were arguing about if its better to ask for other peopleÃÂ´s opinions or not, and he said itÃÂ´s not because asking other people for their opinions is just a waste of time. Therefore, I wrote this essay to prove him wrong. Seeking for multiple opinions can help make a better choice because it helps you think of two sides of the story, other people are smarter and more experienced, and you can tell them why they were wrong.

To begin with, it helps you see multiple sides of an argument. It can help you understand why they think that way. You could change there opinion by telling them what they got wrong. Also could change your opinion on the topic. For an example, I was on a field trip and I went to a group of friends arguing about is it good to lie or not. I thought that it was obviously not good to lie. But when they asked there guardians they quickly changed my mind by saying its good to lie to not hurt someones feelings. This is one of the reasons why I think its good to ask for other peopleÃÂ´s opinion.

Also, the person you ask for help can be smarter than you. They can be more experienced and know more about something than you do. For an example, I thought you could use your hands in soccer but I asked my brother who plays soccer and he told me that you can not use your hands. Also they can be stronger than you and they would know which weight to use if your just starting. This is one of my reasons why I think its good to ask for other peoples opinions.

In addition, you can tell them what they did wrong. Say if they are making a project on a volcano and they were saying that the lava was purple. I could tell them that its not purple and they could get a better grade. Also, along time ago when I was in fourth grade I was really good at social studies. we had this project on the presidents, therefore we had to group up, so I grouped up with my friend. But he was not the smartest, so I wrote what the presidents were famous for and he wrote the presidents in order. On the day the project was due he had put all the presidents in the wrong place luckily we had a test on it so I new all of them. Therefore I helped him glue them the right order. Then when she graded them we got an one hundred on the project. This is one of the last reasons why you should ask for other peoples opinions.

Finally, it is important to ask for other peoples opinions because if you do not ask or give people opinions they could be totally wrong on something without even knowing. They could also get bad grades because they did ask other people before the test. you cold also be in a life threatening a cation were you would need to know something but you did not ask for other peoples opinions. This is why I think getting multiple opinions is important.                   ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
20498D2BFDBE,"The reason people seek mutiple advice, it can be different tips, some might seek other help, and may benefit you in certain ways for your personal life style.

FIrst taking tips frim other people may help you through out life and may help you learn a different style. For instance, when playing basketball you might have to take some tips from your coach. When on certain plays if your running the play and its not benfiting your team you can ask for a better way to make the play succesful. And may be a way you be able to become a pro at that style of coaching you have got taught.

Second another reason people talk to more than one person is cause you might learn a different way. For example like you might be asking visual person how to explain something and they can't cause they learn by someone showing, them how to do it and you learn by somebody telling you or explaining how to do that particular thing.

Or they might know have taken the course you took in high school or college or may be talented in that work of field, or sport, job etc.

Last but not least personal life style is very important for you at a young age to learn a little bit about the changes, you that he or she might go though and you may need to talk to your mom or dad about when it is the right time or bring it up if yall on that topic. Maybe be about how to find a good house and the connection to people that your parents know that help get an deal on your first car, furniture, clothes, bills, and other personal questions you might .

However the might be good reason and all but not all you will most people might know ho to do this teach they self and some of us are independent im not saying its bad to be dependent on some things but you don't people to use you get you in trouble or can get in some mess with the law. And it will mess yo up expesically if you do sports if you get to big league like the Nba, Nfl,Mlb,Fifa you can get suspended sued have to pay a fine if you do something may get in trouble for smoking or being in some drive by dont just hang around people that gonna miss lead you hang around the people that's gonna lead yo in the right way .

My Conclusion is that it is helpful for asking for different people opinion but don't get the wrong perspective on certain things like if he or she needs to know about there bidy changes then ask your parents, or if you want to know about a certain thing abiut the field you then ask a friend you can trust or a family member you can trust about that particular thing you want to do, or a coach about certain way sto get better at what your set your goal to get there and that my conclusion sincerely eric  ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
446DFCDAD7F4,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Seeking more than one opinion can lead you to make better choices because of a multitude of reasons these are just three.

First and foremost there is usually more than one way to do one thing, if you ask for more than one opinion chances are that you will find the easiest way to accomplish your goal. Second you are most likely not the first one to face this problem so if you ask for multiple opinions you will most likely find some one who had this problem before you and they will have the answer then with multiple answers you can choose the best one from the bunch. The last reason is all about information if know one has the answer then they will at least have information to give if you have all the knowledge you need you will make the best answer.

My first reason is that there is more than one way to do just about anything so if you ask for multiple opinions than you may discover the easiest way.

I personally do not know every thing so when I have a question a ask multiple people. Now with that in mind I am also lazy so I like to take the easiest way out when I find all of the information that I need, I pick the easiest way so this way I do not have to do much if any work and I get the my question solved correctly. although most of my questions and problems stop with grandma who I have a lot of respect for. She is vary wise and old because she is so old she has gone through most of my problems and more.

Speaking of old, wise, and problems that's our next topic.

The second reason I have is that people before you have probably faced the problem you have know. So if you were to ask for more than one opinion from the people who have done this before you. Then you should get a collection of different answers so from that you just pick the best one. For example in the sixth grade I had to do a history project on an important time period the United States of America so i choose world war two. My only problem was I didn't know any details about the war so I went to the oldest person I knew my Grandma while we were talking about it some other old people overhead us talking (read eavesdropped on us) so I got there opinions as well. So because I got multiple opinions I got more information than i had origanily hoped for. I had so much information in fact that I didn't choose just one I took the best from all of them and made my own, and that brings us to our finial topic.

The last topic of the day is that when you get more opinions than just one you get more information to better choose your answer, because when you have more information you make better designs.

When I don't know a thing about what I am saying I tend to make pore decisions but when am knowledgeable I make good decisions.

A example of that is when i wanted to go swimming in a pond once i did not know there were leaches in there so when i went swimming i got a leach (I named him bill until I figured out he was a bad thing then I screamed for mom) it was not a good idea. two years later i was going to go swimming in another pond but then i remembered ""Oh wait what if this pond has leaches so I did my research no leaches it has snakes though I think I will just read a book instead.""

See when you have information you make good choices.

their is more than one way to do any thing if you ask around you will find the easiest way. your elders have done this before they usually have an answer for you so ask them in fact ask several of them. having information helps you make the best choice possible the best way to get information is to ask multiple sources and opinions. When people ask for advise, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This why asking for multiple opinions is a great way to make the best decision possible.   ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
37FED48BEDBD,"You are in a relationship with a boy named Generic_Name and everything is going well. You are also best friends with a girl named Generic_Name, who starts to become jelous becuase of how much time you are spending with Generic_Name, so she tells you to make choice him or me. now you have two choices to make eithier to stay with Generic_Name or go with Generic_Name you do not know what to do so you ask for advice from friends, family and neighbors and they tell you something diffrent but you are happy because now you have diffrent opptions to choose from than the ones you had in mind.

When people need advice they should talk to more than one person because they might get a better alterniative choice than what they had before, or they could see what their neighbors,friends and family would do in your situation, or they might give you great tips that you could you in the future.

The first reason people should get advice from more than one person is because you might get a better option than what they had mind, like for instance lets go back to the story ,and lets say the child was gonna tell her friend off by telling her that she was a loser and that she never liked her anyways or that she should cry herself a river and build herself a bridge and get over the fact that she spending most of her time with Generic_Name. But instead you sat her friend down and tell her that she did not mean to spend all her time with Generic_Name or you might even go out to lunch togather and talk about whatever was bothering you. Which would be a way better outcome than the first exsample.

The second reason people should get advice from more than one person is because it is better to hear what your neighbors, friends, and family would do in your situation because you might not agree with the first advice you get. For exsample lets say the child in the story asks her neighbor what she should do and they tell her to punch the girl now you may or may not agree with that but you always have your friends and family but maybe your friends tell you to leave Generic_Name your other friend and stay with Generic_Name but you do not like that choice either, so you go to your family and they tell you to do what you think is right so you think about it and you sit your friend down to talk.

the third and last reason you should get advice from more than one person is because someone might give you tips that you could use in the future. Like maybe your aunt has been through what you are going through and wants to give incouraging words like let your heart deside not your friends or you will know who is best for you. Or maybe your grandma tells you that if your friend can't be happy for you then she is not a good friend which you could use when you are older like if someone cant love you then they are not the one for you and that you will find the right person oneday maybe not right now.

Inconclusion getting more than one persons advice is best because we do not know everything and depending on only one persons advice can be quite unsettling at times so leaning on other people opioions can help a lot now we might not like what one person says but thats why we always have other peoples advice to usecso we should use all the advice that comes our way.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

1C554F1D9D75,"Most people find that when they are faced with a hard decision, they seek advice from their peers. But why do we do this? As humans we are natural team workers this means whenever we are come in contact with a problem, or choice we work together to figure out the best possible out come. I believe that this is a very good trait to have because when we have a choice to make we learn the different perspectives of your friends, peers and learn all the mistakes and choices not to make.

Learning different perspectives when making a decision is very beneficial to you. You can find out all of the pros and good outcomes like money, seeing new places or you could learn all the cons like spending less time with family and loved ones, or being stressed out. I believe it knowing different perspectives and views becomes very useful and helpful when making sure that your choice will ultimately lead you to happiness. However you still need to be educated on all the ways to keep out of trouble and in check by learning all the mistakes and errors you can make when making a choice.

In the process of making a decision discovering all the areas where mistakes and errors can be made is imperative. learning how to go over every small detail could play a big part in your final decision like going over how much free time you will have, if you wont be dumped with work constantly. Learning how to handle situations with communication and problem solving skills will help you indefinitely when coming to a conclusion. Listening to other peoples mistakes also helps you decide when to actually confirm and make your choice because some people wait to long or they make their decision to fast and it ends up not working out in their favor. this also another reason why I strongly believe that taking advice from your peers when making a decision is a very important part of the process.

The decision making process while being extremely difficult is very important you make decisions everyday of your life like what your going to eat, what you are going to wear but some of your decisions might be more important. When it come to those big decisions, life changing decisions i believe that you should tackle those on your own but with your friends, family and experienced personnel. Taking advice helps change the way you think and sometimes chnages your whole mindset, in making a decision knowing every possible outcome and point of view could be the difference of your life being really awesome or it being misserable and depressing. Thats why I believe seeking advice is super beneficial when coming to a conclusion.   ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
92933212F4D9,"Advice is when a person gives their honest opinion and feedback to someone, and what they would do if they were in that situation. Many people ask multiple people for advice because seeking multiple, different opinions helps you see the situation in a different perspective. Some people may have already experienced a similar situation to yours and could give you advice on what they did and how it resulted. Asking for advice from different people also give you a more variety of ways to approach the situation and how to handle the situation properly. If you don't ask anyone for advice, you would not have any knowledge on how to handle the situation correctly.

Asking for just one persons advice would also not let you grow as a better and stronger person. Asking for advice shows people that you are a person willing to learn new ways to make smart choices. Sometimes, it's good to learn things on your own, but in some situations, we might need help and advice on. Sharing advice with other people is also a good idea because you may have experienced something someone else hasn't, and you could help guide them into the right pathway by helping them make a smart decision. It's always important to give advice to others because they would be willing to give you good advice aswell.

For example, someone could ask a close friend or family member for parenting tips. Parenting can be challenging for some adults and maybe a little easier for others. Once an adult enters parenting, they most likely have absolutely no way on how to approach the pathway of having children. So, they could ask close friends or family members that already have children for specific advice. This allows the parent to learn more about how to properly take care of their child. Asking a friend or relative for parenting advice when they don't have any children, would not help the parent learn about how to properly take care of their child. They might ask multiple people for their advice about parenting, because it educates them different ways other ways parents raise and guide their child.

I remember I had a problem that had to do with school. At the beginning of this school year, I would put so much effort into my assignments. I did this because I wanted to prepare myself for high school and get into a good college. As the year slowly went by, I felt overwhelmed by the idea of transitioning into high school and all of the work I would have to do. I had the chance to hear some high schoolers talk about how they managed their school work and activites. They told me that even though school is important, it's always good to give yourself time to enjoy your youth and spend your time wisely. I've never recieved advice and feedback like this before because I've never thought about how fast time goes by and that I don't want to spend all my time and energy on school. I've now realized that school is a key priority, but self care is also a priority. This year I have made a lot of new friends and made many great memories. And I thank all high schoolers who have helped me realize life just isn't about school.

Giving someone advice can have such a big impact on them. Everyone eventually gets to a point in life where they just don't know what to do when a problem stands in their way. And many people are scared to ask others for advice because they might not want to share their problem but really need the help. You could ask multiple people for advice, and might follow one persons advice and not the others. And that is okay, because they're just giving their honest opinion about what they would specifically do if they were in your shoes.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
A6E992C5C8BC,"Do you ask more than one person for advice? When people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help them make a better decision. One person's opinion may not be very good, it would not help the person looking for advice make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinions from different people would benefit the person that needs advice. The benefits would include: making a better decision, helping the person decide, and it would be smarter.

Advice from different people will help someone make a better decision. One person may tell someone bad advice, resulting in a bad decision. It is better to get many opinions from different people; it would help someone figure out the right thing to do. The opinion most people tell you, is most likely the best decision.

Multiple opinions would help someone decide what to do. The person asking for advice may get told one thing by someone, then one thing by another. Asking three or more people would help the person asking for advice; it would help them see which one is the best decision. People would most likely listen to the advice more people tell them.

Asking three or more people would be smarter, people sometimes tend to not make the smartest decisions, therefore, if two or more people tell you the same opinion, it is most likely the smartest decision. Not listening to anyone's opinions will not always be a bad thing, people may know what's good for themselves. People still make bad choices, thinking they're right; it is still best to ask for other people's opinions.

In conclusion, listening to multiple people's opinions when asking for advice has many benefits. Asking more than one person for advice will help someone make a good decision, it would help them decide easier, and it would be a smarter decision, aswell.

37A2E6EA2337,"When people ask others for advice, they tend to talk to more than one person. To get more guidance from others that could possible lead them the right way. Seeking advice from other people can help because their advice can lead you in the right direction and there are challenges that we all go through in life.

Their advice can lead you in the right direction. Seeking God for help. Yes, I know most people don't believe in god and it is okay, but for those who do God makes things happen for a reason. He takes people out of your life and gives you advice even when you don't ask. You may not know when he does, but he does. Also, family knows best. Other than yourself, family should be the closest people to you and they know more about you then others. Their guidance can rub off on you. Lastly, friends. Lots of people go to friends about things that worry them or things they want to talk about. Friends can help you with experience that they or someone they know has went through. Even if you don't think so, all these people in your life always know what's best for you and are good people to go to when you need them.

There are challenges that we all go through in life. People with the same experience. You may not know or haven't asked, but some people that you are close with have probably gone through the same experience you have and can help you through whatever you are going through. Being comfortable with others. I feel as if that is a big key in seeking advice from others, you should be comfortable with them. Be able to trust them and tell them things without the fear of them telling someone else. Lastly obstacles. There isn't a day in life where we haven't all had an obstacle we had to face. No, I'm not talking about like playground obstacles I mean real life ones. Like challenges, bad experiences we've had to face. I would never want to got through a bad experience alone and would want to seek someone else for help. You may not think anyone can help you, but it's more than just a 3 step process.

However, I understand how others may not care, or don't give the right advice at times and make every experience you have about to them. That has happened to me many times. Yet, no one knows you better than you know yourself. It is scientifically proven that no one knows you better then you know yourself. About 65% of people go to others about their problems.

Getting advice from others is better though because their advice can lead you in the right direction and there are challenges we all go through in life. At the end of the day try to always get advice from someone other than yourself, you never know what will happen.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
D569BD3E20CD,"Good advice can be hard to find. People tend to ask a few members of their family or friends for advice. Why do they do that exactly? Well here is why.

Have you ever asked for advice from someone and then use the advice you got? It could be good, but It could also be bad. You could feel betrayed by the fact that someone trusted could've given you bad advice, but maybe they just couldn't relate to the situation you were in. That could lead you to the next question,"" Then why didn't they be honest about the fact that they didn't have the best advice you needed"". Well maybe, they just wanted to help because they care. Maybe they just want to grow a deeper connection between the two of you. Whatever the reason is, you shouldn't just seek important advice from one specific person unless you really trust them.

Well, if you shouldn't just ask one person for advice, then you should ask many right? Wrong! You can't just ask any random person about advice for your problems. You should always ask members of your family or your trusted friends. Maybe they won't always have the best advice for you which is why you can ask the next person. I myself am religious, so I often pray to the Lord. I find peace in the mind that way, so I then find my own advice. But no matter who it is you should always multiple people for advice because once you have, you decide on what is the best advice for you and hopefully it is the advice that works out in your favor. If it is the correct advice, the connection between you and that person is strong.

Asking a few people for advice is a great thing because friends and family are supposed to be there for you when you are in need. And when you get all the advice you need, don't be too hasty to make decisions. Instead, think it over because advice can determine friendships, relationships, tough decisions, and more. Think hard because there will probably be no turning back.   ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
2319365E6640,"Why does people intend to ask multiple people for an advice? Asking more than one person for an advice is usually better than asking one person, because asking one person does not have enough evidence than asking for more than one person. Some people ask multiple people to see which of the advice is said a lot more. That way, the people that ask, knows which advice is better to use and which advice is true.

One example of people asking multiple answer or advice is Steve Harvey from the show 'Family Feud'. The crew and Steve, go around the city and ask more than multiple people for their answer to a specific question. Steve usually says ""We ask 100 men or women"". That is Steve Harvey asking multiple people for an answer to one question. Why do you think Steve did that? Well he did that to see which answer is the most said and use it for the number one answer.

I usually ask more than one person for an answer to see which one of the answer is said the most. Some people might say, the answer is C and some people might say the answer is D. That is very confusing to me since there is 2 answers and the question only allow me to picked one. So what i did was, i asked 2-4 people and see which answer they said the most. What i got was 3 people picking the answer C and 1 person picking the answer D. In this case more people chose the answer C than D, so i picked the answer C.

Asking for more than one person is a good thing because it can help someone to make a better choice. Some people may be shy to ask multiple people, but sometimes it can make you get a better answer. Some people are made to help each other. Try asking and see if they answer, if they don't answer, then ask another person for an answer. Asking 1-3 people is not a bad thing, but asking a few more people is better so that you know which answer really is the best.

In conclusion, asking multiple people can help you make a better choice. Asking multiple people is also good for an advice. If you are a mean person and you need an advice on how to be a better person, than the best way is to ask more than one person on how to be a better person. Some people may not believe this is true because they haven't experience it in their life. Asking multiple people is the best way to get an answer to any question you may have.              ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4
DF9961E08D51,"Getting advice from others helps you in many ways. Sometimes it may be hard to make decisions alone, and asking for other opinions is a good idea. Most of the time, the person you ask for advice from will be more responsible, have a clearer perspective, and may have even experienced the same problem as you. All in all, asking peers and adults for advice leads you to make a better choice than you would have if you hadn't asked for their opinions.

Asking friends for advice helps you gain a new perspective on your situation. Since other people aren't in in your shoes, they will be less biased when deciding what to do. I was once in a fight with my friend Generic_Name. I had told her a secret, and she was the only person I had told. When I found out that other people knew my secret, I was angry and decided to stop talking to Generic_Name completely. I assumed that she was to blame for telling others my secret. I missed having Generic_Name to talk to, but still couldn't believe she let out my secret. I decided to ask Generic_Name, a mutual friend of Generic_Name and I, for advice. After telling Generic_Name what had happened, she gave me her view on the situation. She told me that maybe someone had overheard me when I was telling Generic_Name my secret. I thought about it, and realized that this was likely what happened. I was being so stubborn and wasn't very open-minded about the situation because I had immediately assumed that Generic_Name had betrayed me. Generic_Name's advice was very helpful because she had a different perspective on what happened. The next day, I confirmed that Generic_Name's suspicions were true, and apologized to Generic_Name. If I hadn't asked Generic_Name for advice, I don't think I would have found out what really happened. An additional benefit of hearing the opinions of others is that they can help you make more responsible decisions.

It is important to ask adults for advice because they are more mature. Parents and elders can help you make smarter decisions that will help you for the future. A study done by Harvard University examined the brains of a 14-year old and a 40-year old. They discovered that the frontal lobe, which helps with decision making, was significantly more developed in the 40-year old than the teenager. They concluded that adults in general will think about the both the long- and short-term effects of the choice, while teenagers are likely to just make the more appealing decision for themselves in the present. For example, if asked to go out to a party, a teenager would say yes because they think that it will make them more popular. Now, if the teenager asked the adult if they could go to this party, the adult would take into account that the party would prevent the teenager from studying for an important test, and they would tell the teenager not to go. The adult's decision is much more practical for the future, while the teenager's decision will only benefit them for a short amount of time. Asking an adult for advice is also helpful because they may have been in the same situation as you before.

Adults are wiser and more experienced than kids. They have seen more issues and also have a better idea of how to solve them. One time, my cousin, Generic_Name, had to make a decision on whether or not he should join the school track team. He knew that it would be a fun experience, but also knew it would be very time-consuming. Generic_Name was also a member of both the soccer and football teams. He decided to ask his dad for advice since his dad had also been a high school athlete. His dad's advice helped Generic_Name with his decision. His dad told him that he had participated in three high school sports, and that he wished he hadn't. As a student, he struggled constantly and never had enough time to go to sports practice and finish his homework. Generic_Name's father also said that he only got about 5 hours of sleep each night. Generic_Name was glad that he had asked his dad for help. He decided not to do track after hearing his dad's advice. The previous experience of Generic_Name's dad helped Generic_Name to not make the same mistake. If Generic_Name hadn't sought out his dad's opinion, he would have struggled to do his schoolwork and would be tired during the school day. It is important to ask people for advice because most of them have already experienced many of the issues that you will go through.

When struggling to make a decision, hearing the advice of others is vital. Friends and family members can help you make smarter, more responsible decisions that will help you in the long-run. The reason that asking others is so beneficial is because they have a different perspective, are more mature, and have also been in more situations than you. The next time you have to make a choice, the best thing to do is to seek for the advice of others.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,1.0

Maybe that person has already tried the thing you wanna try he can give you his opinion on the item. If you wanna buy something first it's good to talk to someone who has bought the item they can tell you if it works or not. Maybe you wanna buy a car and some how the car doesn't work you gotta talk to the dealer ship about the car. Or if you wanna buy some medicen you have to ask first before you drink the medicen or else you can even die from it if it's bad for you.

And you have to talk to more then just one person to be sure because if you don't you can waste you money just like that. And you always have to be positive when people give you advice even you know they aren't saying things right they are just trying to help you. It's always good to give your opinion on things because maybe they aren't sure if they wanna buy the item or not. If you care about a person your going to give your advice to a person because they are some how confused on something you can help them. Giving advice is a way to be nice because you wanna prevent from that person to buy that item if they buy it and it doesn't work they are just going to waste money on the item.

Also by giving advice you can prevent people from getting hurt like if a guy walks to a store and buys something and it doesn't work he is going to come back to the store and fight the guy the sold him the item and then they both go to jail from fighting.

I believe it is a good idea to talk to more than one person because it can help you make a better choice in then end. Different peoples opinions can help build one strong one, different point of views are always good to hear and older more wiser people have been though lot's of stuff and it could be good to ask them too.

Asking for advice from many different people is the way to go. One person's advice could be pushing your in a bad direction thats why it's good to get multiple peoples thoughts. Different point of view are good on this topic because many some peoples advice can persuade you to make a bad opinion and if you get multiple peoples advice it can even it out and you can make a good opinion. Everyone has different views and it's good to see the whole picture.

Older's peoples advice is always a good choice to ask for because they have been though a lot and they have some good advice on what to say. Elders are much wiser than asking kids because they have already dealt with these sorts of things and you can trust them more than most people. Asking more than one Elder is what I would do because they are mostly right and have lot's of different views. Thats why asking many different Elders is good.

Different peoples opinions on advice can help build one big strong one. If you get the same advice from two different people and then you ask a 3rd person and they say the opposite of what the other people said, you would most likely pick the Advice that two people had said. Building a strong statement is key and if you get advice from many people that have done something like it, it will help make a good opinion. A strong opinion is the best opinion when it come to making choices and getting advice.

If you take advice from lot's of different people your outcome will be better than only asking one person. Using different points of views, using your elder's and even asking someone that you trust are all good ways to find some good advice. seeking more than one persons advice will help you make a much better choice.

A couple weeks ago, my civics teacher gave our class a project that was due the next day, but I had a basketball game the same day which would end at 8:30pm. Since I didn't know what to do I asked my friend who told me to go to my basket ball game and try to finish the project at home. After she told me this I asked my civics teacher and a couple of other friends who advised me to skip my basket ball game so that I could finish the project without any stress. Since most of the people I asked advise from told me to skip my basket ball game which then made me feel like it was the right decision I did which caused me to finish my project without any stress. Other than assuring yourself that you are making the right decision, you could also change your opinion.

People's opinions could change your decision. Asking more than one person who has the opposite opinion than you might persuade you to change your own opinion. Yesterday I asked multiple friends of mine for advice on what sport I should do. I could either do soccer which is every day from 4-8pm, or golf which is on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays for 5-6:30pm.

I really wanted to play soccer, but most of my friends told me that I would be stressed since it's right after school and every day. They told me that golf would be less stressful and will give me time to finish schoolwork or have time to spend with friends and family. Because of this, I chose to play golf which caused me to feel less stressed and gave me free time to spend with family and friends. Seeking advice from more than one person will allow you to not feel confused.

69A0715FA8A5,"Have you ever made a decision that you later regretted because you did not seek alternate opinions? Often times decision making can be a difficult task, particularly when you have little knowledge on the topic. Whenever I wish to make an informed and well-made decision I will usually ask my friends and others that I respect for their opinions on the matter. By having several different views on the subject, it assists me in making the best choice that I can. Sometimes I will go with my original idea, but on several occasions I have been heavily influenced after hearing other stances on the topic, and changed my own opinion. Seeking multiple opinions when making a decision can be very beneficial because it helps you in being more informed on the topic, it helps different views to be brought to light that can sometimes come from past experiences, and who knows, you may even be able to receive assistance in executing your final decision.

When you listen to other peoples' opinions on a specific matter a lot of times you will learn more about that topic. By hearing what other people have to say, you will often times learn a reasoning behind the way that they feel. This reasoning can sometimes come from something you did not know about the subject at hand, and therefore helps you in making a more informed decision. Some choices are based off of what will benefit the most people, in which you will want to hear everyone's opinion and know what will help them the most. Other decisions are made solely based on facts. Research can be helpful on a fact-based decision, but sometimes first-hand knowledge is the best.

Many people can have different views on one topic depending on their past experiences with that subject. When you hear all of these different views, you will not only learn more about the possible outcomes of your decision, but you will also learn about what has influenced other people who may have made the same decision. Even those that have not experienced making that decision first-hand will often times have helpful advice on how to make your decision, possible outcomes of what you decide, and they may even help you by showing what they think of the matter and how they would react to the given situation. Multiple views on one topic can help bring even more ideas to light, as well as even more possible solutions. By having more opinions, you also develop more choices that can be discussed and evaluated.

Whenever you are making an important decision you will usually have to execute that final choice. This can be hard to do alone sometimes, but when you listen to other people and show them that their views and opinions matter they will often times wish to help you in return. Not only will you be able to make an informed decision with reasoning to back it up, but you will have people behind you to support your decision and help to make it a reality. Some choices require careful evaluation in order to truly decide whether or not the efforts put in will be worth the final product. When you have assistance in achieving that final goal, it becomes much easier to not become caught up in the challenges and obstacles along the path to success. In addition to this, you will also have someone to refer to for a new view anytime that a problem arises while executing your final decision.

In conclusion, seeking several different opinions and views can be very beneficial when making a decision. By seeing new views and reasoning, you are able to make a much more informed choice. When you are able to hear first-hand stories about past experiences on the same situation, it can positively influence your decision. Finally, by showing others that their voice can be heard and that it will matter, they will often times want to assist you in achieving your final goal and executing your end decision. Anytime that I wish to make a choice that will benefit everyone I will make sure that I seek multiple opinions so that I can make the best possible decision.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.8

If your'e not so sensitive when taking others opinions then you should do so. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a decent choice because they can move forwards with there own opinion, learn something new from somebody else opinion, and know the point people are trying to make.

People can move forward with their opinion by taking in someone else opinion and not always there own. Someone else opinion might be a little more humble than your own opinion. It might be best to listen to others opinion's. people can take in something new from other people opinions. They can hear the other person out and they might be saying something helpful that you didnt know. lastly they can teach you something that needed to be heard. People can understand the point people are trying to make. It can lead you to success, It can get you farther than where youre standing now. And it can be a life lesson.

A lot of people take opinions from their best friends, family members, or someone they are really close with. It might be very rare for someone to take an opinion from somebody they hardly know. Some people take opinions from friendly people if they have a good attitude and good body language. Most people are afraid that people will give them bad opinions but its not always like that. Some people just have to look up to the right people for the right opinions. Very little people will give you bad opinions to see you fail.

Some people have negative opinions and might comment on anything you say. Or they might give you negative opinions themselves. Those are the people you dont listen to. They will bring you down and lead you to failure. You have to just ignore all of that and not take all of the negativity in.

Sometimes if you only ask one person for advice they can give you something they think is right in that situation but it can turn out not the right advice that you needed. But if you ask multiple people like three or four and see what the common opinion is you can take the right advice. And people tend to ask more than one people because they dont want to be provided the wrong advice. And if you are provided the wrong advice you cloud lose trust.

It is better to ask more than one person for many reasons for example if you ask one of your friends if what you should wear to a party and they give you what they they think. And then you go and see every body there is wearing a different style than yours. But that could have been avoided if you had asked the advice of four friends and then they could have given you the style that they thought was worn. Another example is if you ask one of your friends what you should get as a snack and they give you a bag of chips and later on you dont like the chips. But if you would have asked multiple friends what a good snack was they would have probably recommended a better snack than the chips. Or if you ask if you think you should ask somebody out and they say yeah or if you ask some more friends and they dont think its that great in idea to ask that person out.

The advice from a group would most likely be better than by asking one of your friends. Because if you ask one person whats in style. Than can give you some advice and then you take their advice and you wear it and people dont like it. Or if you need advice on what you should do in a situation and you ask one of your close friends what they thin you should do and they give you the wrong advice you cloud wind up doing the wrong thing in that situation. And sometimes they can lead you into the wrong things would get you in trouble. Or you cloud be put in a situation that you dont know what is right and you take the wrong advice could have a bad reputation or it could lead to you losing people you were close to. And you cloud hurt somebody if you do take the wrong advice which could lead to getting shamed.

And that is why asking more than one person is better than asking one person and that person only. because no matter who you ask youre probably going to get multiple answers but you can compare and see who has common advice. you want to ask the group so you dont get embarrassed in front of people or eat something that you dont like that isnt very popular among people. Or something you dont enjoy doing that person thinks is fun but it is a popular opinion to people. But if you ask a hand full of close friends or even just people you can see the common advice people will give of what they think they would do in your situation and you can see that more people think something else is right rather than the one or two people who thin something else is right.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6

People should seek for multiple opinions because it makes sure they aren't being controlled by only one person, it may give them different viewpoints they never would've considered, and it will give them more information about the topic that they never would've known.

More than one opinion will make sure they are not being influenced by only one person. If they are only asking for one persons advice, that person can take advantage of the situation and control them. For example, when I was in 5th grade, I would always go to the same person for advice. They would always tell me to do things I didn't want to do but nevertheless, I would always do whatever they suggested. In retrospect, I should've asked for more peoples opinions so that I could see that there were more paths to follow.

Multiple opinions may give them different viewpoints on a topic they might not have considered. If they only ask one person about everything, they will most likely follow that persons beliefs. They have to figure out for themselves what they think and not rely on others to make the tough decisions for them. For example, when I thought my friend had been spreading rumors about me, I wanted to confront her immediately. Before I disscused it with her, I asked multiple people if they knew anything and I'm glad that I did. They told me the allegations were false and I was extremely happy I didn't rush to conclusions and ended a friendship for no good reason.

More than one opinion will give them more information about the topic so that they can make a more educated choice. One person doesn't know everything. To make a full decision, you need to know all the facts. You wouldn't find everything out from one person. For example I had my heart set on a presidential candidate that I wanted to win. One day, the topic of the presidential election came up in conversation when I was discussing it with my friend. She told me other things about his platform that I did not support. I was happy that I talked to her about it because it showed me that I can't believe everything the media shows me.

People should seek for multiple opinions because it makes sure they aren't being influenced by only one person, it may give them different viewpoints they never would've considered, and it will give them more information about the topic they never would've known.

8AAA87E056FD,"Have you ever needed advice from someone? If so, you probably talked to multiple people before you went on with what you were going to do. Some of the many reasons people do this include getting different perspectives, see the other side of an issue, and get more information on the subject.

The biggest reason someone may ask another person for advice is because there are different perspectives that can go with a subject. You can talk to people you may not see eye to eye with and get insight on their differing opinion. This leads to good discussions with people on the topic you're trying to learn about through the information you're given.

With advice, you want to know the other side of something and if what you're going to do is right or wrong. You can develop potential arguments to strengthen your side and you can know everyone's views to go along with your subject. Based on what you learn from everyone, you could get the full circle of information on what you'd like to learn about.

Lastly, you get more advice as well from asking others for advice. You can learn from other's experience, and in the end learn from your own. You'll know what went wrong in what the person did and why you're getting that advice. Other people will also think one thing is more important than the other. You'll have an overall bigger decision to make in the end with who's advice you're going to follow and how you're going to do it.

7EEF498A0C92,"Everyone wants to the know the right choice. People usually look for another point of view to make make sure they are making the best choice possible. Seeking multiple opinions on a situation shows you another thought process than your own. When deciding on big things like collage or a wedding dress you want to be reassured your making the best choice possible. You'll never know if you made the best choice until you hear everyone's opinion. Almost 100% of the time somebody could have made a better choice than you and is willing to give input.

The first reason for asking for advice from more than one person is reassurance. Your brain always helps you choose the answer the inference is the best based on your past knowledge and your information on the subject. But no single person knows everything there is to know. Thats why we look to more than one point of view. No two people think the same exact way, because of that i'm always going to want to know what they think on said topic. Knowing how more than one person's train of thought works to get their answer helps me shift my thinking to assure that I have selected the best option possible.

Specifically, one example is deciding on a collage. When deciding on a collage you take advice from your guidance consular, parents, and collage representatives at fairs. Making such a big choice requires a lot of scouting and studying. When deciding on collages you look for a range of opinions to make the best choice according to the information you find. Your parents may have a different collage in mind for you than your teachers, thats when you use another point of view.

However, when consulting such a wide rage of views it may change your way of thought. If you were doing your homework and you asked what everyone else got and you got A, and they got D, it may lead to a learning experience that will become past knowledge. You may use that past knowledge sometime in the future and it will help you make a better choice than if you did not. However, you have learned a new skill that will help you in the future.

In conclusion, people ask more than one person for advice to make a better choice. They seek more than one persons advice because nobody has the same train of thought. Asking others for advice lets you see it from a whole new range of views. People seeking another thought process can help them make a better choice because you may think now that they've explained it to you that their option is a better option and helps you make the right choice. And because Almost 100% of the time somebody could have made a better choice than you and is willing to give input.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
E7CBE8FEFCDF,"When you go to seek advice sometimes only using advice from one person isnt always the best. So its better if you go to multiple people for advice because people see things differently and have different ideas and that can help you formulate your own advice.

Not everyone has the same idea and thats okay. Especially when your looking for advice. When you listen to others advice it can help you formulate your own advice. As the old saying goes ""Two heads are better than one"". So its better to have multiple friends to help you with advice rather than just one.

Another saying is ""Not everybody sees the light in the same way"". meaning not everyone sees things the same way. By using this to your advantage you can think about how your friends might see your problem you need advice for differently. Sometimes your friends might not have the smarts piece of advice to give you and thats okay just dont take there advice.

Once you take all your friends advice into account you can start to formulate your own advice by piecing all of your friends advice together. This can help you feel secure about the advice and to make sure it doesnt sound dumb. once you do that take your own advice and solve the problem your having. Then you will know how to solve a problem like that again multiple pieces of advice are helpful because they can help you formulate your own advice, see the advice from different angles, and get different ideas. once you master this you can help out your friends when they need advice. You can also help yourself next time.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

People dont just only ask or talk to one person when seeking for advice, they ask multiple people. The more people that give you advice, the more successful you will become in life and if you are going to do something that has a negative outcome, multiple people can change your mind.

Getting advice from multiple people can help you in life. Every person has different beliefs and views to everything and it can be very helpful at times. Someones advice can stick with you throughout your entire life and help you when you are in a tough spot. There could also be some misleading advice. For example if someone gives a piece of advice that you truly believe has a negative outcome, do not use it.

If you are going to do something that has a negative outcome, someones advice can stop you from doing it. Some advice makes you rethink a situation and change the outcome. If you think a situation is bad and you ask someone advice, it can be very helpful. If you think someone is in a bad situation, you give them some advice too. If you give someone your advice they will be very thankful and might do the right thing.

In conclusion advice is beneficial. If someone gives you advice, you should cherish it. Advice can come from anyone, not just people you know. Advice goes a long way and it has a great impact on people. There is a also bad advice and you need to watch out for too.

Advice makes a person more successful and helps them not do negative actions towards themselves or others.                                                                                                        ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.4

This is nothing to be ashamed of because people are smart, and the more people thinking about what to do in a situation, the better the solution is. When someone is making a tough decision it is crucial that they talk to others before making a final decision. First of all, by talking to other people you might find that they have better solutions that you never thought of because you were too close minded. Secondly, having others agree with your decision can make you feel more confident in your choices. Lastly, sometimes simply by telling someone your decision you yourself can find things to improve on.

Talking to multiple people before making a decision can help you find other solutions that you never would have considered. For example, last summer I was deciding whether or not to apply to Generic_School. Currently, I was planning on not applying because I didn't believe I would stand a chance and I did not want to waste 100 of my parents dollars. This all changed when I asked my mom for her opinion. When I told her my plan she said to me, ""Well, you will never know if you can make into Generic_School it if you don't try."" This inspired me and made me realize that it is not a waste of money if I try my best and work hard. This is a prime example of how consulting others can open your eyes to make better decisions.

A second reason to ask multiple people for their opinion is because knowing that others agree with you on a choice you are making can make you feel more confident in that choice. After my mom changed my mind and convinced me to apply to Generic_School I continued to ask others if they thought I was making the right choice. Having others, such as my dad, brother, and close friend, agree with me made me even more confident that I was making the right choice.

The final reason why asking others about the decision you are making is the right thing to do is that telling someone your thought process to reach a decision may expose to you any flaws that can be fixed. Think back to a time when you were writing a paper. After working on it for a couple of hours you were sure you had worked out all of the mistakes. Then suddenly when you went to read it to someone you realized that there are so many grammar flaws that you just did not realize when writing the paper. I believe that it is the same with decisions. If someone simply tells someone else their decision they might realize something that they do not think is right and change their decision. By simply telling someone your decision you could save yourself from making a bad choice.

Talking to others before making a decision is the best thing you can do for yourself. Even though someone may think they are making the best decision it is always helpful to get other opinions because maybe someone else has a better idea. Having someone agree that you are making the right decision can help you feel more sure that you made the right decision. Even if neither of these things are the case, by telling someone your decision and the thought process behind it you may find a kink in the process that when worked out, can help you make a better decision. All of these reasons are why I am asking you to ask others for advice before making a decision, because you know what they say, two minds are better than one.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent,0.6
