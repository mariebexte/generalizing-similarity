I think the best policy to implement would be policy two, not allowing students to have phones at all. If students were to be allowed cell phone usage during certain times in the day then they would be tempted to use them during class and then precious class time would be wasted on punishment. A phone ringing during class is a distraction not only to the person whose phone it is, but to all the pupils in the room. Also, cell phones could be used to cheat on assignments.

Lets say a teacher is in the middle of an important lecture and a phone goes off. She has to stop what she is doing and waste time figuring out whose phone rang and take time to punish that child. By this time the whole period is wasted because the teacher and the students have lost focus on the subject at hand all because of one cell phone. This wouldn't have happened if the student didn't have a cell phone. Then that pupil would still lose class time by sitting in a principals office or suspension.

Cheating is a shameful act that can hinder a student's educational career. Cell phones can be used to call or text message someone and ask the answer to class work or a state exam. A student taking the SAT could text message their friend and ask the answer to a question. This isn't showing what the student knows, it showing what their friend knows! The test could make the difference between a passing grade and a failing grade for that course. In many schools if you are caught cheating you could be suspended or expelled, and in colleges you are expelled, no questions asked.

I don't like to be distracted when I am working because I lose my train of thought and I'm not focused on what I am doing. This view is shared among many students, so if a cell phone goes off they will become distracted and, as I said, lose focus on their work. This could lower their grade for that assignment and cause their grade for the class to lower too.

I believe cell phones should not be allowed at school because they waste class time, can be used to cheat, and can distract other students. I",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I have heard that you are trying to decide between two cell phone policies for the school. I believe that the first cell phone policy, that states students are allowed to bring cell phones to school but they must be turned off during class, is the best choice for the students. In this letter, I will explain to you the advantages of students being allowed to bring cell phones to school. I will also explain why you must trust your students and give them some freedom.

If students could bring their cell phones to school, it would have advantages to the teachers and the students. For example, if a student forgot their homework at their house, they could possibly call a parent and see if the parent could bring the homework to the school. The student would get a better grade on the homework because it wasn't late. Also, the teacher wouldn't have to wait for the student to turn the missing assignment in. Another advantage of students bringing their cell phones to school is that they could use it to plan ahead. Many students, today, have cell phones and are using them constantly. If a student were to use the calendar inside their phone, they could have their phone send them alerts for things such as when a project is due, if they need to study for a test tomorrow, ect. As you can see, students bringing their cell phones to school would have it's advantages for the students and the teachers.

If students brought their cell phones to school, the students would feel more trusted and that they have more freedom. If students feel more trusted, the students would be more likely to act more maturely. The student would feel as if the principal has high standards for them, and when high standards are met, you get more freedom. If the principal gave the students the freedom of using cell phones in school, they would try harder in school to keep their various freedoms, instead of acting immaturely and loosing their freedom of using cell phones in school. If students had more freedom, they would feel more trusted.

As you can see, their are many advantages in letting students bring their cell phones to school. Students would use their cell phone if they forgot their homework or in case of emergency. They could use their cell phones to become more organized. Students would also feel more trusted and live up to higher standards in order to keep their freedom of using cell phones in school. I hope you consider my suggestion.

Sincerely,

Cell phones should be allowed in schools, but only in the lunch periods and other free times. For certain reasons, some students forget work at home and they need there parent to bring it to school for them. If there parents are able to bring there work then the student wouldn't get a missing assignment or project. A reason why they shouldn't be allowed in classrooms is that they could cheat on a test.

Students feel more comfortable when they have there phone, I know that I feel more in touch with my parents and friends. Lets say there is a family emergency, or soccer practice got cancelled its a nice thing to know ahead of time so you can schedule out your homework, or after school plans. You cant stop students to not have there phones someone is going to use it. Even if schools try to enforce the ""no cell phone rule"" there will be students secretly using it.

Cell phones these days have the latest technology on them. You can check your email, grades that are online , and also the internet so its easy to look up an answer to a test . Cell phones are almost just like computers. They should DEFINATLY not be allowed in the classroom, me being a student and having to not use my cell phone is a struggle. Every student can go with out 6 hours without one though, and ever so often when your in the halls or at lunch you get to take a glace at your phone.

I vary with both sides of this argument. If you allow them to have it in the halls and lunchroom, the school would be more ""loved"" by the students that go to school there. Its also not a good thing for students to be cheating on tests. I think if you could have cell phones allowed but only for emrgency, or if your really need to use it, but should only be used in the halls or at lunch .In this case i agree with having students being allowed to have there cell phones, but are limited to where they can use them.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Imagine kids finally paying attention in class. Wouldn't that be great! I believe you should follow the first policy. Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during luch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off. This is going to take affect as soon as possible. This will happen in SCHOOL_NAME

school.

I believe that you should follow policy number one because maybe if it is important they can take the call or the text message during the lunch periods. for example my good friend is a textaholic. She loves to text. If you allow using phones during lunch periods maybe she wont have to get written up for using her phone in class.

Every day a student here has to argue for their phone back. It is getting on my last nerve so much that sometimes i have to argue back at the security! Maybe if you let us text we won't have to disrespect the teachers n this school. You already took every fun thing out of our lifes why cant we just have a little bit of fun and text during lunch periods?

Every day a parent has to come in and get a students phone back. Aren't you tired of these students not listening to you? Just give them a break and let them use their phones! what is a kid going to do bad with a phone? Is the kid going to threaten another school mate wit a phone? I don't think so. Are kids going to throw phones at other kids heads for the fun of it?

You need just a break. If you keep making up new rules then more students are going to disrespect you and not follow the rules. Instead of letting them not use their phones you should give them a certain time when and when not to use their phones. If you were us students wouldn't you feel the same way?? Reconsider letting us use our phones and we promise we will make it our worth while!",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6
9ABAA03ACB4B,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I personally feel rethinking the policy of having cell phones in school is a great idea. In my opinion, having cell phones at school would be a privilege. I have came up with two reasons why having cell phones at appropriate times should be a school policy.

First of all, in this generation having a cell phone with you is a must. You always see teens with cell phones. Teens and cell phones are like alcoholics and alcohol.

You can't keep them apart, or they become a mess. Teens are addicted to cell phones. Even when they're not suppose to use their cell phones, they do it anyways. Giving them the privilege to use their phones at school at appropriate times could increase the number of students that get in trouble because of their cell phones.

Secondly, cell phones could help in case of emergencies. During an emergency you can't always reach a telephone. If teens could have cell phones at school getting in touch with a family member wouldn't be a problem. Announcing on the intercom the appropriate time when to get in touch with a family member could help out a lot.

In conclusion, you changing the policy to, ""yes students can use their cell phones at appropriate times"" could make an impact on the school. You can always make more exceptions to the policy for those who don't abide by it. I hope you take my letter into consideration, and that my reasons why we should have cell phones in school makes an impact. Thank you for your time and patience.

My name is STUDENT_NAME.

Today i am here to talk to you about our cell phone policy here at school. Everyone has there different opinion on it. I'm writing this to tell you mine.

My opinion is that we should be allowed to have our phones in school, and use them during lunch, or free times, but have them off in class. i think if we do this students will, or should have them off in class cause we get to us them any other time. if they do have them on in class, this privilege should be taken away. As a student, I would use my phone during lunch, and free periods. when I'm in a class, or not allowed to use it, i wouldn't use it because we can already use it at another time, and if we want to still be able to use our phones in school, i would not use it when I'm not supposed too.

Reason's why we should be able to have our phones in school:

- some students walk home, or ride a bus, in case of emergency, we need phones to contact someone.

- If allowed, to use phones, during free times, students wouldn't be up walking around, yelling across the room, and just be wild. we could text that person, and talk to them that way instead.

- if we earned the right to have our phones in school, we should be able to have them.

one problem would be, not being concentrated in class. i think that as long as you tell them they have to keep there grades up, and earn it, they can have phones. if only a few students haven't earned the right to have there phone in school, they can't have it.

things student's have to do to earn it:

- keep grades up.

- get good grades on test / quizzes.

- be responsible.

- don't get in trouble.

- do what your told.

- no punishments at home.

- listen to parents.

if all goes well, we should be able to have our phones. if it would become a problem, and was not working, it should be taken away. if a student is caught with there phone in class, they should get it taken away, a parent should have to come pick it up, and they can' t use there phone is school anymore. if they proceed to do so, it would get taken away, a referral should be given, along with detention, a phone call home, and a parent would have to pick it up again. thank you for taking the time to read this. i ask you to please take this into consideration.

thank you once again.

75F35B39F4AA,"I think there should be no cell phones in school because that can be a very big distraction to students. That is a very bad idea. This me opinion no student is going to follow this politely these are a bunch of immature kids and will not follow this rule. Some kid will think it is all right to have cell phone in class. Kids will use the cell phone to cheat on a test get the right answerers and not pay attention in class and to distracted by the cell phone. And just because you say put the cell phone during class but you allow it during lunch or free time. They are going to take that granite and expect to have there cell phone out . And they are going to finds ways to have there cell phone and once you let them have there cell phone you can never take that back.

9C4B06B51CFC,"I think that policy 1 is the best choice depending on the school. Elementary schools shouldn't allow the use of a cell phone during free time because the students may not be able to handle using a phone in a proper manner. Middle school and high school students on the other hand are young adults and should be able to handle using a phone with out disrupting another student. There should be limits though like no getting on the internet with your phone, no calls depending on where the student is at that time. At middle school and high school, kids don't really get the kind of free time that adults think they do and its because there is nothing to do, no games, nothing. There might be a couple of friends to talk to but that's it. There are some kids that have no friends in that specific class that they get free time in. So there should be something else to do other than sit down and watch everyone else talk with their friends. And as long as they keep their phones of in class they should be able to use it during free time. So that's why I thing that policy 1 is the best way to go.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
F0DBA31AF30C,"Dear Principal,

The policy I believe is better is Policy 1 because if students actually pay attention in class they should get some time to talk to there friends by text or by calling them and asking them how has there day been and talk about any problems they have been having at all in the day. To me policy 1 is the best choice to go with because nothing wrong is happening as long as they text or talk about good things and not bad things in class or outside of class, but the phones should not be turned on in class at all times.

If students get the chance to text at school in lunchtime they should earn it as long as they behave good. The phones shouldn't be turned on while in class because then it would get in the way of there studying and their class work also. To me policy 1 is the best way to go, policy 2 is not the best way to go with because what if an emergency or some other thing happened how will they contact you or you contact your parents. That is one reason another reason is students have the authority to be able to use there phone, why cant they I know it gets in the way of there class work but they might need it some day in the future in case of an emergency. But there phone also gets in the way of there studying and of there work so that is the backside to it, but students should be able to use there phones no matter what happens.

Policy too says that phones are not allowed at school, that is not a good thing students should be able to have there phones with them but turned off that's easy that is what the principal should have done in the fist place or they could've also told students to bring there phones have them turned on only answer emergency calls, and be able to answer them but not text or call your friends while at school, that is another policy that could have been done but since those aren't policies than policy 1 is the best policy to go with.

Policy 2 is not the best policy because why shouldn't students be able have phones with them at school, they should be able too, they have the right, nobody can say that they cant have phones with them or bring phones to school. The students have the right nobody can say that they cant bring phones, whoever says that does not know what they are talking about. Students should be able to bring phones and text there friends because they just want to talk and hang out with them, what is that wrong to do, I say no because it is just there friends, nothing is wrong with that. Students should be able to bring phones to school and have them turned off during class but on during lunch, nutrition, break, and between going to your next class.

Policy 1 is the best policy to go with because students get to use there cell phones at school , and in policy 2 students do no get the chance to bring them or to use them. That to me is not a cool policy because students should get the chance to use phones at school.      ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
D972C6918584,"Dear Principal,

Tick tock what is that noise, that is the sound of the clocks going off to switch classes and the time for all cell phones to start going off.

I believe that all cell phones should be aloud at school for many reasons, but a few reasons would have to be because what if someone had an emergency out of the classroom or in the bathroom you would obviously need a phone or something for them to call for help. Also i think that all students should have cell phones no matter what because some students might go home with friends or go home by themselves, and all parents need to get in touch with their children to make sure they made it home safe!

Students get there phones taking up so much during school because they either get a phone call or a text message during class because they forget to turn their phones off or they just leave them on vibrate and that is not allowed. I think if they made a phone policy to use them only for emergency's or specific purposes then we would probably not have as big of problems as we have been having.

I agree with policy 1 that they should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as their turned off during class time. I think if every student in middle school wrote a paper to a principal saying they would only use their cell phone's for emergency's only then I believe that they might would allow them to stay on and stay with them at school.

I hope that each principal at each middle school will get this letter and look back and think that if each student listens to this and follows these proper directions and don't use there phones during class then they might make this a rule to have cell phone's back!",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I support Policy 1 because students can listen to music in there free time and have them off in class. The students would also have a happy day other then having there phones or iPods out during class and get in trouble and then be mad at the school.

Another bonus with this policy is that if they are caught with there phones or iPods teachers can take them away and give them back to the students at the end of the day.

Policy 2 just makes students want to test the school and see if you are kidding or not you would have more students in detention from having there phones or iPods out then anything else. Policy 1 has Students have a time to themselves and listen to there type of music. Most teens in that slide show had there phones out in hallways, in the library or when they were at lunch, well basically there free time to do what they want and to be independent , most teachers care if a student has a phone out during class time but if you follow policy 1 students wouldn't be mad a teachers and students wouldn't have break outs at the teachers.

The students should follow Policy 1 , so they can have a time just to themselves and chill. I strongly agree with Policy 1. I strongly disagree with Policy 2, kids would get mad more kids would test the school to see if they are serious and then find out the consequences but do it over and over again.

Parents may also be happy with policy 1 cause parents could check in on there kids and make sure they bring home what they need and if they have to stay after. Parents could also have there kids call from there cell if they need something cause then students don't need to call from a school phone and make parents think they are in trouble to most parents may or may not like this policy, some parents might not like either policy. But it doesn't hurt to try and see if it works out and if it does then keep it, if it doesn't go back to your old Policy.

A lot of students would be happy if the school followed this policy. But more stealing might happen cause students would have it out and someone could just walk by and take it and they would never know. I had my phone stolen from me out of my pants when i was at gym, students could have this same thing happen to them. They would have to put all that stuff in a safe and proper place during class like their locker or there backpack.

We won't pay attention so cause of texting but that's why you turn it off during class time. And use them during free time, and they shouldn't take them when they go off in class.

I have heard that you may be considering letting the children have cell phone at and during school hours. My personal opinion on this is that student should not have cell phone at school for many reason. for example it a decisions it may cause student to cheat on test and finally way do u need cell phone at school anyway your friends are at school.

I Think that cell phone should not be at school for many reason but one reason would be why do u even did your phone at school when your friends are their. what I don't understand is when cell phone are such a problem at school. I know kids think they have better plans then school but i think they should have some thing to decision them also .

Cell phone shouldn't be used during school because their many thing u can do to get your self in trouble. Cell phone been the number one thing that get kids in trouble at school the reason for this is because student are texting in class. which make no nice to me I mean if its that important then it can be told out side in the hall way.

what student don't realizes is that we don't wanted to be mean to us student but we just don't wanted any cheating on test. I once read this article about this student who had big dreams and was going to try to change the world but one day she got wrote up for cheating on a test by texting this other student with the answer to that test. Of course she didn't get any point but not the way to start off trying to save the world and making it a different places.

In my perspective as a student I honestly like policy one better because I use my phone a lot out of school.

I support policy one because I would like to be able to use my phone during lunch and text others who are on the other side of the room, instead of walking over there.

This is also another good policy because sometimes the duty aids will make us go back to our seat even if we just wanted to ask a quick question.

I believe they would like policy two better, because how I also said earlier, some of the students don't even follow most of rules at school, especially the current cell phone policy.

I think the staff would probably end up taking more cell phones if they established policy one because students wouldn't turn their cell phones off because they were just currently using and they didn't have enough time before class to turn it off, or they forgot.

Principal,

Cell phones in schools has been a controversial policy since cell phones became widely used by today's youth. Cell phones should be allowed in school during breaks and free time for the following reasons: students would be able to call for help during an emergency, students would be less likely to use them in class, and because there is no logical reason in not allowing them.

Imagine this scenario: an unknown and man walks into a classroom holding a firearm and says that anybody who yells will be killed. Students with out cell phones available would be unable to call for help in anyway. If the students had cell pones they would be able to quickly text there parents or another trusted person about the situation and ask them to call the police. Cell phones would greatly help averting a possible tragedy like this.

If students were allowed to use cell phones during lunch or passing periods they would be much less likely to do so in class. This is because the majority of students who use phones during class are sending short messages reminding another person of something or are sending messages to their parents telling them to pick them up because they are sick. These messages are usually not very urgent so most students would be glad to wait a few minutes until class is over if it meant they had no risk of getting in trouble.

The most important reason for allowing cell phones in school while students are at lunch or passing period is because there is no logical reason not to allow it. Students would not be able to cheat on tests if they could not use them during class. Although they could ask a student who already took the test what the questions were like they could also just as easily ask them in person.

There is absolutely no benefit to banning cell phones outside of class.

In conclusion students should be allowed to use cell phones during breaks because it could help students reach police during a tragedy, they would be less likely to use phones during class, and there is no reason that students should not be allowed to.

Although this has been a controversial topic for years, this is easily the most logical rule regarding cell phones in school and should be used immediately.

I believe that you should allow students to bring their phones and use them during lunch periods and other free times. It is a much better policy that not allowing phones at all. Not allowing phones at all is bad idea because the students need their phones to contact their parents or anyone else. They need their phones in case of emergencies. The students will be very upset if you follow through with the no phones at all rule. The students would be much happier if you would allow them to use their phones during their free times. I think they would follow that rule way more then not being able to have their phones at all. Like I said before, the students need their phones in case of emergencies. What if something happens at home and their families can't get a hold of them? That would be a problem.

I agree with policy 1 for certain reasons. I would consider my principal to agrre with police 1. I would like to be able to use phones during certain periods. Some periods I would like to use my phone at are homerooms, lunch, and other free times. I will also like to use them so I would not be bored. Also, so if were using them during school we would not get it taken away from are teachers. One reason why I would like to be able to use the phones in school is so I would not be bored. Yes, we would only be allowed to use them during are lunch period and other free times. But, with one condition, not use them during class time. But otherwise we could bring them to school. There are students in the building who use them during class time and I do that at times is either because we bored, We now what the teacher is talking about , and because is something interesting. Some other reason, is because we like to take pictures with are friends, or are selfs. This is why I agree with policy 1.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
EAC3596461E7,"Dear Principal,

Out of the two possible policies you are considering I would have to say that i favor the second. The idea of allowing students to use cell phones during free time makes absolute sense. Not allowing the phones during class time is respectable as well, that way the learning isn't affected.

During free time, students aren't putting their time into anything anyway. Letting them use their phones will have no affect what so ever or anything important, such as school work. There is really no downside to policy number one. It will make most students very pleased as well.

Policy two however, I am against. The idea of no phones what so ever seems harsh and strict. What is the student is having a bad day and can't call a parents for a little help? That could affect how the learn in school, not being able to have outside connections. It would be like the student was in a cage for an entire school day, how would you feel to be locked up in a cage? The student's should be allowed their freedom.

There is always a punishment for not following the rules, some will have to be thought of, of course, if the new policy that you choose is not followed. Don't expect everything to run smooth at first, things may always be changed. Try out letting students use the phones during free time, it's just something new. It may lead to a happier environment, and maybe even better grades for students. Young people love freedom and being allowed to do what they want, giving them this freedom could have a tremendous outcome. I am sure that you have many other things to think about, so, with that I give you, thank you and goodbye.

Sincerely,

A student with a voice.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I think that the students should be allowed to use there cell phones during free time. It is not like they are going to cheat on a test because they are at lunch. But i also think that they really don't need them unless they have to text there parents. They really don't need them because they are at school with all of there friends so who do they need to text because all there friends are with them. before the students go into class they should have to drop their phones into a bin so they do not get tempted to text during class. When they have free time they should be able to use them because after all it is free time. They should also be able to use them at lunch because they might need to text there parents or a friend to tell them what time to pick them up or to bring them lunch because they forgot theirs. The second rule about not letting students have a cell phone at school at all is a bad idea to me. They should be able to use there phone because they might need them and they are the same as going on a computer at lunch because you can still email people and go on the internet. So why should you not be able to use cell phones if you can use computers. I think that you should pass the first policy instead of the second because all the students would enjoy being able to use them at lunch.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
BAD78C43D291,"Dear Principal,

I was informed that you have two choices about cell phone policy. I have read both and I have came to the conclusion you should chose policy 1.

Policy 1 is the better choice. Policy 1 gives permission to students to be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch periods but not in class time. Students need to be able to have their cell phones because maybe they need to call for a ride after school. If there is a fight and someone is hurt they can call the ambulance with their cell phones. Going to the office for a phone would take to long if the kid is seriously injured. Phones are a way communication we really are not doing anything wrong by having them. This is why policy one is the better choice.

Policy 2 states to not allow students to have cell phones at school at all. This is not a good choice because if this happens then students will be angered and sneak phones in anyways. Students will be using them in class because the teachers will not be able to see. You might say that kids will use their phones in class with policy 2 but if they have time to use their phones during passing periods then there will be no reason for them to use it in class. This is why policy 2 is the wrong choice.

RINNNGG!! Many people consider cell phones to be a distraction in school, and so they make rules against them in school. Cell phones aren't a distraction as long as they are on silent or not in use during school time. Students should have the opportunity to use cell phones during their lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. There is no problem with this because it will not disturb anybody from their education and still let them enjoy their school day a little more. There is noting wrong with providing students with some fun on their boring and school days. This will make the students enjoy school a little more, and they will be more eager to learn after they had their day of fun.

Cell phones should have a chance to be used during free times. Students usually are not eager to learn because they are bored, or they are tired of all the studying they did so far. Cell phones will bring a little fun into the students' school day, and so they wouldn't mind learning after having a little fun at lunch or their other free times. It will benefit the school by letting them educate their children better and make their students receive a higher grade than usual. Using cell phones during their free time will increase their grade. This fact has been proven because over 70% of the students grade in a school increased just by letting them use cell phones. Increased student grades will make the parents happy, the word would spread, and the school will get more students to join their school

The use of cell phones will also make a lot of kids happy. The students would be more eager to attend school than normal. Once students start liking the school, they will try more and they will tell their peers about how great their school is. Their peers will mention this to their parents and the parents would let their child join the school. Therefore, letting the use of cell phones in school can benefit the school greatly with no loss. The students would be happy, the parents would be happy, and the school would be happy. So, letting students use cell phones ONLY during their free time would benefit everybody greatly and make everybody happy.

Many people would say that the use of cell phones is hazardous for a school. But, the cell phones wouldn't be hazardous if the school makes rules on the activities done on the cell phone. They should make rules such as, ""Only text or call the people you know"" and ""No violating other school rules"". This should keep everybody safe and happy in the school. If any serious issue pops up due to the use of cell phones, then there is no problem with banning the use of cell phones later. Students probably would want to keep their privileges, and so they probably will keep themselves from doing something that will take their fun away. The school should say that they are serious, and this will keep the students of the edge of their chairs, and make them scared.

The use of cell phones could possibly not cause any bad things in school. It will make everybody happy, including the school, parents and students. What is wrong with a little fun in the days of the hard working children? Cell phones should only be used during the students' lunch period or their free time. If anybody is caught with using cell phones during their class time, then there is nothing wrong with these extraordinary privileges to be taken away. I hope you would consider the choice of letting students use their cell phones during their free time to provide a school day with enjoyment.

The policy you should choose is number 1, i think its the best. Every kid or teen that go to school needs to bring there phone. Here are some reasons what if some kids were stuck outside in the rain and they got sick because you wouldn't let them bring there phone. Im not saying its your fault, but there parents might be ticked off at you. Another reason is , what if there was a kid about to get in a fight and they didn't want to. If they had there phones the kid could of called is mom or dad whoever to pick him or her up and it would of been over. No you didn't allow them to bring their phones so know that kid is walking home with two black eyes, and one bloody nose, because you wouldn't allow them to bring there phones. How do you think he's going to explain that to there mom or dad. "" Yea mom i was walking home from school and i ran into a pole."" T

I also like policy 2, but not more than 1. The reason why is students always text during class when there not suppose to. If there texting in class that can lead them to not knowing the information. Another reason is threats and fights, we all know that stuff is dangerous and you can prevent it more, by not letting students bring there phone to school.

Hi, I am a teenage girl named STUDENT_NAME that goes to SCHOOL_NAME, and my principal named TEACHER_NAME, is allowing the students to have their cell phones at school.

There is only one place that they can not have them, during class.

She would always catch some of my friends during class using their cell phones and would give them detentions, so the kids made a riot against her.

TEACHER_NAME does not want to be uncool and banish the cell phones, so she is being nice, and letting them use them out side of class.

Ever since she enhanced that rule, the student have been ignoring each other and starting fights because they want to use each other's cell phones.

Luckily, I don't have a phone, or friends.

Policy 2:

Hey, it's me again, STUDENT_NAME, and my Principal took the cell phone rule away.

The students are being rude to her and asking things like, "" why can't we have our cell phones during class if we can have them at lunch?""

We'll that's why I'm going to send her a letter give her my opinion on the rule.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand your concern on the cell phones rule, and I would like to inform you that I agree with you.

This is a high school and the students, including me, should not be allowed to use cell phones during any time in school.

If, some how, all the students will hate you after this decision, it's better for them because they will get an education and grow up to be strong and smart, but if they do actually hate you, you should be proud of yourself because you are creating smart teenagers all by yourself. Thank you for reading my letter about the cell phone rules.

AB4F9B52DF71,"Bring cell phones to school is not a good idea. Students are already bring their cell phone to school and they don't need to. Students get caught texting in class all the time. Cell phones are a major distraction. Do not allow this.

Many students get their cell phone took almost everyday. Teacher be trying to teach their lesson but they can't because students are using their cell phone in the middle of class. This idea is bad because when students need to be learning something they are not. This shouldn't even be a thought because you should know even if you do allow this and they are suppose to turn them off during class, they are not going to. This wouldn't be fair to the teachers or the students because the students aren't learning anything and they teachers are not do their jods=

Students are distracted by almost everything. Most students don't even listen to the teacher and them bring their cell phones wont be any better. they can find many things to do during lunch and their free time other than text or call people during school.

I believe Policy 2 would be a better decision. I think it would be a better decision because then students would not be distracted my phone calls and text messages. Choosing Policy 2 may also increase a students ability in school. They may test higher and have better grades. Also, students can get a better job due to their grades.

Students may be distracted by phone calls and text messages because they may not turn off their phone or they bring it to school in the first place. The students may even have their phone on ring which may distract their fellow class mates or even the teacher.

Students also may be distracted from their phones when it comes time for learning. If we take phones out completely the students may get better grades and test higher. They can even get into a better college than what they would have if they were on their phones all the time. That leads to a good job to support their lives and, if they have a family, their families lives.

They may not be aware of this, partly because they may be on their phones, but they can get better jobs if they stay off their phones and on the books. They would not only get better jobs but they even can be paid more than what they would have if they wouldn't have gotten better grades.

The consequences should be very big for being on a cell phone or let alone bringing a cell phone to school. Students should at least have a detention or even an in school suspension. Students need to know their boundaries and what happens when they cross them. Discipline is a great way to turn students off their cell phones.

Cell phones are huge distractions in school. They lead to high school drop outs because of their grades and, not to mention, they lead to low income. If we let students use cell phones more in school they may get the thought they can do whatever they want. We need to put a stop to this now so our future generations will be able to support their families.

Students should be able to brig their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I understand that you may conceder the opposite idea , but you should be able to trust your students. As they get older and older even if phones were to be prohibited, it wouldn't work anyways. Our school is a democracy.

Your students and my classmates should have the choice of weather they desire to carry and use there property on their own time. You should have enough trust in them to believe that during the time that they are luring to become successful they will not use there cell phones in class. If they would decide to go against this policy, the teacher should just be able to take the students phone away either until the end of the day or until the end of class. If you school is such a democracy then the students should have a word on what you decide.

Also , if propitiation hasn't worked in your experience, then it probably won't work in the future either. When the people that make up your school are all deceiving a rule it is usually because they will take the risk to get what they want. There are too many students that are using there phones during free time anyways to have it become a rule to not use them. Not allowing students to use their phones on their own time would be overly dramatic and would not make much of a change.

Lastly, students also need to be able to have some type of communication with their friends and family. If they wouldn't have this, many of them would probably be in a bad mood or just think about other situations while they are supposed to be learning in class. Having their cell phone during free hours is a way for them to have a brake and just free their mind for the remaining time until class starts again. If phones were not aloud in this school then teenagers would have more anger bottled up and they would feel like they were having much longer and stressfully days then usual.

I understand why you would consider starting a new policy, but our students are trust worthy enough to have there phones during the day. If the policy of not being able to have there phones during school would be passed, then there would be much of a difference enyways. Students would still use there phones secretly. Lastly, students need to be able to have a brake between classes considering all the work they are doing to become successful. Prohibiting phones would be unusual and unfair to the students of our school.

I have heard that you are considering two new phone policies. Policy 1 is about letting us, the students, bring our phones to school and being able to use them at lunch and other free times. While Policy 2 is not letting us have our phones at all while at school. As a student myself I have to agree more with Policy 1. Letting us use our phones during lunch and other free times would let us communicate more with each other. During class most of what we think about is probably what we are going to say to our friends the next time we see them. Since we have no time to coordinate where to go for free time with our friends we might miss them. If we could use our phones to text them we could met up. A friend that is sick and missing classes might want to catch up on work so they don't get too far behind. The friend at school could call them at lunch or free time and tell them if anything important is going on. Along with telling them about school work, we wouldn't want them to get too bored, now would we? Our friends are how we get through the day. They are what makes us look at the white board and say ""I can get this. I can learn."" When we are lost their the ones who put us back on track and the ones who show us the way. If you allow us to use our phones outside of the classroom they can do all of these things from across the school and I'm sure that we would do much better inside the classroom. Phones are the way that we keep up our friendships with those that we never see. I have a friend that the only time I see her is if we happen to go to the same place for free time. Once in a while we will run into each other in the hall and say where to meet but only like once a month. All her classes are upstairs while mine are all downstairs and on the other side of the school. Can you guess the way we've staid in contact? Yep, that's right, cell phones! To some it may sound stupid and cheesy but cell phones are what keeps our lives together. Unless you would rather put all friends together in one classroom, I think the best way to go is Policy 1.

F8261D76CC4A,"I think that the principal should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

I think this because if students are using their phones during lunch and other free times they will not be bothering or disturbing anyone. Also students go from class to class without being able to talk yet they are surrounded by their friends. When students get a break they might want to be able to use their phones with out being restricted from socializing, in an even quieter non disturbant way, during their break as well.

Secondly i believe that the principal should let students have their phones during lunch or other free times because they can get the need to talk to someone out so during class they will be able to focus on what they are learning. If a student uses their phone at lunch or another free time they will not want to use it in class and will not have that distraction.

Thirdly, If a student does see nothing wrong or a problem with using their phone during a free time when it is not allowed, and gets it taken away it can cause the student to not have contact with their parents after school. Students rely on parents or guardians to pick them up after school and if they don't have a phone they will not be able to contact a parent. Also students pay a lot of money for their phones and if taken away is not fair.

Lastly, student may have assigned seats during their lunch time and cannot freely talk to their friends. If a student is able to use their phone they will be able to tell their friend what they would like without making any noise or bothering anyone.

In conclusion i think that the principal should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off in class. You will be able to talk to someone with out bothering anyone, will not cause a distraction in class because you have already texted or talked to someone, and kids who have assigned lunch seats will be able to talk to their friends without making a lot of noise.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Cell phones are one of the most essential elements in anybody's life. In a high school student, the cell phone is essentially important. I agree that cell phones are a distraction in class, but I see no particular reason for banning cell phones in lunch periods, when it is a social time for the students to kick back and relax, or answering to an emergency, and if using cell phones is their way of relaxing than I see no reason of banning them completely.

The cell phone is used for calling and messaging. Sure, most of the calls are related to social issues, but there is also a chance their could be an emergency in tact. What if a loved one was in a car crash, or brutally hurt or ill? The school phone simply isn't useful in positions like this when something personal is supposed to be passed on. And if in free times and lunch, the phone is banned, there is simply no way to pass on the message in a dignified manner, and you will be the reason to blame if you don't choose banning cell phones only in class.

The high school student's social life is the essence and foundation to a healthy and successful high school career. But the cell phone is the entrance to many student's social lives. Do you want a student to transverse into a depression, because he doesn't have the time to use the phone because of homework after school, and now in school? Do you want him to commit suicide? All you have to do to prevent that is choose Policy number one.

If those reasons are what you're looking for, then I don't know what reasons you're looking for. To give a student a social life, to keep their life personal, or to prevent them from hanging themselves, just choose policy number one. That is what I would do if I were you, ma'am.

FC32A69615FF,"I believe that policy one is the best one to go with. Policy one still restricts students from using their phone anytime they want be still gives them access to it. Also as long as the phones are off and not detracting anyone i think its perfectly fine.

Why i believe its ok for students to have their phone at school? I believe students should be able to use their phones because as long as its off it shouldn't matter. Also being able to use it during a certain time of the school day is also a good thing for a student because they may not know if their parents may want them to ride the bus instead of being a car rider. For example if a student isn't allowed to use their phone during a certain time of the school day and their parents text them saying they have to ride the bus, but the student doesn't get it then what is the student going to do. Because now the student has no way home , and all of this could of been avoided if the student was allowed their phone during a certain time of the school day.

Now you know why i believe that the principle should go with policy one. Allowing the student to still have access to their so is important.

ADD7CE85B73C,"Students should be able to have cell phones at school because what harm is it doing to the child if they text during a passing period or during lunch? Its not hurting anybody as long as the phone is turned off and doesn't cause a distraction during class time then why would it be a problem?

I know that some teenagers will still try to text during class but the number of people who do will go down. The school should treat students and teachers fairly. If there trying to be fair then the teachers shouldn't be aloud to use there cell phones during class either. Cell phones aren't even that bad in the first place. Yes, most of Americans use them to much, and they are a huge distraction most of the time but they still haven't done any harm to the American society. Actually cell phones have actually brought a lot of people closer together. They also serve the purpose to help people out.

I understand there's not that great of a purpose to having a cell phone at school, but it would make the student body a whole lot happier than it is today. Just the short time we have during class would just be so much better for everybody in the entire school. I still don't even understand why we aren't aloud to use them during class. Why do the teachers care, there getting paid? If a student doesn't want to listen then they shouldn't be forced too. Kids go to school to get a education i understand it shouldn't be interrupted by cell phones. but kids need to have a good time well learning.

26557C3672F2,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a middle school student, I believe that policy 1 is perfectly efficient and makes more sense. Kids need their phones for obvious reasons; who will pick them up, what do they do after school. Their phones help them connect with their parents or guardians.

I'm a student, and I own a cell phone. The only time I need to use my cell phone is after school waiting to get picked up. Every now and again I will need to call my mom during class, but I always ask first. Most kids don't even bring phones at all. A few text during class, though it doesn't last long. But banning phones altogether is unrealistic, and unreasonable. Some kids rely on them to get home. If something happens, contact with parents is essential.

If phones were banned altogether, I think many kids would lose lots of freedom. Parents trust their kids more if they have a way to get in contact with them. Without their phone, kids could be left at school, locked out of the house, or stuck somewhere off campus, and parents have no idea where they are. If someone goes somewhere after school with friends, parents feel more comfortable if their kid has a phone, and if they don't the student may be kept at home by parents. In other words the ban of phones could cut into social life, and reducing stress.

What is the harm in policy 1? I see it that there is no harm done. The students can't disrupt class by using phones during class, so what's the problem? They can call parents or guardians at opportune times like lunch and other breaks. This lets them stay in contact with home, keep parents more comfortable, and keep classes in order with no electronic cell phone disruption.

I think that you should let students have their cell phones to school and let them use them during free time and lunch periods. My first reason is if students are do with all their work they should be able to text because if we don't let them they are going to be talking to other people and disturbing the people that are still trying to work, so when we let them they wont disturb the their other classmates. They will also get into less trouble when they don't have anything to do.

Normally they the people that get into trouble in the class room is people that have nothing to do. We can decrease that number by letting them text. Also when we do this less people in the office, more time for the secretaries to do what they need to do.

I hear that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy due to complaints within the school. I believe that students should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and free times as long as they are off during class because it will give students a greater sense of freedom and they aren't really causing any trouble outside of class time.

To begin with, I think we as students should be allowed to use cell phones during time out of class because it would give us a greater sense of freedom. Often times, we don't have lunch with our friends or even people that we know. And since we're not allowed to move lunch tables or classes during free time, we should be able to talk to our friends. I'm not going to lie and say we don't already use them during these times, but one of the reasons we use them is because they are banned. When students think they aren't given enough freedom, we often do exactly what we're not supposed to do. If we were allowed to have them during school, then we would be less likely to abuse the use of cell phones in school. Socialization is a key component to how we will grow and survive in life. If we don't have the ability to talk to people, then how can we be expected to continue growing and maturing? With the help of a new cell phone policy, our generation could grow socially and help make a very unconnected society connect on a more personal level.

Secondly, I believe students should be allowed to have phones during school as long as they're off during class because outside of the classroom, they really aren't doing any harm. If you think back, the reason cell phones were originally banned from school was because kids were using them to cheat on tests and class work. So why do they need to be banned during free time and lunch? I, personally, don't really think they do. It's not like we can cheat on what we're going to eat for lunch or what book we're reading. So let us use ours phones in the time that's given to us specifically every day so we have a break in our schedules. With the new policy, students still wouldn't be allowed to cheat, but we'd also be allowed to talk to our friends.

In conclusion, I believe students should be allowed to use their phones during lunch and free time as long as they're off during class. For one thing, it will give us a greater sense of freedom. Plus, they're not really doing any harm outside of class. so please consider changing the cell phone policy to policy one.

I think that we should be able to bring our phones to school, because some of us may have sick family members or may be sick ourselves. If so then if we are to get sick at school then we may not have a way to contact our parents or legal guardians. or if one of our family members become ill then how will we know unless we are contacted by you or the secretary, and sometimes we just might like to know right very first. For example what if our Grandma had a heart attack and we had no way of knowing?? Or if we need to be some where after school and we can't get to the office phone before the school closes then we may need our phones.

But on the other hand I' am kind of against it myself because I have seem many school fights over kids who have cell phones and who don't. It's either the children with phones picking on the children without phones who are to ""poor"" maybe its just that their parents don't want them to have them. Or it's the children without cell phones picking on the ""preps"" for having phones or jumping them to get a-hold of their phones. Also most of the time if you tell a student that they are allowed to bring their phones to school they will more in likely turn them on while you are out of the room or even while your teaching. If you were to give them the privilege of using their phones during lunch and eight period what would that mean could we talk and text or just text? Because that may cause other students to slowly get louder and louder as the time grows on. Also by the meaning of using our phones during school do you mean that we are just allowed to talk and text or are we allowed to get on the internet? Listen to music off of our ring tones? You have to ask yourself this would it cause an even bigger disruption? Plus what are you meaning when you say free time when yall are done teaching?

AE47AB399CF4,"If my principal was reconsidering the cell phone policy, my answer would be to not allow them.

What would you do if you were in this situation?

Hopefully, you would say ""NO cell phones allowed in school.""

In result of cell phones allowed, would be kids not learning anything because they were on their cell phone.

The principal should not let students use they cell phones because they would get out of hand with it and start using them everywhere, even in the classroom.

Another reason is students would be talking on the phone and texting which will be disturbing to the other classes that are present when their in the library or lunch.

If the principal lets the students bring cell phones with them to school and let them use it, it's like the principal does not like his/her job or is just lazy.

Another thing that would happen if cell phones were allowed would be teachers seeing students grades falling from A' s to B' s or C' s to D' s.

If that started happening the parents would start getting interested with what's happening with their grades.

The parent would probably go to the school and complain about their son/daughters grades falling.

The principals response would not be anything, the real answer is that he/she allowed cell phones in school.

That is what i would think would happen if cell phones were allowed.

The principals choice should be ""NO, cell phones allowed at all on school property unless after school hours.""

If this wasn't the choice, like i said before it would be like fun time all the time for the students.

It wouldn't even be like school.

That is why no cell phones should be allowed on school property.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Cell phones are a big part of a child's life. Cell phones can help you thru a lot. Cell phones can be helpful or hinder you during school. I am here to help you choose one of the following polices that you are considering. I am going to tell you the positive and negative effects of policy one and two.

Policy One:

Positive: Students need to have there phones with them at all times for emergency purposes. They need to be able to come in contact with their parent or guardian. During free periods they should be allowed to talk to peers because it is their free time and should be allowed to associate with each other in a manner that they like.

Negative: Some students would try to abuse this power so it would be best to have some type of limitation to this policy. During class time if you are caught with your cell phone out I think the student should be given a warning. It would be ok for a teacher to take the phone away if a warning has already been administered to the student unless the phone was off. If the phone was out and it was sited out then i think it should not be taken but to just tell the student to put it away.

Policy Two:

Positive: T",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
4F7F5784717B,"I think policy two would be a better choice for students because if you allow the usage of cell phones then some kids might take advantage of it. If students were allowed to have cell phones during school they would be distracted and would not focus on their schoolwork.

Even though the plan is to allow cell phones during school but not during classes, students will be unruly and take advantage of the opportunity by using their cell phones during class while the teacher is not looking.

If you do not allow cell phones in school and you enforce it then there might not be any problems with the usage of cell phones and students would be able to focus on their school work. That is why I think policy number two would be a better choice for schools.

If the students get the experience of having cell phones in the classrooms then they might not take advantage of it. But you can not be sure of that. Some students can act spoiled and use ell phones for wrong purposes.

Some students could communicate with each other doing bad things. For example some would use it o make a bomb threat, or send something inappropriate to another student. Some kids might also use their cell phones for not only bomb threats but also regular threats that might cause harm to another student. And you nor the deputy of the school would know about it. Unless they start to act suspicious.

It is just like the book if you give a mouse a cookie, they will either take advantage of it or they will use i for wrong purposes, or they might even want more or something else. Cell phones can lead to more fights and possibly more failures.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I believe that the 1st policy will be good for are school. The reasons for this is that students may need to call home is they forgot something or just time to talk to other friends that don't go to there school. Lunch is a time to relax and talk about what has happened during the 1st part of school and time to talk to people that don't go to their school, and kids that are very stressed about school and can just relax and talk to other people. If there is a case where a student is being miss treated and they feel unwelcome by their classmates and they can call to talk to someone. Maybe the kids that go to school don't have any friends at school so they can call people that make them fell better than the kids at their school. I feel that sometimes having a cell phone is like a protector it makes the kids fell save when they have it with them. Yes, i think that putting away after lunch and free time and turning them of so that it doesn't temp them to text someone or them. This is a good thing so that the kids don't get distracted with it, so that it will not effect their ability to learn during the class time. I hope you take to heart at what I have said. I feel that all students should have all the rights to have their phones with during free time and at lunch with them. Some kids need their phones to make them feel good about themselves, the ones that are shy, and don't really fit in at the school. Well I have to get back to class, have a great day.

0EF272634FEE,"my suggestion would be you are allowed to use the cell phones in school because it would be better cause it gets boring in school and we be able to have are phone on us all times and on cause really what if there was something wrong to your family you might want to know. and again we could use them in the halls and things like that and we don't have to get in trouble for having on cause everyone knows everyone brings a phone into school and you get in trouble and your mom has to come in the school and get it from a the teacher and that's a little regulus.

It would be a good idea for phones to be allowed phones in free time and lunch and not class cause it would distracted you in class. I think we might be able just to text because if you distracted kids you will be in trouble and it want be a distraction if we all text and put it on vibrate so no one can hear the phone but just see it being use and don't have to hear any body's voice or anything.

It would help the teachers waste there time busting kid for phones in there pockets or kids texting under neath the desk trying to cover it the want have to waste there times after school for just a phone but one they have a and the text and if they get to use there phones we get to its not fare leasing to there phones going off in class. all so its a waste of the schools time just for having that as a rule no phones in school its point less cause you know and we know that your are not going to stop us for bring are phone to school.

so regardless if you still don't want us to have phones in school we are going to everyday all day until schools over so u can let us not have phones in school or u can think about wasting all the teachers times or let us bring are phones to school. they might just want to worry about kids and there studies and not care for a phones and care about all the fighting and all the kids making front of each other.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
EF62C29BE292,"Dear Principle,

I believe that you should choose policy one. If kids can use there phone in a responsible way then i think they can be used during free periods. However if you notice that phones aren't being used at the right time or in the right way i think you should take away the phones.

The reason I strongly believe that kids should have there phones in school is because they could need them during the day, to get in touch with their parents. For example if an after school activity gets cancelled and at lunch they want to let their parents know about it they have a chance to contact them. Furthermore students have an opportunity to talk to kids as long as they are both in a free period. Lastly what if during a free period your mom or dad texts you and says ""I cannot get you after school today and you'll need to get a ride home after school. ""

That gives you a chance to text your neighbor or a friend and ask if they can bring you home instead of taking the bus.

Personally policy two isn't fair to me. If kids can't take there phones to school then it could cause problems after school. For example, if you are to go to your friends house after school and the school didn't allow you to have your phone on or with you then they might have gotten sick or for some reason couldn't have you over then there would be an issue.

I hope that you understand my reasonings and will vote for policy one. Thanks for listening to me.

You letting us use our phones can be one of the best things you can do. Mostly because how many kids do you think get sent down to your office because the got caught using their phone during class? 20,25, or about 10 students a day is the answer. How many minutes do you waste lecturing them about why it is wrong and then you give them a referral? i would estimate around 5 minutes for each one that would mean you have just wasted more than 1 hours a day just lecturing them about using their phones. that's a lot of time being wasted. Now for you this is time that could have been used to do your work or file papers. Know image yourself that you didn't have that problem you would finish your work early, focus on other things you had in mind and maybe finish work that was due next week . Now that would mean more work time, more you time, and of course more relaxation.

Even though you say that it's still going to be bad and out of control well your wrong because when young adults have the time to themselves using their phones and sending texts during their free time ,why would they need to talk to someone later? In my opinion i know that giving us the time to use our cell phones would mean that kids have a better time at school, meaning they would want to come back.

Principle if you don't do this you are probably going to have to work overtime at the office , you would have to do your work that was do yesterday today just because of this phone policy of yours. Now Principle i think the right thing to do would be to go with policy #1.

Image you are in a classroom and an emergency occurs, and there is no one else to help you, what do you do? This is why cell phones are important to have at school. I am writing this letter to explain the importance of cell phones at school. I hope you take time out of your busy day to read my letter and take it into consideration.

First off, cell phones are not cheap. students also treat them like it is there child. would go nowhere without them. This information, I feel can teach good parenting skill for later on in life. students should keep them off in school, but they should be able to care them around like little children they will be able to have once they reach adulthood

Secondly, cell phones are a great way to communicate. This is a great way for students to communicate with other students all over the school. This would help students with studying and would make sure that no student is left out by his or her self. cell phones can be a great boost to self-esteem all over the school. This would reduce the amount of bullying and would give kids a real chance to make good life friends.

Lastly, if a emergency where to happen to a student at school. Other kids would be able to call for held if needed and would even save a kids life.

If a student would have a cell phone without emergency contact number, then they should not even be aloud to have a cell phone in the first place. So say one of your kids had an accident at school wound' t you want the to contact you.

I thank you for taking time out of your bust schedule to come and read my letter. I hope this will change your way of thinking about cell phones in school, and i hope you go with the first policy of cell phones.

I strongly believe that cell phones should be permitted at school . We should be aloud to use them during lunch periods and other free times we have as long as they are off during the class period. This is why i believe cell phones should be allowed at school.

Lots of students need their cell phones during the school day. For example, there might be an emergency going on and the student needs to call a parent. If cell phones were not permitted they might not be able to contact their parent and they could be in a lot of trouble. Also by having a cell phone with them it would be much easier to step outside of the classroom to contact someone instead of having to use the office phone or the teachers phone. Cell phones are great to have at school because lots of students at school need them through out the school day and if they didn't have them it might make their day a lot more complicated and stressful. Although you may think that if phones are allowed at school, students might be texting during class, you can make sure that all phones are off during the class period and may be turned on when the class period is over. If a student is caught disobeying the rules their phone should be taken away and given back at the end of the day.

In conclusion, please read this carefully and put in lots of thought to my ideas that we should be aloud to have our cell phones at school as long as there are rules to go along with that policy. Are students here at school are very responsible and I know that if we have this rule it can make our day here at school better for everyone!",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Students may bring there phones to school but they could only use them while there in lunch or any free time. Phones need to be turned off while in class or in the library if not they might get there phone taken away and they need to pick it up at the end of the day. Student's phones must be in their backpacks or in their pockets during class.

On, this policy by having phones at school the students should just leave their phones at home so it wont be taken by the teacher or so you wont loose it at school or other students wont have to rob you. So that's why students should really leave there phones at home. Another thing why students should not bring their phones to school at all it might fall and brake when you walk or if your texting you might bump into each other

I am writing to you to talk about the cell phone plan.

I think we should allow cell phones during lunch periods and other free times.

Having a phone around during lunch or free time isn't going to hurt anything. Teachers don't let us go to the office or use their classroom phone whenever we need them for something important, so we might as well be aloud to use our phones.

I think if you gave us students an opportunity to use there phones during lunch teachers wouldn't have to catch us in the classroom using them, because we would've already had our lunch or ""free time"" to use them, so we wouldn't need to anymore.

This probably sounds pretty risky but i have a few reasons on why this should be aloud.

My first reason is sometimes i forget stuff at home such as lunch or homework.

When i forget homework at home the teachers always go ballistic! but whenever i ask to go call my mom or dad to fix the problem and get my homework they say no, because we're in the middle of class.

My second reason is I like talking or texting my mom sometime in the day.

It always makes her happy when i send her a message saying I Love You Mommy or seeing how her day has been going so far.

My third reason is I have a phone.

My parents bought me a phone to use when i needed them and if I'm at school when I need them or they need me we cant get in touch because the teacher will take my phone. Once my mom had to call the front office just to ask me if she had turned the coffee pot off this morning when she could've just text me.

Another problem I have with the phone issue is the teacher taking your phone and storing it.

All they have to do is hold it for a few hours until the end of class but no they have to keep it for like 30 days until your parents comes to the school and gets it. We wouldn't have that problem if we could just use them.

I know you're are a busy principal and I'm just a student that you don't have to listen to, but I would really like for you to take this into some serious consideration.

I know that us students would really appreciate this it would be one of the best things you could do for our student body, and it's just about 30 minutes with your phone, you might even like to use yours.

I believe that policy 1 is better because You should allow students to bring cell phone, and allow them to use it during our free times and during lunch. We can have them off during our class time, so it wouldn't be a distraction. We would use our time wisely for class and when we are done with our free time and/or lunch we would turn them off, and head straight to class. Another reason why students well say to allow cell phones so if something is wrong they can right away text there parents or if there is something wrong and the parents contact them, on our free time we can check our phone and respond to our parents.

If you allow students to have there phones out during free time that well probably stop us from having them out during class. Because when we already did what we wanted on our phone than students wouldn't want to use it again. Our phones would be useful for things like our phone can go on the internet and with our work in class we need research so we can do researching on our phone. When we have math problems we can use our calculator on the phone to help us with our math problem.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Dear, Principle

Your rules in our school is that we cant use any cell phone at all. All students need to use their cell phone just in case of an emergency. You should really allow that to happen because it is unfair to us that we cant use them and i will tell you why. At least let us use it during free periods.

We should be allowed to use our cell phones because what if we have an emergency at home but we wont me able to find out until we go home to know something had happened to our family. We that's very impossible for us.

Kids can't live without their phones and we can keep track with our work because we wont b bored doing all work and no taking breaks. At least let us have a break because that isn't fair for us that we have to sit in the class all day until school is over. We need this opportunity to have a fun day in school and learn at the same time.

As you can see, my point of view is to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. The reason being is because its out free time to play but we don't have enough fun because we would like to talk on our phones and text people you miss talking to. Its just not fair.

I have heard of your two choices that you have established about the rules of cell phones at our school. I think you should choose to allow your students to use cell phones during free time and lunch periods. I think that it isn't doing the school any harm and is a reasonable suggestion. Cell phones may be needed during lunch because sometimes i forget my lunch at home and have to call my parents to drop it off, this may happen to other students as well. They also may be needed during school when students need to be picked up, if there feeling sick or have somewhere else important to be. I can think of many times when i needed to use my cell phone at school , so if you take away cell phone usage at school, it might just lead up to other serious uprisings with the students here.

I really appreciate all that you have done for our wonderful school. I have learned that you are considering a new cell phone policy for our school. I highly believe that you should consider Policy 1, which allows us students to bring our cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as our phones are turned off during class time.

One reason I believe you should make this our school policy is that sometimes we have an emergency and need to call home. I understand that we can ask permission and call home from a school phone, but sometimes it is about something personal and we are embarrassed to be talking in front of other people about it. We should be able to talk in private, if we need to, to our parents or guardians.

I realize this could be a problem because if other schools do not have this same policy, then kids at this school could be tempted to call or text their friends from other schools. That would be something that would be hard to control but if they really wanted to keep this policy going they would obey the rules. If the other schools do not complain about kids at that school having their cell phones out too much after we switched our policy than you will have to switch it back.

In conclusion, I hope you really consider Policy 1. It would make many of us happy and we would really benefit some of us. Thank you for taking your time in reading my letter and I will be waiting to hear your response.

If students use their phones in class then they don't pay much attention to their teachers. Students should know they can't use their cell phones in class.

I think students need to have their phones at school for example, in case of an emergency. Sometimes they need to contact someone to know when their leaving or going home. Without cell phones parents wouldn't know where their children are. Student sometimes need to make sure they can go over a friends house or just to let them know when they will be going home. If we use our phones on break then it wouldn't a disturbance to anyone. They can check the time or maybe just remind themselves of something they needed to do. On the other hand, having a phone in school isn't really a big deal.

If students have phones in class and they are turned on then it will distract them . I think as long as the teacher is strict about having phones turned on in class then students wouldn't use them. If students know the rule about cell phones then they wouldn't use them unless their bored in their class and want something to do.

I think you should let kids have cell phones in school, because what if one of our parents wants us to come home because something happened to them, and their hurt and your the only person close to the house. Or your parent needs to tell you something about your school work and you won't know about it till you get home then you get into trouble because they were really important, and that was your last day to turn it in. Also it will help kids interact in different ways, and kids won't get yelled at so much for talking because they can text instead. With phones in school kids can take notes and won't run out of paper and have to disrupt the class to get more. Also they can help teachers see if someone's cheating because they can check their phone and see their texts. Then you'll get both kids who were cheating and the punishment will be fair. Also when they forget to write a note for one class one of their friends can text them what it was and they'll get full credit for what they needed to do.

I've heard that you have 2 new cell phone policies in mind for the school. One policy say that you will allow the students to use our phone only during our lunch time and the other is that the students anot allowed to use them at all. In my opinion, I think policy number 2 would work out better then the 1st one because how will kids focus cause they'll use them during there class time. Second something can happened to the phone it can get damaged.

First, I'd say no one will follow the rule of policy number one because giving them the opportunity to at least use the phones during lunch time, they'll take advantage of it by using it in class texting each other back and forth. If students get caught with the phone somewhere else other than lunch, they'd make up a lie. Maybe they'll say "" I was texting my dad or my mom"" which we'd know is one of the most common cell phone lies ever used. They may disobey the rule and text on the way to call or in class even, then the phone will be taken. Plus the students wouldn't be able to focus on their work if their to busy looking at their phones reading a text message from one of their friends most likely the ones 2 inches away from them. That's why there are so many schools that are C' s

D' s and F' s, because the students are to busy reading a text message and not a book.

Also, what could anyone do if something happens to the phone or a situation happens involving a phone, what could you do then. Lets say a female student decides to send a young man some pictures of her self, then he sends it out to the school and then the young lady comes crying to you or another staff member, there's nothing what so ever we can do about it that was what she did that had nothing to do with the administration. Another situation can happen. lets say somebody lets another student hold their phone during school hours then all of a sudden the cell phone goes missing, out of no where. Then the cell phones owner bring their parent out to school and asks you to make the student give her the phone back. Again there's nothing you can do you didn't see what happened you have no real prof that the student gave the young lady the phone.

There are many reasons why you should use policy number 2 instead of one. Stuff happens that teenagers do but, you can't do anything about it. So any electric device shouldn't be allowed on the campus what so ever, if it is visible it'll be taken from whom ever has it not matter who's own it is. Also we want our kids to focus get their grades up some may have A' s and B' s but is it a high ""A"".

I recommend policy one to be allowed, to have use of cell phones only in lunch and free time periods because if student now don't have that privilege they are force to sneak texting. Not only are they sneaking texting but some students call parents and friends in bathrooms and locker room. So either way student are using there cellular devices anyway. It will also reduce the detentions and any other consequences that the school haves to make kids learn there lessons. So if you actually think about it you are teaching the kids more because there are no interruptions on taking away a cell phone or punishments there for there is more time on teaching then yelling punishing and interrupting in the class rooms environment. Also it is possible that the students behavior will increase because they have a little leeway. But if the policy dose not work you can just end up switching the rule to policy two and punishing the students that way and if you are nice enough if the students behavior changes then you can either give them another chance or say you blowed it so now you have to suffer with no cell phones what so ever.

I think you should consider allowing students to bring phone's to school and let them use them during lunch period's and other free times, just as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I think this because, wonder if it was an emergency? They're parents try calling the office but the secretary doesn't answer, so they text the child but the teacher's don't let them answer it or else the cell will be confiscated. But the parent need's to get a hold of them! What do they do? By not answering the parent could be risking something very big.

Also, if the kid wants to use they're cell phone to show his/her friend a really cool recording of his best friends band! Or if they want to call they're father that they never see or get to talk to, but school time is the only time he isn't at work so he can answer. What's the problem with that? There is no harm done whatsoever! Or, maybe they just want to take a picture of his friends to put on 'face book' or one of those shindig websites. I don't see what the problem is as long as it isn't done during class time. When the students walk into class, teacher's should check if the cell phone is off, just to prove that the kid isn't texting or playing games on his/her phone during the time that they are supposed to be learning.

I honestly don't understand what the problem is with having cell phones during lunch and free periods! I just don't get it! It's not like they could kill somebody with they're cell phone or create any harm. I understand how they aren't allowed to be on during class time, that's understandable. But not the fact that they cant have it on while they are not in class. In lunch time and other free periods, they aren't learning ,kids are usually hanging out with they're friends. There is no problem with using they're cell's while with friend's.

I think you should take this letter into consideration and consider allowing cell phone's to be used during lunch and free period's, but not during class.

I think that student are better off without cell phones in school at all because many student loose focus in learning the materials because they are more busy texting in classes. Another reason why school shouldn't allow the cell phones in school is many students leave their phones in their lockers and people steal them .

Many studies have shown that almost every student in the schools have cell phones and they concentrate more in texting in school rather learn their materials .Students are lacking in learning abilities by texting in classes and lose their focus and cause them to fail classes or passing the classes that are required to pass. Student are getting in trouble during classes by getting a consequence for being caught with a phone and cause them to lose a day of learning. In libraries that are suppose to help by a quiet environment so people can finish their homework or do something in a computer it's being abused by students .Using cell phones and texting disturbing other people concentration.

When cell phones are brought to school their are possibilities that it might be stolen by somebody .Student that leave their cell phones in their locker usually accuse others that they stole them and that bring arguments with students and teachers. False accusation can lead to many unwanted fight with a phone problem. Student take many chances to bring their phones to the school and the school doesn't want to be responsible that why we shouldn't bring cell phones to school to bring commotion to the school.

Schools shouldn't allow students bring cell phones to school because one little object can lead to many trouble and its suppose to help us and is hurting or way to think in school .

Students will still have a form of communication. Students will be able to communicate with parents in case of an emergency. Studies have shown that 92% of students use their cell phones to communicate with their parents in case of an emergency. When a student brings their cell phones to school, it allows them to consistently send update to their parent(s) or guardian.

A students survey has shown that students use their cell phones on a daily basis to let others , such as their parents or siblings, to inform them about surprise events at school. Students will feel more at ease with their cell phones. Ask any student why they should be allowed to have a cell phone at school. They will tell you because they feel more comfortable knowing that they have someone to call on with the push of a button.

Parents can benefit from the first policy as well. Not only will students feel more comfortable, parents will too! It makes them feel better to hear from their child that they are okay and that they are in a safe environment. Parents can pick up their child from school from after school events without the student having to wait for a long length of time.

Teachers will also benefit from policy 1 because they won't have to wait for a parent to come pick up their child after school. Teachers have lives outside of the school and waiting for a parent to come pick up their child is not part of it. So, really think about it. Policy 1 is the better choice, wouldn't you agree?

3997C6D12E37,"When students use their phones in class it could disrupt class. If students just used their phones at lunch or a break of some sort because it could be helpful in case they forgot something at home. The principal should let the students only use phones at breaks away from class.

An example of this is when students text on the phone in class and the teachers are teaching it could bother the whole class if a phone goes off. This shows that when teachers want to teach the students he or she is bothered by so many phones going off. When a student is texting it might corrupt learning for other students that actually want to learn.

Another reason that it should only be allowed on breaks is when students are taking a test and some student has their phone go off by another friend it makes it hard to concentrate on the test. This makes it hard to do anything with a phone going off in the middle of class. Students that use a phone during class should have to taken away, but when it is a break they should be allowed them.

One problem that comes up is when students are authorized that privilege they might abuse it and make fun of their teachers at school and not use it for getting something that they left at home. Teachers should watch students and make sure they are not doing anything wrong or abusing the privilege they have been given.

I believe that students should not use their phones in class, but use them for personal property that they forgot. It should be only allowed at breaks and not for classroom games. That is why cell phones should only be used in breaks only.

The student's phones should only used for breaks because it could disrupt class, they could text in class, but there is one problem to this though. They abuse their privilege and make it so the teachers want to take them away. That is why they should only be allowed on breaks.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Cell phones are a huge part of teens lives. Many have them and use them constantly. If teachers can use their cell phones students should be allowed to also. I think you should allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as their phones are turned off during class time.

Allowing students to use cell phones is a great idea for many reasons. First, students can increase their social life. Students can call and text their friends to make plans to get together or to have a study date. Also, students can use their cell phones to help them meet with others during study periods or to sit together at lunch. Many teens use their cell phones for emergency and not just to talk to their friends. Parents may need to arrange for their child to be picked up from school and have no way of getting in touch with them. Lastly, cell phones can help students with communication skills. Some teens are very shy, but talking on the phone can help them communicate and become more outgoing.

Finally, banning cell phones is simply unjust. Teachers get calls in the middle of class and are allowed to answer. Teachers should not even be able to have the ringer on their cell phones during class. Teachers should need to wait to lunch or a free period. Students should be able to have their cell phones and use them during free periods as well . After all that is time for the students to do what they want.

Thank you for listening to what

I have to say. I hope you can come to the right decision. Please take this into consideration when deciding the new cell phone policy.

I think that children should not be able to use a cell phone at all during school. If you allow them during free time then eventually they will try to run with their newly granted privileges and use them during class harming others learning environment.

Another problem is that school is supposed to be a place to learn not to socialize with your friends. The only thing a phone will do to kids at school is have negative affect on them.

Another reason that a no phone policy should be put in place is because phones do not help the students do anything but cheat and talk to their friends. Also if people are texting in between classes its not likely that they will stop their discussion just because their class started. In addition to that people may uses their phones to cheat on a test or get their homework answers from a friend. Again this is bad choice for the children of your school.

I hope you agree with me that their will be negative affects towards the students learning environment if you let them have new privileges that will let them cheat on tests, on their homework, and eventually in the long run themselves because they have bits and pieces missing out of their education that may eventually be helpful to them. Thank you for considering my opinion.

2B81FF610FB7,"To allow cell phones in school is like letting kids play games and school is not fun and games. One reason why cell phones should not be aloud in school is other schools might not allow cell phones so who are we going text or call and why would we just text a person that is only down the hall that we will be talking to in a few minutes at lunch. Another reason why cell phones should not be allowed in school is the halls and the lunch room would be really loud from all of the ring tones. That would be really annoying to the students in class. We come to school to learn and having cell phones around us is just distracting. Next thing you'll know students will start bringing ipods, portable gaming systems, and more. So, bringing cell phones to school doesn't help our education. It just distracts us because during class all you can think about is getting out of class to text your friend. I totally think letting kids bring cell phones to school is a bad idea.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Policy 2 is probably better because students text too much. Texting makes students dumber because they use short hand and spell things wrong during school. Students text during class and don't pay attention because they are too busy texting. I think it would be better if students leave their phones off in their locker.

Teachers want students to be better in school and become smart people, well then they have to do something about it. I think they should have policy 2 because students aren't going to do much if they're texting. The students could have their opinion and say that texting is important to them and they can't live without it well the truth is they would be better off without it. They would become smart, intelligent people because they would spell things right and they would pay attention more. All they concentrate on is their phones and nothing else.

When they call people they never want to hang up, so they focus on that and not school. If they couldn't use their phones then people would look at them different, like they were better people. Why do students think they can't live without a phone? It's because they get hooked to it like a lot of people do with a television, they can't put it down. Like me, most students are pretty much addicted to electronics. They think it's all they can get use out of in life. Most kids, if they are not addicted to the computer, then they are hooked to their phone. Some kids rely on their phone too much and cannot put it down. So policy 2 is probably better.

Most students that bring their phones to school need them after school to call and see who is going to pick them up, or if they are going to go walking. If students have their cell phones with them and they are using them during non class time. They will take the advantage and use their cell phones during class. This will make them not want to pay attention in class. The phone will be the distraction and keep them from not wanting to pay attention and learn anything. The phone make a distraction to the rest of the class as well and therefore makes the learning environment a non learning class. When students don't have their phones with them in class it makes them just want to sit in their chair and just listen to the teacher.

Teachers as well would say that students should not have their phones at school, because they are tired of taking it away and tired of hearing it ring or vibrate during the class time.

I think you should go with policy 1. You never know what will come up, so it helps to have a phone with you at all times. In this world that we have now, it's never save outside. As long as they have them off during class it should be all good. But if they have them on and reading a text message or something with their phones then it would be alright for them to take their phone away. There is new technology in the world, and the cell phone is one of them. It would be hard to keep it away from a young person. Policy 2 is not that bad of an idea either but you got to think of what the students want too. Not just what the teachers and you want.

Young people are having fun with all of these new things. You have to let them try things out. It's not all about education all the time. If that was true everyone would be boring and the same. Not different and unique. Everyone has something that makes them different form everyone else and to make them special in their way. The people of America, and the rest of the world are never alike, and never will be. They may have something's in common but face it, no one is the same. You have to think, if I was young in this time period going to school, would i want my principal to be like this?

It's a never ending question. It's always how would you like it. So you have to ask yourself everyday, am I helping out the students or am I just doing this because I like my job? If you are a principal you would be here for the students not because of the money you earn from working. The reason you would work around kids is because you like them not hate them. So if you were a student and your principal was thinking of this, what would you want them to do?

So now you got two choices. Policy one or Policy two? It's your choice not mine. But I know I would pick Policy number one. It helps everyone out. It's why they made the cell phone. Think of this, is it beneficial to others or is it just a horrible idea? Are you making the world a better place by your choice about cell phones? How would this effect the students education? would they be distracted? How might you feel if you weren't able to have your phone on during work if you had someone at home who needed something? Don't just think of the education, because everyone learns everyday. Nothing will change that. You learn from your mistakes don't let this be a mistake that could have been prevented.

It helps if you ask others what they think. Ask the teachers, the students, the parents, the school board and ask your self. It don't just affect you, it affect's everyone.

Policy 1 is better because that way students will be allowed to bring cell phones but will have to focus in class. Then they should be used in lunch breaks so they can take a break from class work. Also its best if they are allowed to bring to school because there can be emergencies and students can call home. Policy 1 is also better because during class time they can be learning and working but when its time for lunch they can use it that way it doesn't have to be only work. They can also have time to call home during break for something they need. Policy number one is also better because only during class it has to be off so they can focus on their work but later on when it is break they can choose to use it. The only time it can be off is during class but that's all, and when it is not class time their cell phones can be on and they will be able to use them without any problem because during class they will turn it off. So policy 1 is really best to use because during class they need to concentrate and do their best and for doing their work they get to use their cell phone after. Policy 2 is not better because students will bring their cell phones because they might need it to call their parents after school or something.

As long as cell phones are not being used during classes. I don't think it's bad because it's students free time. They're not in class so they won't be stopped from learning. Teachers and parents may say this is a bad thing because it might prevent students from learning. I don't believe this to be true because they're using cell phones in free times. Not as they're in classes or studying. The principal should allow students to bring cell phones and use them in free times. This should be the new cell phone policy.

Using cell phones during lunch periods isn't bad. Students will be using their cell phones during a free time given to them. It's not like they're learning something while eating. This won't prevent students learning ability. I t will actually make school more fun and a way to communicate with friends that may not be able to sit together. It could even maybe quite the lunch cafeterias. Students wouldn't have to yell across cafeterias anymore they could just text. Once lunch break is done students would need to put cell phones back or turn them off until another free time.

Sometimes students may be given free time. During this time students should be allowed to use their cell phones. It's their free time so I suggest students should be given the opportunity to use their cell phones. This way students will have something to keep them entertained while having free times. I don't think this is a bad idea because it's a time given to take a break rather than to work.

The use of cell phones during free times will not interrupt students from learning. It won't really matter because either way during free periods students aren't studying anything like in classes. Once students get back to normal classes then they should turn cell phones off to start learning once again. I believe that free periods should be given to let students take a break from studying, including the use of cell phones. I believe that the use of cell phones during free times won't harm students learning ability.

Teachers and parents may not agree on the use of cell phones during free times. Some may say that it will prevent students from learning. This to me is not true because students will be using cell phones during free times rather than learning times. If students are using cell phones during classes, then yes, the use of cell phones will prevent students from learning. Since students will be given the time to use cell phones during free times there will be no need to use cell phones in class. Causing no prevention of learning.

I would rather prefer policy one, which is that cell phones can be allowed in school and you can use them in lunch time or other free times as long as you do not use them in class. Students think that they can just be cool and use their cell phones in class and hide them behind their books that they are reading. News flash for you kids out there that do that , you can get in a lot of trouble for doing that. The reason that they do not allow us to use cell phones during class is because you could text some one during a test that has already took that test and ask for the answers or if you are doing a review for a class.

By doing that you could get phones took away from school permanently. All because you didn't want to study, so you thought you could text someone and get the answers. If to many people did that then we could get them took away permanently from school and never be able to take them on campus. I do love to text and I am sure that most kids my age do. It is not abnormal to want to text all the time.

However whatever you want to send to someone on the phone can wait until after school. Or if you need to tell your parents something or ask them something, do not text them and ask or tell in the middle of class, just go to the office and ask if you can use their phone.

Dear principal I believe that students should bring cell phones to school. Why? simply because they are a important part to our daily life. Cell phones do not hurt anyone's education as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. If cell phones are turned off then students wont be focusing on their cell phones. It would be nice to let students use their cell phones during lunch or during their free time. If students use their cell phones during their lunch then the students wont want to use them during class time because they already used their cell phones during lunch.

Students bring cell phones too school all the time! Telling students not to bring cell phones isn't going to stop them. So why not just let them bring their cell phones to school with the condition making them turn their cell phones off during class time but letting students use their cell phones during lunch periods or even their free time. If the principal lets students use their cell phones during their free time maybe students will get rid of the egger to use their cell phones during class.

If we didn't follow this rules that were applied to us in the code of conduct then we would have to suffer the trouble we would be in.

I believe that you should let us use our cell phones during lunch and passing periods. One reason is that if you let us use them then we will eventually get tiered of using them in school and ultimately stop using them altogether. Also we as students would have less of a want to text and talk in class and just wait for passing period to roll around before we talk. The more we talk the more we will have less to talk about and eventually we will be forced to pay attention in class. If you let us use our phones during restricted times then our grades will go up also the amount of us listening in class will increase.

If you restrict the use of phones altogether then the amount of students using phones during class will increase and grades will decrease. Also if you ban phones then more student will be talking in class rooms. More students will be less likely to listen and pay attention then students that don't even have phones or friends.

In all consideration the best chose is to let what is already going to happen, happen and if the turn out is the same then so be it.

Hi. My name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student at SCHOOL_NAME and I am part of the Student Body Council. I have a strong opinion on the two policies that you have asked the Student Body Council to deliberate on and give you our opinions. I believe that Policy 1, Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is the best choice. Now let me tell you why.

First of all, if you choose Policy 2, Do not allow students to have phones at school at all, is the worst option, I believe. I have done research and according to Psychologist OTHER_NAME, ninety percent of schools that do not allow phones at school have unhappy children which eventually affects their behavior and their attitude toward other kids, teachers, and administrators.

If a student has to go to after school because he has to make up a test, that student would have to call his parents. If you do not allow phones at school he cannot call his parents which can eventually result in him getting grounded because his parents didn't know that he had to stay after school and were extremely worried about him. It could also result in him walking home which is a huge risk because he could get hit by a car or kidnapped.

I agree with Policy 1 because if students abide by that policy than there would be no reason to take the phones away. Of course if a student doesn't abide by the policy, he or she should get his or her phone taken away and his or her parents would have to pick it up from the school.

I hope you listen to my opinion about this matter because it is not fair if we don't get to use the right to use our phones, when we already have that right. Please listen, think, and discuss with other students about what policy they think should be enforced.

I believe that policy 1 is far better than policy 2 because the students should be able to use their free time however they want to use it and allowing cell phones is a good idea. It gives the students more freedom to use their free time the way they want to use it and I think it helps make school fun for the student body. Also if they must speak to a parent or a guardian about something they have the chance to do it if cell phones are allowed. Honestly, I don't see any harm in using policy 1 if the cell phones are turned off during class time. I am also sure that the students will follow policy 1 entirely and turn off cell phones before class.

Surely, most teachers already know students carry around cell phones so I don't expect this to be a drastic change and I don't believe the teachers mind, in fact I have seen some teachers answer their cell phones during class.

Me personally, I think you should allow phones in school. The reason I say this is because sometimes there might be an emergency and you need to call your parents. But the only thing, is that students might text answers to a friend while taking a test. I think that the teacher(s) should take the phones away at the beginning of class and then at the end of class, return them to the students. The only time they should have their phones is at lunch, or during any break that they have during school. If you disapprove, then a lot of students are going to bring their cell phones anyways and just hide their phones in their pockets and use them secretly.

A lot of kids use their phones to text. Sometimes they use them during school hours to text other friends in different schools that are allowed to bring their phones, but they'll do it secretly. Some people use their phones just to call, not text. But at school, they should only have them at lunch break, and after school. But at one point they shouldn't have their phones because they might cheat, or it might disturb them while the teacher is a talking about something important. Their phones might ring in class and the sound of the vibration might disturb others.

I support both reasons. One, is because with cell phones you call make emergency calls to parents or your legal guardian if you forgot something at home and see if they can bring it to you. Reason two, is because if your phones rings in class, you'll disturb not one, but many people, because some students want to learn and listening to what the teacher is saying. But I mostly support the bring phones policy even though they might do something bad, like cheat for example.

The truth is, a lot of students will cheat with their in tact. But it's on their education, they need to learn from their acts. If they want to learn that perfectly fine, but if they want to mess around and NOT pay attention in class, that's their fault. Not the teachers. The teachers are there to help you with your education, and if you don't want to pay attention, fine, don't, your hurting yourself and your education.

I fully support bring phones to school. But it's your choice if you want to allow students to bring their phones because your the principal and its your choice whether or not. But I'm just saying that you should allow phones at school, for emergency purposes only.

In school you could also fall and get hurt and if nobody is around they can call for help. Finally students sometimes text other people when there not suppose to so if you can let us use it during free time and lunch time we might not use them at inappropriate times.

The school should go with policy 1.

I think this because some students need to contact their parents right after school.

I also think that students should be allowed to use phone in lunch periods and free time because its another way of being social and kids need to be social.

What if they need a for or something important they could call their parents and ask their parents to bring it to school.

Another reason I think students should be allowed to bring phones to school is if something happens to the school and the school is not able to contact the students parents the students themselves could contact their parents.

If the school went with policy two most students would still bring their phones.

Although I agree with policy one there are some risks to bringing your phone to school.

Your phone could get stolen.

You could get it confiscated.

If phones get stolen there will be accusations and there will be some students who would fight because of those accusations.

There could be more fights and stolen properties and parents would get upset and they could press charges to the school or the person who stole the phone.

Another reason policy two could be better is because most rumors start of as a text or something someone posts on like facebook.

Policy two could stop some rumors.

It would not stop all the rumors because rumors can be started outside of school where students would have access to their phones.

These are the good and bad things about policy one.

This is why I have chosen policy one.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
4AF4567BBE9F,"Policy 1

Policy 1 states that students are allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as phones are turned off during class time. I believe this policy should be used. I believe this policy should be used because students are given the right to communicate with others. If they use them on their free time then i don't believe it would be distracting to others. You might be thinking "" why would they need them?"". There are multiple reasons. one would be a personal connection, if a family member is sick, in the hospital, or has had experience with falls, injuries, and needs someone to talk to, then i feel it is my job to help them at any time. so on my free time, i would call to make sure that they are okay, and if they need someone to talk to I'm here for them. If this policy is abused then it can be taken away. I think if students were allowed to use their phones at certain times then they wouldn't use them during class. It would make schools more appealing to students that don't feel that school is as reasonable as teachers and parents claim it to be. However, There are negatives to this policy as well. For example, after lunch, when phones are supposed to be turned off, students will not want to turn them off, due to the conversation that they were previously in because they still want to talk to this person(s). Another example of a negative affect is that after lunch, or there free time, they could be distracted by a text that might have upset them, like a break up, gossip, or cyber bulling. Policy 2 is unfair, and could cause student to break that policy, and not like school because they feel that it is a ""Stupid"" or ""Unreasonable"" rule. Also cheating is a problem with cell phones. Even though schools usually don't have service, it can lead to cheating, especially after lunch. I know this one school where the students put their phones on the teachers desk before the test, and they get it back as soon as its done. I belive that",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I think that it would be a good idea for some students to bring their phone but only at lunch break and free periods. Then when the time is over you should tell them to put their phones or electronic devices away or you will take them. If they start to bring their phone to class and it goes off then you should take it and let their parents come to get it. Some students may take it to far, but you should tell them to put their phones away to their free period or lunch break.

People can have their phone in school but only on free periods and certain people try to take advantage of that, but if they get out of control with having their cell phone you should tell them to put it away. You should give them at least 2 warnings and if they mess it up they don't get the phone privileges like the other kids do.

So its okay to have your phones every once in a while. If you hear someone's phone ring you should take it and give it back at the end of the day. Some people may try to take advantage and make their cell phone ring on purpose just to make everyone laugh at them. If they refuse to give you their electronic device you should call the guardian and let them punish the child. Sometimes its not good for them to have a phone because it could get people in trouble sometimes, because somebody may be silly and text the other person. Trying to get them to get in trouble, but if it was them they would be hurt. If you think we should have our phones at free time that would be a very good idea. Certain people know what they word free time means but some don't . You suppose to follow the rules the give you and put your phone away.

Cell phones are one of the most important things to us kids these days. I think that we should be able to use them during lunch and our free time because it's completely understandable to want to have kids focused during their class time. The hours during school are some of the most important when it comes to developing an education, but why not during our free time when no one is teaching? When nothing important is really going on in our free-time?

I think that during lunch and free times during school is a perfect time for cell phone usage like texting. It's not in the way of our education process and its the time when we like to have connections, and talk with our friends if their not right there next to us having a conversation. I understand why teachers don't like their students to have their phones out in the middle of the classroom- because it distracts them from learning in class on things that will help them to succeed in life to fulfil their dreams of what they want to be in life.

Teachers are always getting on to students about talking to loudly or talking to much, but you know maybe during those lunch times if we text our friends instead at lunch or a little in between our classes, maybe things would be a little more quieter and possibly more organized instead of us running around like crazy, screaming for our friends- you dislike that behavior- so why not try to make things a little more organized? A little more quiet?

Students and most kids with cell phones usually try to text during class and hide it when something important comes up- and yes most of your staff ( teachers ) would say if its that important write it down and tell them when you see them. But there's the dilemma, what if you don't even see that person in your classes? What if its a friend of yours and they missed something in class because they were absent that and they need to text them during their passing period to say ""Oh hey buddy you missed the quiz on ecology."" or something along the lines of "" Hey you missed a few work sheets in math today, ill pick them up for you and bring them to you after school."" They should be able to use a phone during free time or lunch, or some other time when their not in class learning.

Also to have this privilege on the way in to any of the students classes they have their phones checked. To ensure the teachers that their phones are off- to respect the policy and its guidelines to having that privilege.

These are some reasons that we should allow kids to have their phones out ONLY in free time, lunch, passing periods, anything that's not during their class time that can disrupt their learning process- if its a friend missing school, some one being late, trying to be more organized, or if you need to tell someone something really important and cant wait until you see that person 3 hours later? And have them be checked to make sure their off on the way in to class? Maybe these reasons can help you pick the better policy ; policy one: to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8

I strongly suggest that we have an absolutely no tolerance rule for phones. Phones all over the world everywhere are starting to cause major issues i our society. They have become a huge distraction in schools, homes and even businesses.

Allowing a zero tolerance policy on cell phones I believe can path the way to success for many generations to come. If we continue to let students bring their phone to school scandalous things can happen or continue to happen. With phones in students pockets we have no clue what they could be doing during anytime let alone a test! These students can be sending answers to one another, telling people what on the test, basically anything could happen. I believe if we allow absolutely no phones this won't be happening.

Also students could be sending inappropriate text messages. Plus with all this new and advanced technology today worse things can be done I ensure you that! Teenagers have been caught with disgusting pictures, depressing chain texts and just texts in general. This horrid thing has to be stopped this cannot go on!

So please help the community and have a zero tolerance policy cell phones. This solution I have come up with can not only help your school but everybody involved. It can help parents, teachers, board members and others. I hope this helps you on your final decision.

I am writing you on behalf of the students at SCHOOL_NAME

about the new cell phone policies that you are considering:

Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.

Although I realize that Policy 2 has some benefits of its own I ask you to strongly consider Policy 1. Policy 1 you would only approve if you knew that you could trust us. So if you don't not approve that plan are you saying that you don't trust the kids at your school. That would only reflect badly upon you.

My second reason that you should allow kids to have phones at school would be because children should be learning by now that they should know when and when not it is appropriate to use cell phones. Allowing them never to learn this skill will only result in a future problem of our generation getting fired because they do not know when it is appropriate to take out there cell phone.

My third and final reason is that some parents after school forget to pick up there kids so the child needs some way of reaching them so that they are not forgotten. After all no school wants kids roaming around it 3 hours after school has ended because some parent forgot to pick up there kids.

I agree that we should not have our cell phones out during class except for lunch. During lunch some kids might want to take pictures to have a memory of that special occasion or regular day. I also agree that when a class has free time, we should have a right to have our cell phones out or any other type of device as long as we are not doing anything educational at the moment.

AED1693001E4,"Dear principal, cell phones are a very good thing to have at school just because if there was an emergency and a student needed to call their parent or guardian, they wouldn't have to worry. you shouldn't ban phones. i personally think that would make it worse, and here's why.

say at one point someone had to wait for the bus in a very unfriendly and kind of scary neighborhood, and the next thing you know is that child is trying to grab their phone because some stranger is coming over. then they realize that their principal banned them from school, so they couldn't call for help. we here on the news all the time of kids being stolen. for instance, the other day i just heard of 2 people trying to get two girls in their van. there is some very weird people in this world.

another reason is because, you have to cut the kids some slack letting them use their phones on lunches and break, i think, is a good idea. and i really hope you like that idea too. because face it, i' m pretty sure kids will end up taking their phones to school. and i know some parents who make their kids take their phones to school, just in case something may happen.

all I'm saying is that letting kids bring their phones to school wont be so bad as long as you have ground rules. which you do, so i really don't think its going to be a problem. if you let them only have it on during breaks, and not class, it will all work out in the end. trust me.

I think if policy one was in our rules most of us would do better , and wont pay attention to there phones as much because they know in a certain time im going to be able to look at my messages or what ever mail you have . Another reason its a good idea because there be less arguing , teachers would stop yelling at the students to put there phone away . If this ever happen it would be good because most of us cant live with out a phone , like me . Last, cellphones work for when people have to call home , instead of using the office phone they can just wait till the period to use phones and call and tell them what they got to say . Also, when we have free time instead of thinking on doing something stupid , we'll just take out our phones and just chill . Well your a good principal and hope you do the right decision .

If Kids make plans during school to hang out with friends or to stay after school and work on homework. Kids that play sports also have practice after school and sometimes practice is cancelled or moved to a different time.

With a phone, kids can send a quick text to their parents and quickly call them and ask if they can do something after school or tell them about the practice change. Without a phone, kids have to track down a teacher and ask them to use their phone to call. They have to type in the code so that they can call out of the school district. That takes up extra time, and teachers don't always allow kids to use their phone.

Some kids walk to school. If it's a winter morning there may be ice on the ground. A kid walking to school might slip on the ice and fall and hurt themselves. If they have a phone with them they can call up their parents asap and get help. If they don't have a phone, they might have to sit or lay on the cold icy ground until someone finds them. Kids also have friends in other schools.

Kids like to keep in touch, so they text each other. If kids didn't have phones during their free time at school they would barely get to talk to their friends from other school. 8 hours at school, then 1 hour 30 minutes or 2 hours at practice if they play sports (most kids play sports), then homework which could take awhile, plus eat dinner and shower and get sleep. Where do you text in that schedule?

I understand that having phones at school can cause kids to text during class, which is bad. They can make kids put them in baskets, on the teacher's desk, or make them leave it in their locker to prevent texting in class. Making kids leave their phones at school can make a big mess. Kids would always be complaining. Kids that transfer schools may become depressed because they can't talk to their old friends. Parents would be complaining because it would be harder to contact their kid or kids. Kids get picked up after school, and parents normally tell them who is picking them up. If something changes and someone else is picking them their parents have to call the office, give them all the details, have them find you, and then give you the message about who's picking you up. If kids were allowed phones, the parent could have quickly sent a text. The kid would have got the message during a free time, making it a lot easier. Kids should definitely be able to have phones at school during their free times.

Texting during free times isn't going to hurt anything, or anyone. So why should you take it away? Having phones can help keeps kids social. It will also help them stay occupied and stay out of trouble. I think kids should have phones during lunch and other free times, do you?",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8

I think that your fist policy is the best because if kids don't bring their phones to school then well they are not be able to call for help during a emergency like if the power went out or if the teacher is gone and there is a break in or if some staff member needs medial treatment and the power is out or if school gets out and a friend ask if you can come over after school. If you chooses the other on people are still going to bring their phones to school anyway so why not let them have it at school just have rules for them not consequences.

Maybe if you let them more people will listen and not get in as much trouble. If people start to listen then well people won't get suspended as much. Now if you choose the second policy then people will not listen and bring there phones to school and you would just be suspending kids who just brought their phone to school. You would have a lot more suspicions or detentions.

If the first policy is chosen then you wouldn't have to keep nagging kids to put away their cell phones or stay all night and wait for parents to come pick up their kids cell phone.

If you pick the first policy the kids will be much happier and the parents happier they don't have to go pick up their kids phone. So please pick policy one. If you pick policy one then the kids will most likely like their principle and not hate her.

I understand that Policy 1 is already the school's cell phone policy, but Policy 2 is what I believe to be the better of the choices. Instead of allowing us to bring and use them during free times, phones should not be permitted at school.

Being a student here myself, I have witnessed the lack of recognition the policy has been given. Mostly every student with a cell phone switches them to silent or vibrate while they are in class, and some do not even bother to conceal the constant rings emitted. Every few days there is one phone in one class that goes off, and the lesson is suddenly interrupted until the suspect is found and has faced the consequences.

Not only are the phones still on during learning times, but some are even put to use. Countless times have I seen someone pull out their cell phone and once concealed from the adult's view, send messages that will probably end up ringing a phone in another room. Behind jackets, below books, hidden in pockets and, sometimes, just out in the open when the ruler of the class has turned their back -the phone is brought out.

Even though its understandable to keep them, just in case of emergency or need to assure parents that the child is well, it's better to leave that for phones on campus, preferably ones that are not cellular. If a student ever needs to contact a parent to pick them up, remind them of their late return home, or make any important call of the sort, they should report to the office, ask for permission, and call from there.

Not allowing cell phones may provoke students to bring and hide them, but spotting them should be easy if others follow the rule. Policy 2 would be the ideal way of keeping sixth, seventh, and eighth-graders in line, and away from one of the main distractions that prevent them from doing their uttermost best.

I think you should allow students to be able to bring their cell phones to school to use during lunch and other free periods.

This will allow students to talk to their friends and help them enjoy their time off from the long day of work they put in. It is also important that students bring their cell phones to school because it allows them to communicate with family or friends about plans or other after school activities. Students should turn them off during class so they don't disturb the class and affect their learning. If you allow students to bring their cell phones and allow them to use them during lunch periods or other free periods it will cut down on texting in class. I think this because now students don't have to text during class they just have to wait until their lunch or free periods. Which I think every student can do.

The problem with not having students bring their cell phones at all is that kids are going to do it anyway because they really depend on their cell phone for different things. Like I need to bring my phone to school not to talk to my friends, but to now how I'm getting home with my sport practices. So it is really important for me to bring my phone school.

I think as you reconsider the school's cell phone policy this letter could help you decide. I think that you should choose policy 1; allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

Other people may say cell phones are distracting, but as long as you enforce the seconds part of the policy which is, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, it shouldn't be a distraction. The distraction comes when students are using their phones inappropriately, whether it be for messing around, or using your phone at times when you shouldn't be.

Having your cell phone out at lunch time and free time should be allowed. It's not hurting anyone to have them out, and it won't be distracting anyone because it's a free time anyways. Without being able to use cell phones at lunch times and free times, students just wander around aimlessly with nothing to do.

Students should be allowed to have cell phones at school. Students use their cell phones to communicate not only among one another, but to their parents as well. Without cell phones the school's phones would be crowded with students lost trying to find their parents and/or family members. I remember before I got my cell phone, it was hard to communicate with my brothers and my mother, because even if I called my home from the school phone, if there is no answer, how am I going to get a call back? We can't have half the school at the office trying to get a hold of their parents. Policy 2 would be completely ridiculous with most students relying on their phones for communication to make it home each day.

It is important for students to have their cell phones at school, and it would be completely harmless for a student to have their cell phone out during lunch time or free time. Would it really be free time if the students can't even text or call one another? Policy 1 should be chosen for the schools cell phone policy.

My opinion is that cell phones should not be allowed at all during the whole school time. I think it would distract us from our learning environments, and someone might accidentally leave their cell phone on and it might ring during a class. Students might get carried away and think that if the teacher lets us have it in the halls or lunch then they might pull it out in class. I know so many students would want to have their phone but that also might affect maybe a students relationship with a friend. Maybe a friend is so attached to his or her cell phone during school that the time she usually spent with her friends during a free period they would be on their phone.

Some people that don't have phones might vote for policy 2 because they will fill left out of conversations with their friends. I didn't have my phone for a long time because I got it taken away. Everyone would think I don't have a phone but I wouldn't care. Phones are pointless to me unless i need to communicate with somebody. I might have a project due tomorrow and my partner would be having a good conversation about the project and how they are going to get an ""A"" on their project which i did myself. That has happened to me before but I found out so I did two projects. My friend was on his phone so much and I did it all.

I don't think phones should be allowed at school because we will be distracted. I think phones are worthless like I said before but they are important to most people to day. In my opinion, I say policy 2 because I don't have a cell phone right now because of my grades. Also because I lost the charger.

I think that the school should allow policy 1. Every student should be allowed to bring their cell phone to school.

One reason i think policy 1 should be chosen is because the students could use their cell phone during lunch. The student can also use his/her phone when they have free time during class as long as they have permission from the teacher. The student should also have their phone off during class when the teacher is teaching so they wont get distracted.

Another reason policy 1 should be chosen is because we should be able to bring our phones as long as were learning. If were still learning and paying attention in class there's no need to take our phones away.

Those were reasons why i want you to choose policy 1. It may seem like a bad decision but, it could turn out good as long as the students follow this policy.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

Having cell phones in school isn't a good idea. They provide distractions, ways to cheat on assignments, and they could get stolen, lost, or ruined. Having cell phones at school can cause many problems.

They provide a plentiful amount of distractions. Students could be texting in class and not be paying attention to what the teacher is saying and it will affect test and quiz scores because students will not know what they are doing since their cell phone had their attention, not the teacher. If a cell phone starts ringing in the middle of class, the noise will distract other people in the room. Other students might know the song that is being played and start singing along and being obnoxious with it. A cell phone would also be a nuisance to teachers because if it is out while they are teaching, they have to confiscate them and it takes away from the time they have to teach.

Cell phones could mean cheating on assignments because another student who has already taken the test and knows all of the answers could text the answers to someone while that person is taking their test. A student could put the answers into their phone and look at it while they are testing. Students could also pass the phone with answers on it around to everyone else taking the test.

Cell phones could get stolen and cause fights. If someone who owns a phone leaves it for just a second, another student could take the phone. Then, the student who's phone was stolen could figure out who took it and get upset with the other person, possibly even causing a fist-fight. If someone's phone gets lost, parents could be very upset at their child. Also, students could have fights, oral and fist, about who's phone is better.

Students bringing phones to school and being able to use them is a very bad idea and could hurt the school by rupturing grades and the students themselves. Bringing cell phones into schools shouldn't happen, and I hope you see why.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6
65991D1DA389,"I think that, policy number one is genius. You should let the students bring there phones during free periods and lunch periods. When your phone is turned on someone can call you or text you. you don't have to be using your phone for you to get a call or a message. It should not be on during class time. Class time is learning time. The society has changed very much through out the years.

Many people have call phones around the world. All teens can think about is staying on the phone all the time. Technology has taken over the young minds of teens over the past few years. Not many people take to others face to face anymore. There some people that say they can not live without the uses of technology.

During the lunch periods, everyone talks to each other while eating, so why not have the usage of a cell phone. For such a small device it can distract many people. If they are not turned off during the class time it will beep or make a noise that will stop the learning process of class time. There is a time for fun and there is time for learning. Class time is for learning. The policy should also apply for teachers too.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
F84CB4D0589A,"I believe that it would be better to allow students to have their cell phones out during lunch or free time because many teenagers think that their cell phone is an extension of their body or something that they need and can not live without. If you let the students have their cell phones out during lunch or free time there would be less problems with someone texting in class.

I think that the reason people are so dependent of their cell phones is because it is a quick and easy way to talk to their friends.

I think if you do not let them have their cell phones there would be more problems with them texting or calling people in class because as teenagers we do not like being told what not to do or what to do.

So I believe that if you let them use their phones during lunch time or free time but not during class would be a better solution then taking their phones away completely.

granted a cell phone can be very useful during an emergency situation but not during the time your supposed to learn.

But there are some drawbacks to allowing students to have their phones is that they may think that it is ok to use their phone during class. so i believe that it would be best to put the student's name on the phone and place it in a bin in front of the class so you can know that the student is not texting or calling any one in class while the teacher is talking and you can see to it that they get their phone back after class.

That is why i believe that it would be wise to allow students to have their phones turned on during lunch or free time as long as the student has the cell phone turned off during class.

Most of the teenagers use there phones half of there life, Reconsidering the school's cell phone policy is a great idea, for many reason and some of the reasons are these. Even though you say not to bring cell phones to school students still do it , some of the students need to bring there phones to school to communicate with there parents telling them that they're at school. Other students need there phones incase of an emergency, and there parents need to contact there kids or the parents need to be contacted, the school can use there phones. It is a great idea letting the students use there phones during lunch or free periods that gives the students a feeling of trust from the school.

Not allowing students to use there phones at all is not really going to help. The students will find a way to bring there phones to school and use them while the teachers are not looking. Most of the students are already doing it, why you think putting a new policy is going to help the school it really is not, but by letting the students bring there phones in school and giving them time to use them is going to let the students know that the school trusts them, that the school doesn't think of them as children but as young and responsible adults.

To change the policy you have to look at the problem is booth ways in the mind of a teacher and in the mind of a student. Some of the teachers may think by bringing a phone to school is a sign of not having respect but it really isn't students don't mean to be rude. Sometimes there parents even ask them to bring there phones, other times the students want to bring there phones. The students in the other side feel as if the school doesn't trust them by not letting them bring there phones to school, they feel like children. All of this can be resolved if you let the students bring there phones to school and have them off and not use them, and letting them use them in there free time.

I believe that for the safety and convenience of the student body, Policy 1 is the ideal choice for our school.

Sometimes students are forgetful and we leave important items at home in the morning. We ask to call our parents but many teachers do not allow us to use their phone because it will take time out of our educational period. If Policy 1 is ratified, then the students would be able to call or text their parents during their off periods. By this, no class time would be taken away and we would receive the items we are in need of.

A students cell phone could be extremely useful in an emergency where the teacher is not around or if the teacher were to pass out or be very badly injured . While someone runs to find an adult, the other could dial an emergency number so that help can arrive to the school as soon as possible. In a case like this, a students cell phone could potentially be a life saver.

If a student were to get sick and had to be sent home, the nurse would most likely call their parents. If the child's guardian refuses to answer the phone because its an unknown number, the student could use his/her phone to help the school nurse get in contact with their parent.

For these reasons, cell phones should be allowed at school according to Policy 1. Our cellular devises could make the school day much easier for everyone, including the student body, faulculty and guardians of the students.            ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I think you should let us have cell phones in school. Cell phones could be useful in times of needs. Like if they have a person in the school, who shouldn't be there, We (The Students) could call the cops incase if the teacher doesn't have no device to make calls with. There wouldn't be anyone else there to make the call

When Its school times we can just turn them off, so that they won't distract the other kids from learning. We all know phones can be distracting when your phone come on, but its just a little distraction. It doesn't mean that their just going to forget the subject all the sudden.

People just know that when kids have cell phone during school time all were going to do is text during class. Its not true because there wouldn't be no point of school if your just going to text during class the whole day.

Actually, when you're texting, the phone will show you that's your making errors and you will eventually correct yourself. That is almost like the subject English. In ELA, don't we correct sentences and stuff like that? Its just like texting your friends. You have to send them messages with correct spelling.

So all I say is that we should just have cell phones during school. It can help us in the future one day.

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I would like to discuss a policy about cell phones that I heard you were considering.

I personally think that policy 1, the one when kids are allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch and free periods but must be turned off during class, is the right one.

One reason why I think that this policy is the right one is because kids should have cell phones.

It's a great way to communicate with your friends and family.

But if you are going to install this rule, there must be some limits. Kids should turn their cell phones off during class because it could distract the teacher, the class, and the person him/herself. If a teacher sees a kid playing with a cell phone or if it goes off in class, the teacher should take it away. But another good reason to have cell phones is if the school has a fire or another emergency.

Kids could easily get in touch with their parents to let the know that they are all right. Also, another thing not a lot of people think about that could be good or bad is homework.

Kids could text each other to find out what the homework is if they don't have it, but they could also send texts or pictures of the answers.

A reason that I would question about: what about teachers?

Would teachers be allowed to have their phones out whenever they wanted?

Or can they only have them out if they have some free time?

This is all something that could impact the education of the kids, but I'll let you decide that one.

One more reason kids would love to have their cell phones in school is that they can take pictures of their friends in school if there was an unforgettable moment or something like a cool memory to capture.

There are numerous reasons good or bad to install the rule about cell phones, but I hope that you will consider this letter in your deciding.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I think that kids should be allowed to have their phones out during lunch or any other free time. If kids do take advantage of having phones out during class and texting other classmates or texting inappropriate then they shouldn't be able to have there phones out during lunch or other free times. That doesn't mean you should punish everyone.

One reason kids should be able to have there phones out during lunch time is because some kids have to text or call parents about tutorials after school or after school practice because if you have after school practice for track and your suppose to go and practice at the high school and the weather is getting bad you would have to call/text your parents to tell them your not going to practice or your going to stay at the school until whatever time the coaches say, also if you have to stay for tutorials after school and the teacher tells you during class then how is your parents going to know to pick you up or not.

Another reason is because some kids have medical conditions that call for medicines, insulin, or anything else that will help, but not all kids wanna go to the office and call every time he/she needs them, so that's why we should be allowed to have phones out during lunch or other free times.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
A8BBC8F598F4,"I think that we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and any other free time because what if there is an emergency or they get kid napped from school, they could just call there parents or 911. They just can have the cell phone off in class so if they are tacking a test or something when it is silent in the classroom, and the student might of forgotten to turn the volume down and it could just ring and possibly mess everyone up.

I don't think the second policy should be a policy because the students at the school need some communication to there parents if needed. If the parents bought there child a cell phone and the child goes to a school where cell phones are not allowed, then that sounds like a waste of money for the parents. The parents might end up taking the child/children out of that school and put them in a different school and then the school where the cell phones are not allowed might not get a good reputation from the parents.

I think that you should allowed the students of your school to use there cell phones when they have the time to. The students should have in mind that when the teacher ask them to put it always that they well. But also to remember that they have the right to use them. Will this is why I think that allowing the students to have there phones with them is ok. One because they want to time in school to call friends that may not be in the same school or if they have an important thing to do after school in they can't go. Another is if they need help with something and on one is with them . Now I what you might be saying that the students are never going to leave their phones not even if there in class. will there can be a punishment to that person that dose not flow the rules. You can assigned any thing to that person like after school clean up or Saturday school something like that so that they know not to do it again and that they need to lessen to the teacher when they are ask to well that is all i have to say principal.

So many students who go to school own a cell phone, and most students bring their cell phones everywhere with them-- including school. I personally think that allowing cell phones in school is a good idea if students are only allowed to use them during lunch or other free times. Cell phones are a good thing to have when you need to organize something, make an important call, email, etc.

Allowing phones in school is not something to think twice about.

Phones are important to have if a student needs to make an important call to family, friends, etc. If a student needs to make a call about an emergency or a personal issue during school that they do not feel the school should know about, then having a phone with you could solve that problem.

Phones are also a useful thing to have if a student needs to organize what they are doing after school with their parents/friends. Phones would also make it easier to contact someone if there was a change of plans which could disrupt schedule. Having a phone is an easy was to organize that kind of issue.

If a student has a phone with them, it would become useful if a student needs to contact a friend about a project or schoolwork during school hours. It would be a good way to organize the time they could use to complete--in this case-- a project they were doing together and the materials they would need to do so. I think that would be very helpful.

There are many good uses for a phone in school. The students would not misuse the phone either because they would only be allowed to use the phone during certain times. Having a phone in school would make it much easier for students to organize what they need to do with their peers, or contact family members during an important situation. Having a phone would make a big change in the school system. This would not be a bad change, it would be a good one.

As a student's perspective I think that the school board shouldn't have any cell phones allowed at all. The young generations all ready uses technology about 17 hours a day when they come to school, their intelligence and thoughts should be focused on school there are some students that will follow the rules and only use their cell phones during lunch and other free times. However as a teenager perspective, students will try to use their cell phones during class it's been proven many times before.

Many of the smart phones of these modern times are fascinatingly convenient and impressive. One of the more popular phone called the iphone, has: a g. p. s. system, go on the internet, text call and I.M. all at the same time and has much as 16 gigga bites with way more features than that. Most phones can do that as well even more, some people depend on their or PDA because their plans, schedules connections with people all over the world is on their device. Although students come to school to gain an education, the can't focus and do that correctly with cell phone distracting them. If the students are detracted form what they need to do, that eventually leads to bad grades, not a good job and worse lack of education, and with these present days, it is mandatory to have a good education.

Also, if the students lose their phone they have trouble to deal with. Now, I do realize that if a person does lose their hone they can tell the company buy a new and have all the information transferred to that new cellular phone. Yet, if you do that you are still burning through money in to something very wasteful. And sometimes you don't even lose, some students would actually have the nerve to steal other peoples cell phones which dies happen at a so increase. Many students call and text their family and friends, not a lot are doing business calls and making plans for certain events. Some would say if there was ever an emergency at the school they should be able to have their phone and call their parent. But part of the faculties job is to protect from the outside danger.

I think policy one is the best policy because kids are allowed to bring other stuff to school. kids walk home and parents usually want kids to have there cell phones just in case of an emergency. I think if you chooses the second policy there would be a big problem with parents and kids. If a teacher see' s or hear' s a cell phone during class then take it away and give it to the office just like normal.

I think most people would choose policy one because it seems like a better policy to have. If you choose policy two there would be a problem with kids bringing phones to school anyway. I don't think anybody would pay attention to your rules and policy's, kids would still bring cell phones to school. I don't think very many kids text in class, and if they do i still think they are getting their work done. To me cell phones aren't a big deal in schools. so i think we should just keep it how it is, and not have to worry about it anymore. Policy number one is a better policy then policy two.

Policy number one is a better policy because a lot of kids walk home after school and if something bad happens and they don't have their cell phone it would not be good so its better if we don't take that chance. Some kids go home with another friend after school, the parents usually want the kid to have there cell phone with them just in case there's a change in plan, or kid needs picked up. Its a good thing to keep your phone with you. Another reason why policy 1 is the better policy is because most kids have sports after school. After a sport they might need to call someone to come pick them up or call someone for any other reason. Its a dumb idea to have to keeps phones at home, when we need them with us. thank you.

First, sometimes we have after school events and may need to call our parents. Our school has Drama Club, FFA, Key Club and many more. If we have a meeting after school and our parents can't get off of work we may need to call our dads. Or any other relative. This is one reason why we should be allowed to have phones at school.

Second, what if there was an emergency and our parents need to know about it. I do not think that the school will be able to notify every kids parents. If we were able to have our phones we would be able to tell them ourselves and they could come get us. This is my second reason why i think we should be able to have our phones at school.

Lastly, i think we should be able to have our phones because it is a way for some people to get a ride home if they don't ride a bus. Some parents have to work and don't have let their kids stay at home alone.

So they may need to call a friends or grandparent. Or if their parents are running late to pick them up. They might want to call and make sure that their parents are okay and see if they are almost there.

All in all, i think we should be able to have our phones at school just not in class. First we have club and after school meetings we might need to call our parents.

E6267F2931AF,"Dear Principle:

One of the reasons families give their kids cell phones is so that they can keep in touch and always know where their child is. I thinks that you should allow students to bring their phones to school and let them use their phones at lunch or during free times.

If you had a child that went to school a long ways from where you lived, you would want to know where they are, when they are coming from school and if they need to be picked up early from school. In the first week of school, when I was a sixth grader, I was in desperate need of a phone. I accidentally left my coat in one of my classrooms and so at the end of the school day, I went to look for it. When I first got there, it took me a long time for me to find it, but when I did, I realized that my bus had already left. so, here was a sixth grader on her 4th day of school, sitting and looking for some way to call my mom to pick me up. About 5 minuets went by and there was still no ride for me. Thankfully, one of my friends gave me a ride home and my parents decided that i needed a phone. From then on, I always call my mom telling where I am after school.

You may be thinking that you can just out phones in the office for after school purposes. But, kids don't always remember important things, for example their homework. Also, the students might need their parents to bring them something during school. There have been many times when I have forgotten my homework at home or that I needed my mom to bring me something. For example, I had a big project, for my science class, that I had been working so hard on for about the past week. My project was a model of a cell and was worth a lot of points. The morning it was due, I got off my bus and realized that I left me cell model at home.

I was so nervous because if I turned it in a day late then I wouldn't the credit that I had worked so hard for. So very quickly I took out my phone and called my mom asking her to bring my project to school before my science class. She was perfectly fine with that and brought over my project. I received an A on my project and was glad that i had a cell phone to call my mom and ask her for my project.

Therefore, from personal experience, I believe that you should choose the policy that allows for students to bring their phones to school but turned off during class times and are allowed to be out during lunch or other free times. Please consider what I have Written and I hope you are happy with the choice you make on the new policy.

I as a student, think you should follow Policy 1. You should choose policy one because it is a reasonable option. If you choose Policy 1, there will be no cheating because the cell phones will be allowed during lunches and free time. Students will thank you for giving them more freedom with their cell phone.

Students won't feel like they have to sneak around with their cell phones anymore. If the cell phones are turned off during class periods that would be a great idea because it would be less of a distraction to the cell phone user and their classmates around them. I think you should trust us fellow students with this generous privilege. We deserve this opportunity.

If us students are misusing this privilege, just simply take it away from us. If its just one person misusing the policy, take it away from that one student that is being disrespectful to this privilege. We shouldn't all suffer from one students actions. Its just not fair.

Policy 1 is the best choice. It is the best choice you could pick because the students that you are giving this opportunity will highly appreciate it. That is a true fact. There might be other students that don't have cell phones that don't want you to choose Policy 1 because they think it is distracting. But, how can it be distracting to them if the students that are using the cell phones are not using their cell phones during class periods? If the student doesn't want to be distracted by another students cell phone then they can simply just avoid the cell phone user.

Students need to bring their cell phones to school anyway. What if they need a ride home because they missed the bus? What if they are in some type of emergency and they need someone's help and they have no cell phone to contact anybody that they need? So if you can see, us students need our cell phones everyday. Giving us a privilege to use them at lunch and free time is a fantastic opportunity for you to know if you can trust us or not.

If you choose Policy 2, most students will be upset. They need their freedom. But if you do decide to choose Policy 2 most students including me will respect your choice.

I think that students should be able to bring phones to school because when student are at school they may feel sick and need to text or call their parent to go home.

There is also very little reason for there to be no phones. The only reasons I can think of are texting during class or calling people during time when they could be working.

So in this matter I think that the pros outweigh the cons of this idea.

Kids feel safer when they have a phone because when they are walking home from school or going from class to class they know that help is just a phone call away if they get into trouble.

So to conclude this letter I think that when deciding whether or not to enforce these rules then I think that you should enforce some of the rules but still allow the students to bring them to school.

If you are just looking at the cons of this rule then enforce some rules like no phones in class and if they are seen then they need to be taken away for a week and the parents must pick them up from the office.

So don't let the bad parts ruin all the good things about this idea.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
D25B8D9F7D84,"The first policy I believe would be the best. Allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class. For example if the school's power goes out and students need to be taken home the school phones wouldn't be available. But as long as students have cell phones they can text or call their parents and tell them to come pick them up. This could apply to many other emergency's that could occur. Like an earthquake If it were to happen the power could go out. Wired phones wouldn't work but cell phones would. A cell phone could also save a students life during a fire if they were trapped in a part of the school, but no one knew where to look. They could simply just call the school to inform them that he or she were trapped and give them the location . A parent could also contact a son or daughter If something were to happen at home. If someone forgot their homework, P.E clothes or lunch they could just simply call or text their parents and have them bring it. If the students parent were to come pick up a student late they could call and tell them to go home with a friend.

There would be some negatives like a student disrupting a class with their phones, but as long as they keep them off in class their shouldn't be a problem. Anything like that could be solved with a warning and if they persist on not cooperating take away their phones and have their parents pick it up for them .

Other wise we wouldn't have anything to do during that time. And i believe that i am not the only one who feels this way. Which i am sure you realize. My reasons for my opinion are some of these, we might have an emergency and need to call a parent to come pick us up. During our free time some of our other friends might be in different classes and we might want to talk to them which we could do by cell phones. Our parents might text us because of an emergency. You never know what could or might happen. We also could have unfinished business that we might need to take care of. And cell phones also can be helpful to text a teacher that teaches another class because you might have left something in their classroom or forgot about what you had to finish for homework. You know cell phones can be helpful in many ways that you might not fully see or understand that us teenagers do.

I believe we could bring our phones to school and keep them because if you play a sport you have practice after school. If there was something to happen or go wrong you could call 911. If you are walking and you fall and break a bone. This is some of the reasons i think we could bring our phones to school.

If you play a sport you have practice after school. If your mom and dad get off after school and they go home you have to have a way to get up with them so they can come pick you up. If we could bring our phones to school we could call them and tell them that it is time for them to come pick us up. We could only do this if we could bring our phones to school.

The next reason is if there is a problem like a teacher getting held a t gun point. If this happened the teacher could not do anything because he is at gun point. If we did not have our phone we could not do anything until the bell rang our someone heard a gun shot. If we had our phones we could call 911 and tell the what is happening and the would come an d take care of the things that was happening.

E60257F8B334,"Is something wrong with cell phones being allowed in school? There is no such accunization. Cell phones are used for important purposes and should be allowed in school and usable except in class. That's why i chose to go along with policy one.

Policy one states that cell phones will be allowed in school and that students could use them during lunch and other free periods. However in class, they are to be silenced and put away! There are many reasons for this policy. It also helps the kids not get in trouble as much. Students mostly get in trouble for texting in class.

This policy is trying to prevent students from sharing test answers in class. If they text in class they could be texting their friends telling them the answers and that is called cheating. Cheating is really a wrong thing to do, it shows what you know not your friend. Major consequences are handed out to cheaters that can cause them to fail or suffer in their career choices. Therefore cheating is prohibited.

Another thing that is being prevented is the lack of knowledge. Students think they can text and listen simultaneously. But truth is all the information is going in one ear and out the other. It is important because it can help you in life. Grades reach higher levels than texting in my opinion.

The students shouldn't have a problem because, it gives them the opportunity to use it during the daytime. It's not like a prison where they have no cell phone. Students should be very grateful and lucky. They have many breaks to use them just not when it is time to be focused.

CD954674E1A6,"Dear Principle,

I believe that schools should allow students to take their phone to school, but should only use them in case of an emergency. At lunch or in a free time the students should be talking to their friends that are on the phones contact list or to others who may not have a phone at all and not calling anyone, but their parents, for example if the student broke their ankle then the could call their parents and tell them the situation and not leave them in the dark.

In class students usually use phones even if they are not supposed to and will text the person on the far side of the room.

Some teachers should have the students turn their phone off and put them in a shelf, with a lock so nobody can steal or grab their phone.

Some students would disagree with this but just telling the students to turn the phone of is not enough, because if the teacher walks out of the room the student can turn it back on and continue texting their friends.

An exception could be if a calculator was gone or disappeared and as long as the don't text they should be allowed to use the phone for educational reasons only.

Phones are a major distraction at school and is one of the main reasons students get in trouble some teachers are ok if the phone is in a purse or hidden and actually goes off others not so much.

We should allow cell phones in school and be able to use them at free times and lunch periods but turned off during class time because if something were to happen to us during school when no teachers are around or any friends are around we would have no one to help us but if we had our cell phones with us we would be able to reach some one in a hurry . Also we should allow cell phones in school because during free time kids tend to do dumb stuff but if we had are cell phones we would have something to entertain us and not let us get in trouble .

Also if we had are cell phones in school it wouldn't do us or anyone else no harm . Cell phones are just for communication . This is why i feel that we should have cell phones in school. Also we wouldn't be able to cheat because our phones would have to be off during class time no matter what.

CD1E5F827178,"Dear Principal,

I think the policy in which cell phones are allowed during free time is better than no cell phones at all. Even if you banned cell phones it wouldn't stop kids from bringing them to school. Kids like to keep in touch, which is why they have cell phones. Since they can't talk in class texting is more sneaky than writhing paper notes and throwing them around the classroom where the teachers are watching.

Its also a good time to call parents in free time if they are staying after school of they are riding home with a friend's parent. It feels less tense than asking a teacher to use your cell phone or using the school's phone. If kids are allowed to have their cell phones during free time there may be a chance they won't use their cell phone in class in return. Besides, if they aren't allowed to use their cell phones in school there is a chance they would use it in class and look cool doing it. It would just get other people trying to do it too. And if you are going to let cell phones in school, you have to enforce the rules better than with the 'no cell phones' rule. Give a big consequence if they decide to go against the rules, Like a lunch or an after school detention. Or maybe get their cell phone taken away and they can only get it back after class or school. Also you could probably send it to you, the principal's office where the can get it after school or by rules have a parent pick up the phone. If you enforce this rule you could make all the students sign a contract that they will only use their cell phones during lunch or free time or else they may have to face consequences such as the ones mentioned before. Tell them that this is not a freedom but a privilege.

I think you should allow cell phones to be in school but just at lunch or a free time. That way everyone gets what they want. Kids actually get the opportunity to actually use cell phones at school. If kids get more freedom, so do you. I think you will be very surprised how many students will agree and respect this rule. Kids want to use their cell phones so I'm pretty sure no one will be breaking this policy. You, the principal can be rest assured that kids are using their cell phones at a free time but not in class. And if there were anything to happen with this rule you can always have the right to remove this rule and ban cell phones in school once and for all.

AE6462B51991,"The policy that i believe is not a better policy is policy one because, if you let students bring in there phones to use during lunches and other free time most of them will not turn them off for class and be tempted to use them during class. They would also be a distraction to other kids if other people around them are using them during class. If they go off during class it won't just distract one or two kids it will distract the whole class including the teacher. Then the class won't get what they need done. Another reason is that you don't know what the students are doing on or with their phone. they also might try to call people during class to get a student in trouble. they could also distract the kids that are using them and they might miss out on something important.

The policy i would choose if i was the principal is policy two because, the students not being able to use there phone might make them not want to use it because, they don't want to get in trouble. This policy might keep kid from texting in class while a teacher is not looking or trying to distract another kid and it would force them to listen and learn. I also believe that if the students are not aloud to use their phone then neither should the teachers cause that isn't fair. If we have to use the school phones so should they.

C3EF250CD155,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't think that we should be aloud to bring our cell phones to school because we have no reason to. What are we going to do with our phone? We can't even get on the internet to get on facebook. There is no clear reason why we need it. Other schools use their cell phones in class to do projects and look up things. You can't trust them to actually do their work. You might think they are, but they're probably texting or playing a game.

Another reason that we don't need to have our cell phones in school is because if you were texting, you would just get caught, and the person you were texting would get caught too. We let them off too easy. If they get there phone taken away the first time, they just get it back at then end of the day. They should pay a fee or get ISS if they get caught. But who are we going to text anyway? We all have school. It seems really stupid to keep your phone in your pocket all day, off.

One question you might ask is,""What are we going to do with it?"" Well, what are you going to do with it? There is no point in bringing it to school if we can't use it during the day. We can't get on the internet, if there is no WI-FI. Then you have no use for it at all.

People everyday get their phone taken away because of texting or playing a game or even just having it on your desk. If you don't want to get your phone taken away, then don't play with it during class. It affects peoples learning when they don't pay attention to what the teacher is teaching because of them on their phone. We do not need to bring it to school under any circumstances.

I think students around the world should not use their cell phones at school because it's a distraction to yourself and others around you. Having cell phones at school could also be a method for someone to communicate with someone else in school and could be, for example, a possible bomb threat. Another reason why students shouldn't have cell phones at school is because they could interrupt a class and therefore could lower their grades.

In case of an emergency, someone could use their cell phones to call the police for help. You could also call you're parents to tell them that your okay. Another good reason to have your cell phone at school is because you could call home to tell your parents to bring you what you might of forgotten at home.

There are many reasons to not have cell phones at school, but the most important of them all is cheating. Someone could use their cell to use as a calculator to cheat for their quiz or test. The worst of them all is black mailing someone and if you do it and get caught by someone, you could me in serious trouble. the reason black mailing is bad is because you could use a phone to mess with someone or take advantage of them and tell them that your going to do something if they don't do this.

I have a suggestion on the schools cell phone policy. The schools phones either don't work because they are busy, or they are not as easy as cell phones and it takes a while for the call to get through on a regular school phone. I think it would be a great idea if you would let students use their cell phones during lunch time and other free period.

One reason I think students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch first is to call their parents if they need anything. If a student forgot his lunch then the student should be able to call home and ask for a parent to bring it. Another reason students should be allowed cell phones is if they forgot a project or homework and they have not had that class yet they could call home with their cell phones. Teachers would probably not let the student call home on a school phone about homework.

Another reason why students should be able to have their cell phones turned on is if the school phones are not working. If a student needs to call home about staying after school he should be able to use his cell phone . What if the student tried to call from the school phones, then the student stayed after school and didn't have a ride home.

One last reason students should have their cell phones with them if theirs an emergency like a fire or lock down. Students would want to contact their parents and tell them what's going on. This is why students should be allowed to have their cell phones with them and they could use them during lunch time and other free periods.

I believe that we should have the second cell phone policy at school because cell phones increase the drama on school campus, they disrupt class time whenever they go off and they can be used as tools for cheating on tests.

First of all, students shouldn't have their phones at school because they increase the drama on school campus. For example students will spread abominable rumors about other students. Students will also text each other the latest gossip about the other students which distracts them from learning. Drama might still be around without cell phones but the amount of it will decrease once we get rid of cell phones from this school.

Likewise, cell phones can go off in class which disrupts the students and teachers during class. Namely, cell phones will sound their ring tones which will attract students' attention, and the teacher will have to take his/her time to tell the student to put it away. Also, students might text in class attracting their attention away from the teacher and the lesson and to their phone. This problem must be stopped before it spreads.

Furthermore, the students might even use cell phones to cheat on tests. On STAR",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
3B2C8BB36BD4,"Policy 1, kids do get distracted by their phones sometimes but that doesn't mean you should take them away completely, that will just get them to want to use it more and that means them not paying attention during class. Kids like to talk to each other if it's texting or talking face to face, and obviously face to face talking during class can be spotted fairly easily so they resort to texting. Or maybe if someone outside the school needs to get hold of them and doesn't have the schools number, then what happens? They can't answer until after school and by then it may be too late. Kids go crazy when they can't have something so just let them have it little by little, like candy.

If you take it away they'll go crazy after school and do it all then instead of doing their homework, or as I said before by using it in class. I mean with all these things that you can do on your cell phone these days like facebook, games, youtube, and of course texting, it's kind of hard not to check it during school. It's like giving us a ton of work during school and not giving us any time during school to even start it, it will pile up at home and we won't have time to do anything fun or actually get outside and play 60 like everyone is telling us to. I'm so tired of adults telling us to get off of our phones and ipods when they're on it more than we are. We know you love it so why are you taking that away from us? Kids have times worked out at home for when to be on their phone, ipod, computer, video games, or TV and when to actually do their school work. And policy 2 would just completely mess that up. Which could result in kids not doing their homework, or not getting enough sleep. Which could completely mess with their GPA, their home life, and chances of getting into a college they want.

Students do need cell phones at school at some occasions. But, phones are distracting during class and should not be allowed during classes. You should enforce Policy 1, let students bring phones to school, but make them turn the phones off during class, because if you enforce Policy 2, not let students have phones in school at all, students may need phones but won't be allowed to have them.

In times of emergency, students may need to call their parents, the police, the fire department, or other people while in school. With Policy 1, students would be able to take their phones out, turn them on and make a call. But, with Policy 2, students won't be able to make any calls and things could be very bad. Letting students use their phones during lunch or any free blocks will not hurt that student or other student's studies and should be allowed. However, students should not be allowed to use phones while in the library. The downside to Policy 1 is that students may try to use their phones during class, but you should instruct teachers to confiscate any phones that they see on during class.

I hope you agree with me on my choice of phone policies and that you do enforce Policy 1. It would help students and any other people in the school if students could use phones outside of class.

Dear Principal,

I strongly believe that students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch or any other free times. Lets say they needed something from home and they already have their phone with them, then they should be able to contact their parent or guardian if needed. I believe that it's always good to have a cell phone with you in case of emergency. Cell phones can be useful just not in class. Students could get help from other students if they needed it. What if he or she couldn't find the answer to the problem he or she was on; he or she could call or text each other to see if they have an answer. If teachers take away the cell phones from students who have them out during free time then that probably encourages them to have them during class time. Not free time or lunch. I'm feeling very ill around lunch time and I need to get a-hold of my mom or dad, so I text them to see if they're available to come and pick me up. And if they are available to do so then I'll wait in the nurses office so I know I'll be safe and that they know where I'm at. Cell phones aren't always a bad thing. They give us a chance to use our piece of technology that was created. We can communicate on them when needed. I also believe that using cell phones before or after school hours are ok. It's still free time and it's not considered school hours. We haven't officially started or ended school. Cell phones can be used as reminders. One time I had a friend who didn't know we had an honor society meeting and I texted her to remind her what was going on today at school. She took it out to read it and it had got taken away. It wasn't even time for school to begin. I was just reminding her and she got the consequence of it. I don't think it's all that fare. So in the end, I strongly believe that cell phones should be accepted during free time or and at lunch.

I think you should use policy 1 for several reasons. If someone needs a ride after school and there are no cell phones, there will be no way to communicate with your parents or get any help. Cell phones should be turned off in class though. I see many people with their phones under their desks and that is not okay. That is a distraction from getting your learning that your teacher works hard on showing you. Though cell phone use is inappropriate in class, it should be okay to use them during lunch. Lunch is your free time, you should be able to do any thing you want.

Some adults get really worked up over cell phones. They aren't a bad thing. They are amazingly useful and they are only bad when they are used in class. Cell phones are great for communicating. You can talk to someone anywhere at anytime for free. If you need help or are in a car accident, you can just use your cell phone and they will help you.

If you use policy 1 as your guide line, I expect you to not change any single word to the policy. You will expect us to not use them in class or anywhere at school other than at lunch or other free times. Thank you for reading this message and I hope you agree with me.

I believe children should be able to use and also bring there phones to school. Just for the fact if something happens on there way to school they would be able to call there parents and notify hem what happen. Or maybe after school they get kid napped and they don't got there phone what are they going to do. Like for example i bring my phone to school just in case something happens.

I don't think kids shouldn't be able to bring there phones. What if there parents needs to tell you something like come straight home. Then they would know not to stay after school. If I was the principle i would allow children to bring there phones as long as they don't use it in class. There are lots of reasons kids should be able to have phones the have calculators on them they help you do everything like check your email. Stuff like that there like a little laptop and also teachers have them why cant we.

Schools shouldn't care off of the little things. We text instead of wasting paper. Instead of going to the office to use there phones we could use are own. Its just lunch it wouldn't hurt any one its not like were in class. most kids would probably bring there phones any way I bet if they made it to were we cant bring or phones most of the kids would still bring them.

D5E8832F37DE,"Imagine you're the teacher. You're explaining the scientific method to your students, hoping that you can answer all of their questions before tomorrow's big exam. You turn toward the white board and suddenly you hear 3 soft beeps. You turn to find 3 of your students hiding cell phones behind their textbooks, carelessly texting away. If cell phones are allowed at school, this could become a daily routine. Even if the rules are to shut all phones off during class periods and only use them at lunch or free time, students can be careless and forgetful. They can sincerely forget to take their device out of their pocket, or try their best to keep it hidden. If cell phones are banned, you will see higher test and homework results, more respect, and more interaction between students.

Obviously, the student is not paying much attention at all if he/she is using their phone. This distraction can take away from important information that is needed to complete their assignments. If the students are phone-free, there is a bigger chance that they are listening to what is being said. Therefore, when it's time for them to accomplish a homework assignment or a test, the student will remember what he/she learned and will be able to apply that to the task. More attentiveness in class, more right answers.

Sometimes, teachers can bring up something relative or interesting to the students. This causes the students to respect the teacher more than they had before. When a student knows that a teacher is kind, funny, or can relate to themselves, it causes a positive, more respectful relationship. When a phone takes away from the teacher's intriguing knowledge, it can take away from the chance that that student might start to enjoy learning and being in that subject.

Nowadays, all kids do is text. Instead of actually discussing a subject face to face, they abbreviate words and sentences and send each other messages. If there are no phones in school, students can't text. This way, if they hear something interesting during a class period, students can discuss it face to face. They can even decide to call one another and plan to study or complete a project together. This not only increases the effort in student's work, but it increases the actual relationship of two friends.

As you can see, students will eventually start to realize that no phones is a positive impact on their lives. Making phone use in school against the rules will help a lot more than you and the students might have thought.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Policy 1 states that cell phones are ok during lunch and other free times but must be turned off during class time. I think I can speak for our entire school that, that is the way to go. For these reasons.

Firstly, everyone uses phones anyway and get in trouble so if it's ok then a lot more kids won't get in trouble. Meaning it won't affect there school record. Meaning they can better there education. Meaning they can design a new alternative fuel. Meaning they can change the world and it's thanks to passing this new policy.

Next, is kids want feel like there free. Look, we kids don't have many rights as it is. Our schedule is Wake up, School, homework, bed. I mean come on that's messed up. We can't access the creative side of our minds if we can't play on our phones.

Lastly , I just plainly think no phone policy is stupid. Many kids nowadays have expensive phones and if we can't use it what's the point. Most of our parents gave us the phone in order to call them if we run into trouble so if there's a fight or something going down and we don't want in then we call someone to pick us up. It's that simple.

I think that you should choose policy one. There is no harm in letting students use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free times.

It's a good way to show your students that you are willing to compromise with them. Maybe they might start behaving better if out let them use their phones during lunch or free times.

I believe it is a way better policy than the second. the second is completely disregarding anything that any students may have to say on the subject. The second policy is not compromising with anyone, and it's almost like the students are being punished. I don't think it's fair to say that they can't bring their phones to school at all. What if they need to get in touch with their parents. What are they supposed to do then. That would make things at school very complicated, you'd have students who live far away and need a ride home, or students in sports might have a game. I'm a wrestler and I'm constantly calling my father to tell him if practice is over, because practice times are unpredictable. If I wasn't allowed to bring my phone I would have no way to call my father and that would cause a lot of confusion.

Another good thing about the first policy is that students will be able to socialize and communicate. Which is an important part of society. Just to be clear even though I think policy one is good and that students should be allowed to use cell at certain times of the day, I also believe that you should be very strict on enforcing the rule of not using the phones in class. That way students will still be able to learn and still get work done instead of just socializing.

Overall I believe that policy one is the one you should choose, and I hope what I told you in this letter was helpful in making your decision.

FB1DB922DE1B,"In my opinion i believe that our principle should consider the choice on having students use their cell phones during the school day. I think it would be a good idea if our teachers or our principle give students permission to use cell phones during lunch and other free times that we have, as long as we don't use them during our class time.

One of the reasons why i think it's a good idea to consider the choice on having cell phones during school time is because there can be an emergency at home and our parent's can either text us or call us.! As long as we pay attention to our teachers during class i think it would be an awesome idea.

I think it would be dumb if our principle doesn't consider the choice to let us bring cell phones to school because either way student bring them and they still use them during class time so if our principle doesn't consider this idea it would be the same either way. But i think it would be better if she does choose to let us students use our cell phones during a free time or during lunch.

Students would use their cell phones freely without trying to hide from a teacher or an adult while using a cell phone, without believing they are getting their phone's taken away. So i really believe that our principle should really go back and think about these options. Students would be more than happy to have the permission to use their cell phone and I also believe that they wouldn't take advantage of their permission to use cell phones, but that's just my opinion on this case, other student might think different than me, so that's why i think that our principle should really think about this opinion.

I strongly believe that you should choose the first policy. One reason is that, even if you ban cell phones from school students will still be bringing them to school no matter what. Also, if there were to be an emergency in the school, I don't believe that there would be enough phones at the school to inform each parent at once. Next, cell phones wouldn't cause a problem if each student were to turn it off in class and then be able to use them at lunch.

Each student should be able to bring a cell phone to school so that they can carry it around in case of an emergency. For example, lets say that someone breaks into the school during the day and the students are in danger. There would not be enough time to call each parents, but if students were to have a cell phone they could call or send a text message to their parents telling them what's wrong. Also, if you ban cell phones, I know that there are students out there that enjoy getting in trouble, but if u were to not ban them, the students wouldn't feel the need to be a pet peeve.

Then again i strongly suggest you choose the first policy due to emergencies and the need to save yourselves from getting mad at students if they bring their cell phones to school. Please consider my suggestion and thank you for your time.

students needs their phones so they can contact their family if some thing happens or their family get robbed then how are you going to communicate. cell phones are okay but students are always texting during class when teachers are teaching. the cell phones company are starting to make new cell phones and people are starting to buy fancy phones like droid so are the students. cell phones are very cool to have and its kind of a lot of money to pay for those fancy phones. all students are buying cool phones cause they think they are cool cause other kids has cheap ones and telling them their phones are ugly. students are mean cause they could use someone's number and tell them awful stuff and would say the same thing what they say. so i say lets not have cell phones at school that would be okay to me.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

I want to talk to you about my opinion of students having cell phones at school. I really think that both of the policies have a lot of benefits, but yet can have consequences to it. It really is debate. This really depends on how student take this privilege, because some students use their phones at school even though they are not allowed to either ways.

Well, first of I all agree with both of the ideas, the good thing about having cell phones during school periods is that some kids have family emergencies and must have their phones on during school. Hey, teachers can have their phones during class and they don't have consequences. Like adults we can have a family members really sick too. come on we are humans, maybe we forgot our gym clothes in the car or at home, if we have a phone to contact our parents with and we don't use it then why do we have phones at all? A lot of members in our school have to walk home after school or after a practice, if something is wrong or something happens to us them we have our phone too call 911,some parents think that if school doesn't let phones being used in school then we shouldn't take them at all, because we are not going to use them.

But now on the other side of the story... Cell phones being used all day during school is very bad, for both teachers and students. Seriously! I have seen my friends text without even looking at the keyboard! It's scary! What I am trying to say is that teens will not focus on their class and work, they will not pay attention at all. We are the future and we must learn to make a difference. In a teens life right now the most important material thing in the world, are cell phones! Some students have very nice phones! While other people don't even have one. Students are able to steal, students distract themselves all the time and when their phones get stolen, the school is the one that gets blamed. not the student because they don't know which student out of the whole school did it.

I really don't know which side to go with, both of them have their pros and cons. Most of them have serious effects. Others just don't. So I'll leave it up to you. After all your the principal, adult and you have other perspectives as I do. You will make the right decision. Leave you to it. Later.

6957C415FEF9,"Dear Principal:

I think you should allow students to have phones at school, as long as they are turned off during class. It helps parents communicate with their children and also helps the students to gain a better social life. It is easy to turn off a cell phone, so if a student is too lazy to do so, there shall be consequences.

Parents are always trying to communicate with their kids. Which might be difficult if their kids are hardly ever at home. They may be too busy with friends or maybe at work, but parents like to know where they are, what they're doing, and who they're with. A lot of teenagers go to other friend's homes after school. It is easier to use a cell phone to ask to ride home with them on the bus rather than go home, call a parent, then try to find a ride. Teenagers appreciate the use of cell phones and so do adults. Teachers would appreciate them too if teenagers didn't text in class.

Cell phones don't only help the ability for parents to communicate with their children, they also help teenagers communicate with each other. If my friends can't find me whether at lunch or after school, they usually send me a text asking me where I am. Yes, a cell phone is a distraction in class with it buzzing in your pocket all day long, but if we turn them off then we can turn our whole attention to the teacher and the lesson. Please don't deprive us from our only way of communication.

I also think teachers should ask for the students to put their cell phones in a basket during class and for them to pick their phone up on their way out of class. It makes the teacher certain that the students are paying attention, but also allows the students to have them during free times. If a student won't put their phone in the basket, I think they should at the very least have the decency to turn them off. They don't only distract the student using the phone, it also distracts students around them. Doing these things will make catching whoever is using their cell phones easier to catch, for they will be the only ones with a phone at the time. Those who are using them, should have consequences. These consequences could vary from detentions to having the phone taken away for the remainder of the class hour.

The school should have a system that leaves the student with a warning for the first time being caught. The second time they are caught, they shall have their phone taken away for the rest of the class. Third time being caught, they will have the phone taken to the office where the will have to retrieve it after school. If they are caught again, their phone will be taken to the office where they will call their parent to tell them they need to come get it. It doesn't only get you in trouble with the school but also gets them in trouble with their parents.

I believe banning phones from being taken to school would be a mistake. We should be able to have them, as long as we don't use them. I think this new policy would make not only the students happy but also the teachers happy. Please take this letter into consideration. Thank you.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

My opinion i believe that we the students should be able to have are phones at school. I think that they should be shut of during the classes , but however at lunch the students should be aloud to use them to call parents for emergency uses. The students have the right to bring there cell phones to school it is not hurting anybody. i could understand why you are considering making the policy so that we can not have are cell phones , in some cases you may think that it is interfering with our learning but most of the students will be responsible and keep there phone in there back packs turned off.

Most of the students have to walk to and from school and some live in bad parts of town so there parents have them when they call when they get to school or when they leave from school.

CF7F36B7EA2E,"Dear Principle,

I have heard you have been considering a new cell phone policy. Cell phones at school are not only used as communication between friends but also for other reasons. Most kids do want to use cell phones for the sole purpose of communicating between friends outside and inside the classroom. However there is always the exception. There are also many other students that use their cell phones for the purpose of contacting their parents and letting them know about important information about the day.

For this reason I am suggesting accepting the first cell phone policy where students can still use their cell phones at the appropriate time.

First there are the unexpected events that occur throughout day to day. For a child who gets picked up daily by their parents, if an event occurs that restricts the parent from picking up their child that day the parent needs to contact their child and let them know about the situation. Usually the parent will call the school and have them let their child know about the change in events but the child is not always informed. Most parents will still call their child as a precaution because they want to make sure that their child is up to date about the situation.

Next there is a change in a school event that a student planned to attend. If there was an after school activity or program going on that a student planned to attend, but got changed due to various reasons, that student would need a way to contact their parent or legal guardian to come pick them up. These change in events can happen frequently due to weather, or other events that restrict the ability to have that certain event.

Lastly is for the purpose of communicating between friends. Cell phones are not an essential but can help student relieve stress and pressure from the school day. I understand about not letting them have cell phones in the classroom but there should be no problem for usage of the item outside the classroom. Many students want to have some sort of entertainment to occupy them when needed. This policy will let students have that entertainment and still focus on school work.

All in all, cell phones can be used for many different reasons during a school day. If its from unexpected events to just plain entertainment, cell phones serve a purpose in today's society. The first policy, like I have mentioned before, should be allowed due to many different reasons. I sincerely hope you can see my reasoning and make the right decision for this policy.

1DD339DE06D4,"Students don't listen when the teachers say put your cell phones up if they do they sneak and take them out and text their friends and stuff like that we understand that children having cell phones.

When a child in trouble or something they need a cell phone to call someone. When a parent give a child a cell phone they act different they don't know how to put the cell phone down students go out of hand with it they go play on people phone they bully other children.

When students have cell phones they don't how to act with cell phones they act like wide animals when they have cell phones i thought when kids have cell phones they act manure and stuff they got to act like adults when they get a cell phone. The kids get mad because they be having nasty pictures and nasty text messages and when their parents see them and they take the phone the kids be looking stupid and stuff.

Also students grades going down because of the cell phones when they get a phone they don't do nothing in school they just sit in the classrooms and talk or text on the phone that's why they grades dropping. That's why students should get a cell phone when they a little older because students like eight graders don't need to repeat the same grade over they don't need to be in middle school forever.

I think students should wait to get a cell phone because they not going to get nowhere with a cell phone but the same grade over again.

When a teacher say students can bring the cell phones the phones got to be off during class because if the teacher teaching and your phone go off that's being disrespectful to the class when the class trying to learn and that's rude when you texting while the teacher is teaching.

I think students shouldn't have cell phones ay all because that can affect the students grade and make them repeat the same grade.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

74CD1613DE1F,"Dear Principal of the school,

I'm writing you this letter to confirm which policy would be better for our school. I myself, prefer the 1st policy because it allows students some responsibility to turn of phones during class time and allowing them to have it out during free time and lunch. Some students need their phones to call parents if anything happens or if they need them to pick them up from school. If any student is caught with a phone during class time then the phone should be confiscated as a result in the consequence and be may be returned to the owner after school.

To begin with, Policy 1: allowing students to bring cell phones to school and using them during free time or lunch but turning them off during class time, would be a better choice. Some students need their phones just in case the parent needs to get a hold of them for emergencies reasons or other important reason the parent may need to call and check on their child or other reasons.

Next, students may use office phone if necessary but, there are some incidents where students need their phone in case they need to tell their parent something and the office phone is being used or isn't working at the moment. You may be worried about students having phones out during class time because that could prevent them from learning important subjects. If that is the case and the student(s) have their phones out during class time then it will lead to a consequence.

In conclusion, policy 1 would result in a lot more happiness and students will more likely obey to the rule. I may be speaking for a majority of the students that policy 1 is better for ourselves.            ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Dear Principal,

I believe that Policy 1 is a better option.

You should allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class time.

I believe this is a better option than not allowing cell phones at school at all for a few reasons.

First, cell phones are good to have in an emergency.

If something bad happened at school, it would be nice to text your parents to tell them what happened and they would feel much better to know you are safe.

Also, what if a student misses the bus, if cell phones are not allowed at school at all, than how would you be able to tell your mom to come pick you up?

Another reason why cell phones would be good to have at school would be if an after school activity was cancelled and you need to tell your parents that you will need a ride home, it would be so easy to call them from your cell phone in between classes.

There is nothing wrong with using cell phones at lunch, as long as you keep them turned off during classes.

Teachers could set rules against having them on in classes, such as taking your phone away when you are caught with it on during class.

That would help kids to follow the rules.

One more reason why cell phones are a good idea at school is that it would be nice to text your friend across the school during free time or in between classes.

For example, someone has a friend in seventh-grade across the school.

She forgot her math homework in the cafeteria.

Her friend is right by the cafeteria and is on her way over to the seventh-grade hallway.

It would be very helpful if she could text her friend to tell her to pick it up for her and save her the trip.

There are lots of benefits to being allowed to have cell phones at school.

It would make life so much easier and make many people happy.

That is why I believe Policy 1 is a better option than Policy 2.

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. If we do not bring our phones to school, then how are we going to call our parents if there is an early release at school? We always have to bring our phones in case of an emergency. As long as our phones are off during class time, then there is no problem to be arguing about it. Not allowing phones to school campus is going to be unfair to the students. What will happen if there is a fire at school and we don't have our phones to call our parents to let them know that we are okay? Is it really that serious?

CDF2746198CB,"Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you on the topic of the two possible policies you are considering regarding students having cell phones in school.

The one that I truly believe would best benefit our school is Policy 2: Not allowing cell phones in school.

This is better than Policy 1 for a number of reasons.

Did you know that 4 out of every 5 eighth graders has a cell phone?

If students were allowed to use their cell phones during free times such a lunch time those without cell phones would feel left out, excluded.

As a middle school we don't want any students feeling hat way for it could lead to stress and more serious matters.

Those that do have cell phones would make fun of these students and these distractions will likely affect all students grades as they would pay even less attention during class.

The question you are forced to ask when you deal with this topic is : What is causing these students to feel obliged to text and use their cell phones during class? Well yes they want to communicate with friends in other class and it's also fun to disobey the rules behind the teachers back.

However, the main reason is due to lack of interest in their academics.

More and more teachers are reverting to teaching methods solely based on note taking and book work.

Not only does this bore students to death but it awakens a rebellious nature within them that causes them to use their cell phones.

The method many students want learn with and will learn by is hands on experiments and class discussions.

This way students will feel more important and unique by being able to participate in class.

They will want to learn more and strive to do their best.

Although Policy 1 is a possible solution to the issue of students using their cell phones and their lack of attention during class it's just not a viable one.

Allowing them to use their cell phones during lunch and free time will have the opposite affect of what is meant of Policy 1.

Although students may continue to feel the urge to use cell phones during class after you enforce policy 2, their view on the matter will change after teaching methods are made better.

Not only will this solve the problem but it will boost student moral and grades.

Thanks for listening to my opinion.

It might cause some problems cause the would text in class. Some people will never stop using a phone and that might cause people to run into each other. If policy 2 students are not allowed to have phones at school is bad because, if something bad happens they cant call their parents or if something happens at there house there parents can call them.

We shouldn't have our cell phones on in class because it will distract you from listening to instructions. When you don't listen to instructions or what the teacher is telling you, you won't learn the material for the day. Cell Phones should only be used for emergencies only because certain teens don't know how to use during free time. For example, if you don't bring your phone to school how would your parent know if you're doing extra stuff after school. If your parents don't know then they will get worried about if you are safe or not. In some ways it's important to have a cell phone. During lunch time and free time that's the time to take out your phone because when you take it out in class when you're not supposed to, your phone gets taken away and your mad at the teacher for your mistake. If your going to have a phone just know how to use the phone in your free time and whenever an adult in school tells you to use it. Having your phone on during class is distracting because if you forgot to turn down the ring volume and it goes off in class, your phone will probably get taken away by your teacher.

Only use the phone when you need to if you are texting your parents then that's one thing if you're texting your friends you see them any way at lunch or in class.

Teens rely on cell phones for communication, making plans, and even safety. Most bring them everywhere they go, and are constantly texting or making calls. Some people do not feel right without having their phone on them or with them and they should not be blamed. This generation is becoming more reliant on technology and electronic devices. Students should be allowed to bring them to school and use them in their free time.

The policy of not having phones at school at all is not fair to students. After school or during a break, students may need to call their parents, to ask them a question or to make plans. Although a phone is provided in the office, most of the time these are occupied by others who may not have a cellular device, and if you have to ask something quickly, there is just no time. Also, some students might not know a number by heart, so if one has to call them on the school phone, they may not be able to. With a cell phone, the child would have the number saved in his/her contact list so the call is fast and easy.

Even if the policy was changed to ""no cell phones at school"", students would still sneak them in. This would make for even more of a problem because then the teachers would have to take them away and this would cause trouble. Usually, when kids get items taken away from them they feel the need to use it more, maybe just to be a rebel. If the policy was changed to ""having cell phones at breaks"" then this would not cause a issue because the student would not be interrupting any lesson.

Many teens need their phone in order to feel comfort. They rely on them for so much, then when they are taken, they do not know what to do. As time passes, our world is becoming more and more reliant on technology. Someday, this generation will look back and wonder why electronics were not used in school. We have to take advantage of what we have, not take it for granted. The rest of the society realizes how important technology is. So why not the schools? That is my question for you.

Going to school is our job as students. And that's exactly what we are here to do. But there are also many distractions such as friends, electronics, and peers. We can only limit so many things distracting us from our education. But one thing we can limit is cell phone usage. Coming from a students point of view i' m going to be very honest. As students we come to school to learn we should not be occupied by the using of cell phone devises. Yes i understand that cell phones can only be used during free time, but most kids will not obey that rule or abuse that rule.

Sitting in class bored of your mind you have two options flip out a wonderful novel or flip out your new iPhone hmmmmmmm what would you choose? We all know what most teenagers would choose, and that's your cellular devise. While we're in school we're supposed to learn but how is that possible if we are preoccupied by the latest iPhone app. How about we read a book instead. When we get home its time for fun but while in this learning facility we should be getting an education. I remember last year when we able to have our phones out in drama class and all i wanted to do was text. Every moment we would be taking pictures listening to ring tones and watching youtube videos straight from someone's new blackberry. Not knowing how this effected our grades the year pasted us by and we wondered what we actually learned in the class besides ""the jerk"".

Telling the students that they cannot have the phones on a certain times of the day is going to be a hassle. We kids already have issues trying to remember to turn off our phones in the morning. How we remember to turn it off after lunch or after any free time. How will teachers constantly remind the students to keep there phones off during class. Us kids will take advantage of having our phones on during free time and just use an excuse like ""Oh i thought this was free time."" Leave the cell phone using at home! The less distractions we have the more easier it is to learn. Let's not give us students more freedom to avoid getting an education.

TEACHER_NAME this is a big choice your going to have to make. And making the right one might not be that hard. Yes the students are going to want to have the cell phone policy changed but coming from me a student who really does care about her education. I say no, the cell phone policy is fine how it is. We students need discipline , its like giving a dog its toy and then taking it away for some parts of the day then giving it back during free time. It's called torture. If we can't have it all day then don't give it to us at all.

I think that you should consider policy #1 because you may never know what may happen to a student in case of an emergency.

I think that you as a principal should allow the students to bring their phones to school just as long as they don't use it during the class while a teacher or professor is teaching a lesson. But since you are the principal of the school, I think that you should bring up a meeting with the teachers of the school first and let them know about the school policy and what it is that is going on. Afterwards, I think that you should bring up the topic to the students and let them know about the school policy but leaving them off with a warning. If they brake the school policy, then you have the right to go for policy #2, not allowing them to bring their phones to school.

Or when i' m in my language arts class my teacher lets me use our ipods for writing to help us concentrate more. It really does help me i do like it, it gives me time to think but also have music going on, or to give me more of an idea like one song could help me set the mood to the subject i' m writing about or give me more of an idea about it.

Most school's in America are banning phones from school's, because there using them to take pictures of people or video's of students. I hate that most kids now and day's are using them for bad things, or just to get a laugh out of something that's really not even that funny. When it could really hurt someone's feelings, it would be a whole lot better if they were banned. But it still wouldn't be fair for the kids who don't use them in bad ways and just for texting or other such necessary things.

I hope you do improve this idea, and think more about it. And that this is enough information to convince you too like the idea. It would be nice to have phone's in our school, and still be able to use them.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Allowing students to have cell phones at school could provide an unproductive learning environment. If students are allowed to have cell phones, they could take advantage of it and use them as distractions. Also, they could get stolen or broken and then provide a lot of trouble for the school. Therefore, I believe that the school should adopt a no cell phone policy.

If students were given the ability to have cell phones at school, they would then take them and use them during class as well. For instance, they might use it to text their friends or cheat on a test. This would provide a distraction from their learning that could cause them to suffer in the future. Also, many new cell phones have calculators on them which could in turn be used on a math test or quiz as an act of academic dishonesty. As a result the ability to carry cell phones at school would prove to be an unwise decision.

In a case in which a cell phone were stolen or broken, it could provide a problem for the student as well as the school. If you brought a cell phone to school and it was stolen for some reason, it would cause a huge disruption. For example, the student's parents would probably be unhappy and then go and talk to the school about it. This would then cause a problem for the school and the person who stole the cell phone. Therefore, in the case of this event it would be easier just to leave the cell phone at home.

Lastly, a cell phone could be used to discompose others. For example, if a person did not have a cell phone, someone else might then have reason to aggravate them or put them down. This could then cause a drop in their self esteem and prove to be very hurtful. In a similar scenario, a student might use a cell phone to upset someone else by texting or spreading rumors about others. As a result, not being able to have cell phones at school could prevent events such as this, and provide a more supportive and encouraging environment.

Although some may argue that they need cell phones to contact their parents in the event of an emergency, the school would be able to provide a phone in the office that would be open to all students. Therefore, there is no case in which a cell phone would be crucial to have. Because of the distraction and complications that cell phones could cause, they should not be allowed on the school campus.

Having cell phones at school would be a good idea.

They would be a good idea because if you don't allow to have phones at school then they might get hurt by someone.

If she or he was too be walking home or riding a bike home then how would they be able too call for help if they were attacked.

Plus it would make students happier.

If the students are happier then they would want to do there work more and more.

Then it would just be a cycle of events accruing in our school.

If you gave them the opportunity to have phones then they would respect you more as a person.

There wouldn't be any issues with phones being out at the wrong time if you just have an assembly and set the ground rules so they.

Next if you need your home work that you left at home then you can just text your mom in the morning.

This would prevent you from getting a bad grade.

Also if you forget your lunch then you don't have stave.

You can just call your dad or mom to come bring it to you.

And if you are hungry then your not going to be focused on what your doing in class.

Then the teacher will be mad at the student and then you would have to deal with them.

Over all that would just make your job harder.

Then if your job is harder you will start aging faster and faster until you just lose your mind.

Then you'll start to get a divorce and your life will start spiraling down and down until you hit rock bottom.

As i was saying i think having students to be able to have phones at school would be great and benefit all of us.

will you allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. It may help other students to do there work by like listening to music the music you like and that's it. Not to text people during class time or while walking up and down the hallways or talk bad on your phone while you have free times or text somebody bad names during free times. Make sure that your phone is turned off during class time. Don't have dirty pictures on your phone and showing then to other students while you have a free time. Or it will be taken up for about two days or if your phone is on during class period or your on your phone during class period it will be taken up for three days or less. It might help you on things you need help on or you can call a friend for help see it will help students.

After reviewing the possible cell phone policies I have come to a conclusion that I support Policy 1. This policy allows students to use their cell phones for important or recreational uses that do not distract them during class time. Also with this policy they will be able to set up transportation and be able to feel secure in case of an emergency.

Policy 2 however, I feel will be ineffective and will not aide students in any way. If this policy is chosen students will most likely still bring their cell phones to school and because of the fact that they are not allowed to use them in free time they will most likely have to use them secretly during class. This will distract not only themselves but students around them. Also they may feel almost ""dared"" to bring their cell phones and try not to get caught.

The reason I feel that Policy 1 would be helpful is because if they are given certain periods of time when they can use them without having to face getting into trouble, the students will feel their is no need to use them during class. This will help them keep focussed during class along with others around them. Also they will be able to keep in touch and check in with their parents or guardians in case of an emergency or and important occurrence.

One of the main reasons students bring or even have cell phones today is for transportation purposes. If students are given a time during lunch or free time to use their cell phones and do this it will cut out the need to bring cell phones into the classroom or anywhere else in the school.

I believe that students will support this policy and respect the rules of it. If Policy 2 is put into play I believe students will take it lightly and not follow the rules. Also they may not feel as safe or secure in their school environment. In all, I believe that Policy 1 will help benefit not only the students but teachers as well and help the school environment become a more safe, secure, and focussed environment.

I am a kid who loves my phone. It would be a great idea to let students use phones during lunch and other free times. Students rely on their phones for many different reasons. An example would be texting and calling, this is important for a good social life at school. If a student lets say, forgot his lunch, he should be able to call his parents to bring him/her one.

Normally phones must be off during class to not distract another students learning. If a phone did go off in class, it should be taken away and given back after class. Otherwise, this idea is fantastic. This would make lives at school easier for students to communicate. Say perhaps a student was sick and wanted a parent or other family to pick him/her up from school. Wouldn't you think that it would be fun to have phones allowed at school? Don't teachers have to communicate also? Ask yourself these questions, wouldn't it make you feel good that your students are happy with school?

I would be happy with school if this happened, and all the other kids would be too.

But honestly what is this going to hurt teacher and staff have phones during the school why can't we anyways lunch is a social period.

Really I think that lunch should be extended to an hour because teens like to socialize and were not getting enough time to our self because this is ridiculous 30 minutes to our self we barely have enough time to eat its insane that we really have no social time.

But yet teachers wonder why we are so talkative in class this is my conclusion to this solution to the talking in class solution to the texting in class solution.

Have to know what is going on and what happened because that is not there problem to worry about and plus if you tell the teacher what happened it will get around the school some how . Because there are teacher pets in school and so they will tell there friends and that is why i think that the principal should let the school use are phones and think about this what if something goes wrong and there is not a teacher around you will have your phone to call for help. But then the kid will want to text in class so then I can see why to but i would be more happy if the principal let us use are phones in school hours.

I think having cell phones are not beneficial because it distracts kids minds from what the real communication is in reality and that's face to face. Many kids get distracted from schoolwork or very important things and blow it off just because they want to text someone.

Kids keep getting in trouble in school for texting in class so why not ban the? It also keeps teens away from educational purposes like texting instead of reading.

Moreover, I believe it brainwashes the teens to be less active or energized. It also leads to cyber bullying and many other consequences. The most important thing of all is that it keeps them away from their future. Education is everything in our future. It is our water in our plants and is the roar of a lion. If success is what you are planning towards these teens, then you must take away their privilege of using cell phones on school grounds. They will soon realize its for their own good and will starting running towards a successful future.

Many say that it is a way of communication, but talking twenty four hours a day is a waste of time and its a waste of success. I know you have your freedom, but I suggest to think of the future and where these teens are going to end up as. We want America to be a proud and successful nation, so why not start small with minor problems with too much use of cell phones.

In conclusion, I believe to a better start in a united is to make the next generation successful. You will soon agree how these kids will change in a more mature and mannered citizens they turn out to be. One little thing can do a lot.

BABDE6C6C7B9,"As a student i believe phones are helpful. A reason why i think this is because when there is an event at school we would like to stay for we can call our parents to tell them, without having to go to the office. Another reason why I think cell phones are helpful, is that if there is an emergency you can call almost anyone you need to. Though cell phones can be a distraction they are more useful then anything else. I think all students from sixth grade up should have a cell phone. They are very handy \and have a lot of tools on them. An example of tools that cell phones have are: calculator, alarm clock, stop watch, e-z tip calculator and many more helpful tools. If a student brings out a cell phone in class a teacher should have the authority to take it away. Policy two is better in my opinion because a student should have the right to bring it to school. But if it is interfering with this students learning a teacher or principle can confiscate it.

The defects of letting a student bring a phone to school is that if he/she was to use the cell phone in class it will disrupt the learning of this student and others. Another reason why it is a bad idea is that a student can video tape or take a picture of an embarrassing event that happened about another student. One student can record voice of another to hold against them. Phones these days are so high tech that you can access internet on your phone without using the schools wifi. If a student has a phone like that he/she can browse the internet during class as well for answers if he/she needed it. Over all in my opinion cell phones are more of a help then a bad idea.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
7C22432ACEED,"I am in favor of policy number one. Being a teenager I enjoy using my cell phone. And are we really hurting anyone by using our phones during lunch or free time? I didn't think so. Not being able to bring our phones at all could actually be a safety hazard . What if a child, who has breathing issues, needs their medicine, and they left it at home? What if that same child didn't have their parents' numbers memorized? How would that child be able to contact their parents?

Now, people break the rules all the time. If an adult tells a teen not to do something what do you think we're going to do? That's right the exact opposite. We aren't stupid, we know what's good and bad. But we hate being told what to do. And isn't being told what to do and when to do it a form of bullying? Yes it is. If we are allowed to use our cell phones when we aren't in our classes there wouldn't be a problem. If we aren't allowed to use them, we'll just break the rule and do it anyway. I know it sounds bad, but it's true. No matter what the rules are, us teenagers will use our phones.

Can't we just use our phones without worrying that we'll be suspended or put in detention? Why is it such a big deal if we use our phones anyway. Teachers use them all the time. Just last week my substitute for history spent the entire class time texting his girlfriend. If we can't use our phones, why can the teachers? My history teacher, TEACHER_NAME, is always talking about equal rights, fair treatment, and how everyone should follow the same set of rules. But halfway into the class her phone would ring, and she would be texting or talking for the rest of the class time. The teachers don't follow the rules, so why should we? The teachers always have their phones out. Why can't we? We're teens, we will use our phones. Saying we can or can't, won't make a difference.

I agree with policy one, which states that students would be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. This is the better policy because it would make students more happy and able to have their free time to the maximum. I think that if you went with policy two then students would be very unhappy.

One reason why you should use policy one is because students would support you more because they would be happy and would agree with more of your decisions. Like if you decided to change another rule then students would not be afraid to state their opinion.

Another reason is that instead of not liking school then students would want to come to school because they would get to have more fun. Their free time would be filled with more excitement and the students would be happier. I'm pretty sure you want happy students at your school right?

A third reason is that students would be more connected at school than they were before. Teachers and administrators are always saying that we need to be more connected because we are eighth graders going into high school next year. This would make us students even more connected than we already are.

In conclusion, I agree with policy one because it would make students happier and be able to fulfill their free time to the maximum. I think that policy two would make students unhappy and they wouldn't want to come to school as much.

Are u sure u want kids to be able to use their cell phones? I think that kids should not be allowed to use their cell phones because, many kids don't really follow the rules. They'll still be using their cell phones during class. They wont just use then when they are told they can. they'll rebel using their phones during class.

To begin with, students don't follow the rules. Many kids in school don't pay attention and do what ever they fell like doing. They do a lot of things to just have fun. they don't care what happens.

They do what their friends say and not care what anyone else says.

they would just brake the rules and be using their phones during class.

let me explain further. Kids cheat using their cell phones. During tests they can text their friend aski8ng them for answers. This isn't good because, the teaches won't know what they know and won't be able to help us learn what we need to learn. This is a bad way a life for the students.

lastly, they don't really need their cell phones at school. Kids just use them to talk with their friends. They don't really use them for energies. Cell phone are just toys they use. If cell phones where used for emergencies then it would be different.

overall, kids having cell phones at school isn't necessary. kids can live without having them at school. kids could just wait until they get home to call their friends. Cell phones should be allowed for many other reasons too.

I think that we should have policy number one. All student should be ably to use there phones in their free time & in lunch. Its better to have them off in class time. Because if we don't then the student wouldn't learn. They should be turn off or it should be low. Some student would really like this idea about using phones in there free time. There some student who don't like to go to lunch or like to eat and by using there phone they have something to do.

The teacher get mad when there standing up by having there phone i don't think they will be. Most kids use there phone in school when the teacher don't look so its better to have the rule about only in free time.

By having this rule i think it will make kids be better because if there not then they will not be ably to use there phones. That what most kids like and want to be ably to use there phone in school. Not all kids have phones so to make it far for everyone the rule should be phones and ipods only in there free time .Think this would work good as a rule but we need to try it first. In high school you can use it so why not middle school. Kids should start see how it work with the phones in high school. So they can have in idea about it. But not everyone is going to think how i do but i think we should try it for a week or two to see if it works. But think that policy number one is a good one and a good idea.

We never now if we don't try. We should try if it work we keep it if it doesn't then we just say it didn't. But we can say at least we tried. For some student it will work good but for some it wont. Some will have hard time with it but other wont. Most student do there homework when there testing and do good in there class.

Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I believe that cell phones should not be allowed in school because of the fact that students will be tempted to text in class this has happened in school before. The seventh grade class had two students texting in class with out looking in the desk.

The policy here now is that if you bring your cell phone to school is that you have to give it to the teacher and wait till the day is over. This is why cell phones should not be allowed in school it leads to disruption of a class lesson. I f were to have a say in this i would do some thing about this.

If i could i would take all the cell phones in the school and lock them in a safe and never take them out not even my cell phone would be taken out. this way you can get your work done in class and not be disturbed at all during the lesson and i will be a lot more focused on my work and be at peace with my self.

This will help raise grades and improve test scores all over the nation and we will be able to compete with nations like Japan and China.

This will raise our test grades by ten percent and we will lose the current reputation that we as the city of Bridgeport have as a low grade school city.

You know how these texting in class and calling and being not responsible... Well I think that policy 2 is the best policy. This reason is because students can be more focused on their work more than phones , students want be distracting other kids , and most importantly is that they need to have a good GED when they get in high school. I think we should have a election. I know back in a few grades I used to text and everything but I have learned my lesson. I have had bad grades and you don't want that. But the main thing im trying to get to here is that, texting should not be allowed in class like what policy two said. I think that is jus plain dumb. Im just trying to persuade you to not let texting go on during class. Also im conserned about my other class mates.

I think that we should have a cell phone policy that lets us have our phones at school. I do not think we should be able to use them in class, because it would distract us from our work, but if you let us use them at lunch and during brakes that would be awesome.

I think we should be able to have our cell phones at school because of emergencies! What if my mom or dad has to work late tonight and I have nowhere to go, because I don't like to be home alone at night. I also think we should be able to have phones during lunch because its not hurting anything if we do. If someone's phone gets stolen or broke, its their own fault. What if one of my family members are sick and they had to go to the hospital? I would not find out till I got out of school.

Most of the kids in our class have their phones our or at least keep them on them at all times anyway. You could walk into our class and see at least one person with there phone out.

If we were allowed to have our phones we would not have to hide from the teacher if it accidentally goes off in class. Most teachers are okay with it, and just tell you to turn it off put it on silent. But then you have other teachers that freak out when a phone goes off and takes it to you.

First, let me start by saying this are school are one of the lowest schools that have low test grades because of phones. Phones in school is a bad idea because when students are in class they don't pay any attention to the class assignments they worry about when there going to get there next text or phone call. I had went to go check out most of these students grades and most of them are failing because there phones are always turn on like for example a student name RELATIVE_NAME

was in class taking a test he wasn't doing his test he was on the phone texting we seriously need to do some thing.

Second, lack of participation is one of the biggest problem in school if nobody want to do any work what's the point of coming to school. Principal TEACHER_NAME participation put point on your current grade if more student participate they have a chance increasing there grade to something higher. Students don't understand that were trying to get them to success if more students can participate i guarantee you this the school test scores will increase. memorial middle school increase there test scores cause of participation and i know we can do it too

Third, most importantly fight are occurring fast at this school a lot of students are getting suspended because, of phone drama that are in school they text when and where there going to fight and that i can not have any violence on this school campus. A lot of students are getting arrested for battery or physical battery i want theses student to learn not to fight cause of what some one else think of her if we can take those phone away i guarantee this school would be the best school in the county for example one of the students just got into a fight because of a phone over a phone are you kidding me.

Many kids all over the country talk on cell phones. We use them to communicate with one another. We also use cell phones for emergencies. For example if are out with your friends and you need to talk with one of your parents what do u do? You call them or text them. All though you can use them for urgent cares, students at school and adults at work can get distracted bye a cell phone.

Policy one states, students are allowed to bring cell phones to school and only use them during lunch and passing period but phones have to be turned off during class time. Policy two states, students are not allowed to have cell phones at all. Policy two is a better choice because have a cell phone can be extremely distracting to students and maybe even teachers. School is a department of education to learn new things and life long skills. Students also might get hurt texting on a phone they will be to busy to pay attention to a flight of stairs two steps away. If you decide policy one you might have complaints about cell phones ringing during the middle of class which does not just alarm the owner but also the rest of the class.

NO student should bring there cell phone to school because what if it gets stolen or your best friend knows your combination to your locker and just so happen to take it or maybe even give it to someone else. Who fault is that for bringing it to school, who fault is it that giving your locker combination to someone else?

You may think that it is okay to have it on you at school, but the minute it gets tooken up by one of your teachers or they see the imprint in your pocket and take it, you want to get mad huff and puff and be angry for something that you did. Its not time to text your friends in class and ask them what there doing. Its time for you to learn and not be worried about what other people are doing. Get off that phone sometimes and do your school work. Your phone is not important at school your school work is.

There trying to teach you about things that you need to know, but instead your worried about who's texting you. Most students don't need to be worried about that do your school work and be thankful that you even have someone to teach you things.

So i go with reason two if why students shouldn't have there cell phones at school. At home is where it should be and not in your pocket or in your locker. Once you get home them maybe you can have it. But Students are not focused on there school work, there always worried about mess at school he say she say things that don't concern school. That's how things get started school but electronics and the main thing is you cell phone. So again students SHOULD NOT be able to have there cell phones at school.

I honestly think we should be able to bring our phones to school but only to use them for emergencies only. But i mean it would be nice to be able to use our phones during school hours but yet during free time and lunch time. I think if we were really able to use phones in school it would never be a bore in school what so ever. But some students in school have serious lack of concentration and being able to use phones in school would make it even more worse than it already is. So i mean of course I'm going to choose policy 1 because what teenager do you know that wouldn't want to bring their cell phones to school and actually be able to use it during school hours.

Because as you can see in the video even if were not allowed to use our phones there are some that tend to use it anyway. Even while the teacher is teaching but most uses books to cover up their phones or wait until the teacher isn't looking or walking down the hall. I mean cell phones are really like teens drugs you can really get attached to it or just cant help yourself and you really have to text that person back. But me personally I don't really use my phone in school i might wait until gym while were in the locker rooms to text them back. But I'm not going to text during class unless its my mom and its really important and that's when i might just lift my book up and text away but other than that i keep my phone either in my book bag or my pocket.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
CA3937072A24,"I think that policy 1 is the better choice, because the students are going to bring their phones to school no matter what. If you let us bring our phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free periods the students wouldn't have to sneak around and text people during class. Some people might take advantage of this and use the phones all day long but, you would just have to punish them and let the rest of us use them in free periods. The school will then get more respect and the teachers could teach their class without any distractions and cellular devices going off in class. If you would consider that policy the students would admire you in ways you can` t seem to understand. Giving students the opportunity to carry their cellular devices is giving them responsibility and telling them that you can trust them to do the right things in class and pay attention to the class.

To prevent the students from texting in class the teachers should also put bens or cubbies to hold all cellular devices. That would restrain the students to look at texts from their friends. If you tell students not to bring their cellular devices to school they are going to bring them any way or the other just to see what you are going to do about it. The mind of a teenager is if you tell us not to do something we are going to do it anyways just to see what's going to happen if we do it. If nothing happens we will continuously keep doing it and will eventually start using the phones in class and wherever we want and when we want to.

Allowing students to have their phones during free times but have them turned off during class time, would be the best choice.

I think that the principal should choose policy A because the parent might need to get a-hold of the student during school for something extremely important, the student will most likely use their cell phone less during class from using it in their free periods, and there is no use not letting the student use their cell phone during a free period if they're not doing anything to begin with. These are some reasons why I think the principal should go with policy A.

First, the parent might need to get a-hold of the student during school for something extremely important. Something could have come up like a death or odd news. Another example would be that the student could have left something at home and they decide to text one of their parents to bring it to school for them. One more example would be that there is an unexpected club meeting of some sort that came up that day, so the student should be able to text one of their parents during the free period to let them know that they will be home late and give them a heads up notice. This is one reason why I think the principal should go with policy A.

Second, by letting students use their phones during lunch and free periods, that would give them the chance to just do something for fun and to get using their phones out of their system. It would let them have their time with there phone, so they wouldn't use it during class. It this manner, it is being both fair to the teacher, and fair to the student. Everybody gets their way. Yes, I think it is incredibly rude for a student to use their phone instead of listening to the teacher, but I also think it is unfair for the student to not have any person freedom during class. This is another reason why I think the principal should go with policy A.

Last but not least, I think that the principal should go with policy A because if the student has a free period, and they can do absolutely anything they want to, why not let them use their phones? There's no real harm in it. If they had a free period and had nothing to do because they forgot their book or already finished their homework, whatever the case me be, they should be able to use their phones to text or to just have fun. This is my last reason why I think the principal should go with policy A.

To sum up, I think the principal should go with policy A because the parent may need to get a-hold with the student for something extremely important, the student will most likely use their cell phone less during class from using it in their free periods, and there is no use not letting the student use their cell phone during a free period if they're not doing anything to begin with.

I think you should go with policy 1. I think if you allowed students to have there cell phones during lunch and other free times would allow them to make important phone calls to parents or send texts to parents about certain things. Some days they may need something they don't have and there to far from the office so they would pull out there cell phones to call and ask or get there parents to bring them something, and they shouldn't be able to get there phones token up in the process of doing that.

All students in the school would agree that if there class was on the opposite of the school they wouldn't want to walk all the way to the office just to tell their parents that something wrong happened. Now on the other hand they could use them to make phone calls to friends. they could tell their friends to save seats at lunch and they could tell their friends that they need them a. s. a. p for some strange emergency. Instead of having to go walk around the school in a rush trying to find that friend and trying not to be late they could text or call on the way to their next class.

Kids all ways make up little excuses during break to go call at the office complaining there ""sick"" and going to the nurse saying they don't ""feel good."" Well news flash the office would send them to the nurse and the nurse doesn't have time for little faker's. So in the hall if they fell ""sick"" they can call or text whoever they live with to come get them.

So now that you see my side and most of the other students story I hope you understand that i'm speaking for all kids in the school.

I believe that the best cell phone policy is to allow students to have phone in school and allow them to use them during lunch periods and other free periods, so long as the phone are turned off during class time. Cell phones have become a near irreplaceable part of teens' lives today. The ability to be able to contact people at any place and moment in time is extremely important, to the point of being vital. For example, in case of an emergency, students would be able to contact their parents and the other people they would need to inform. Without this luxury- no, necessity- lives could be endangered. Moreover, students would be happier during school because they would be allowed to use their cell phones- at the right time, of course. Thus, students would have a more positive attitude during class, would work harder, and obtain better grades.

Now, i understand why cell phones are generally not accepted in classrooms. cell phones can be distracting in class; you can talk, text message, and IM friends; you can play games or use the internet. With all of the things you can do with that one machine, it's no wonder that cell phones are deemed a distraction in classrooms. However, if cell phones were permitted to be used during lunch periods and other free periods, I assure you that students' cell phones would not be a distraction during class time any longer. If cell phones were allowed to be used in class, the temptation to use them in class would no longer exist. The reason for that is people always want what they can't have. In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain says that in order to make something desirable to someone, you must make it difficult to obtain. Since it would not be difficult to use cell phones, there would not be a need to have them banned in class- and banning cell phones in class would cause cell phone usage to go up.

I hope that you consider changing the school's cell phone policy to be more lenient about cell phone usage, which would in turn give the school a more student-friendly environment.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Cell phones are a necessity for us. We need them in case something happens to us, we could call our parents right away or if we just want to keep in contact with our friends, but ye they should be turned off during school ours except during lunch. We should be able to use them during lunch and at free times, as we are doing now. If students are caught texting during class take their phone away, and punish them like calling their parents and letting them know that their student isn't obeying the policy.

Granted, there are a lot of students being caught using their cell phones when they're not supposed to, but the innocent students are obeying the policy and shouldn't be punished along with the other students. Cell phones are also a good way to get things around quickly. Like if there's going to be a test the next day and a student was absent, their friend could text them during lunch and the student could try their best to be there the next day. Cell phones are also a good way for you to contact the student if you need them. For example during a field trip, say the student can't be found. What do you do? You can call them on their cell phone and find them easily.

Cell phones can be a nuisance item, but they are helpful. Just make sure that the students disobeying your policy don't do it any longer; by calling their parents or taking away the phone and have their parent come get it. As you're doing now.

I would recommend using ''Policy 1'',because students bring their phone to school anyways.

If you do allow students to use their phone at school at free times they would like school a lot more. Especially teens they would love the fact that they can use their phones at school during a free time. A lot of students today get in trouble for bringing their phone to school.

There are some good reasons for students to bring their phones to school. Here's three examples, example one, they might for get their gym clothes, so they'll wait until a free time to call their parents to drop their clothes off. Example two, a student might get hurt at school and no one is around, all they'll have to do is pull out their cell phones and call their parents . Example three, A student might stay after school for tryout's or something and didn't tell their parents. Instead of having their parent worried sick about them they can call them and tell them where they are.

If you use policy 2 students will bring them anyways. The more trouble students get in , the more work you'll have to do. So let them bring there phones to school. They'll love it! If you do allow them to bring there phones to school they'll text there friends and tell them about it, Then there friends are going to move to your school. The more students you have at your school the better. So please let your students take there phones to school.

I think that bring your phone to school and using them at lunch, break and other free times is a good idea. Because as long as they turn it off at the end of the time giving then there should be no problem. I know you probably think that people would go behind your back and leave there phones on but if they do and they get caught they should get in trouble for it. I really don't see a problem with taken your phone to school and using it at free time.

Also, if they don't obey the rules then they can pay the consequences.

Using phones at school is not no big deal if you think about it. Because we have eight hour in school and I think it is right if you let us use it when free time is giving to us, but not during class time. I know school means a lot but i still think we should get a free time and let us check our phones. School is not a joke, it is important i know that, but i bet you over half of the school checks there phones when they can.

In all, i think students should be allowed to use there phones when they have free time. Education is very important, but remember we have eight hours in school and I don't see any problem checking them at lunch, break or free time. i don't think its right sneaking behind your back and people trying to check there phone so instead of them going behind your back the free time giving to them they can check it.

I think you should us kids have our phones and use them during school. The reason i think should phones in school is because, we like using our phone all day. But if we atleast get the privilege of using the phone during our free time we wouldn't be interested in our phones during class. We like to communicate at all times. Atleast we would have like 30min out of our whole lunch time. I agree it is also a bad idea to have phones in school because it distracts us from our school work but we also deserve that privilege.

I don't think having no phones in school is a good well thought idea. The reason i think why is because kids would just be doing the same there doing now. They would sneak in there phones to school and use the phones during classes. I also think it would just make some think it would be making it worse, therefore our grades will drop over a few text messages.

I do think some of use will follow the rule of having our phones off during class time because we get the freedom of using i during lunch. So we would get bored of our phone's once we get to go to class that we wouldn't have the need to use our phone's.

I think that the second policy is better because students shouldn't have phones during class or on free time. Cell phones are going to take learning away from students if they have there phones with them all the time. If we come to school to learn then why should we have our cell phones with us?! I think cell phones during school is going to be bad because it will take away a lot of learning that we need in our life.

School is very important because school will help you get a great job we you get older. If all the kids have a cell phone with them at school then there's going to be less education in there life because they are not dong what they are suppose to be doing, they are texting or calling when they are suppose to be doing there work and learning about history or math. To keep kids focus they shouldn't bring there phones to school or if they do bring there phones to school then give it to the office or your teacher to hold on to it until school its over.

I feel that if you let the students bring there cell phones to school it could start something or bring trouble. Students will be very off task when they should be focus on getting their work done and not bringing it all home and not doing there work. Cell phones should be used outside of school and not during school. If you let the students bring cell phones to school then your taking there education away from them. If students start to fail because they are not doing what they are suppose to be doing then you are going to look bad because your students are failing from being unfocused.

Yes kids bring phones to school when they are not suppose to but not all of them use it during class. They only bring there phones for when school is over and if they need to call there mom or dad. I only bring my phone so that if something bad were to happening after school when i am walking home or if i need to call for a question i have my cell phone. I have never used my phone during school because it is going to get me off task. I want to have an education and have a great job when i get older and so do other students but if you let them bring there phones then its going to get them very unfocused and off task.

I hope that you will keep cell phones from use in school. I know that students will be mad at first but they will see when you let them bring there phones how unfocused it is during school. Kids have a lot of things going on in there life and when they have a cell phone i bet they talk about how they feel to there friends.

Cell phones are the thorn in the side of teachers and other school officials. They pop up in class, at lunch, in the library, and of course in the hallway. They're everywhere, there's no way you can enforce a no cell phone policy. You can not find every abuser and when they don't get caught, it encourages them to do it again. However if you give students a tiny amount of cell phone freedom, I am positive they will be less likely to text during math class.

Allowing cell phone use during free time can be used no just for personal use, but for educational use as well. There is an app on the i phone that allows you to make flash cards.

studying on the i touch is much more appealing than flipping pieces of paper. Technology can encourage students study and to do more to ace that English test they have. If there is any way to help students learn I believe we should use it.

Emergencies aren't planned, that's why we call them emergencies. So why take away what could be a student's last chance in an emergency? We all know that the school phone lines can get backed up pretty bad and sometimes there is no time to waste. If your parents had a car accident and they are trying to call you, you would want to have a cell phone. If you are being forced to do something or you have seen someone you know doing something at school that is illegal or dangerous, you need to have a connection to the school. A cell phone is that connection. Don't you think that students need that extra line of protection?

I think it's extremely worthwhile to have safety just a call away.

Having a no cell phone policy at all sounds like a great plan and no doubt it would be, if there was any way to control rules like that. Students will find a way to use their cell phones no matter what you tell them. Under jackets, books, and desks , a teacher can't catch them all. Each one that doesn't get caught encourages another to do the same thing. Even with dire consequences there is no way to ensure public obedience. Giving students a taste of freedom helps satisfy their longing. They won't yearn to use their cell phones if they just finished texting during the last locker stop. To get anything you have to learn to compromise, give a little take a little.

As you can see because of countless reasons a cell phone policy including allowance at free time is clearly the right choice. It's the only way to go to get the most out of what you want. Sure, there will be some times when the policy is ignored by students, but it will happen less than it would with a no cell phone plan policy. Help your students continue to learn and smile the way they need to in order to grow up smart and happy. Use this cell phone plan and watch the results with your very own eyes, I'm positive you won't believe them.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8

Students in every day life go to school and use their cell phones. It may be during class or in between. The students have been sneaking it around because it is not allowed. This shouldn't go on for long. It's time to put a stop to it. Students are more focused on the phones and not their work. They are also focused on not getting caught by and adult staff, such as the teacher or the principal, etc. Therefore the policy I consider would be a good idea would be Policy 1. This is all because they don't get the time to use their phones at school. The Policy I consider would be Policy 1 to be the most reasonable for this situation.

I consider Policy 2 to be the most reasonable for this occasion because it allows students to know that they have time to have use of their phones at a certain time during school. It is a good idea because then students probably would not get so distracted. Since students are hiding their phones during class they don't do their work because that is what their focused on. In my opinion mobile phones is one of the technology used. Therefore texting is one of the most things teens now a days do. During any time period of the day. I think that if students were actually given a chance they would stop doing the wrong things and pay more attention in class. Policy 2 would probably be the best choice. It sure is a choice i recommend. It's only allowed during lunch periods and during free times. Not during class, they shall be checked when entering the classed room for the phones to be turned off.

There are many reasons one might support these two very different policies, but it is clear that one must be chose. I was thinking that if you had an opinion from a student's point of view, it might help you make a decision.

I for one think that students do not need to have phones in schools at all. If they need a phone during the school day, they can ask a teacher or go to the office. They do not need to have a phone with them all the time and if they are allowed to do so, they may become dependent on it and be more tempted to use it in class.

Students are already not allowed to have phones with them in class, yet they still keep them in their pockets, and often times use them. If they are actually allowed to have their phones with them, it is more likely that they will break the rules.

I'm sure many students would not like the idea of not having their phones with them all the time and would absolutely love that they would be able to use them at lunch and free periods, but I still think it is completely unnecessary. There is no need to have your phones with you when you can simply ask to use the teacher's or the office phone. If students were allowed to use their phones during school, it would only be a distraction to their learning, and therefore a nuisance in the building.

The main purpose in school is to learn and prepare students for adult life, but if students are more interested in socializing, it could create large consequences in the future.

Phones can be very beneficial in some circumstances, but school is not one of them. In school, students would be more likely to cheat with their phones, making it easier to get answers from other students.

Though the majority of the students that attend our school would strongly support Policy 1, they most likely are supporting it for all of the wrong reasons. Policy 2 is clearly the right choice to make. There is absolutely no reason what so ever why students can not go eight hours with out sending a text to a friend when they can simply tell them in person. As said before, there is also no reason why a student could not make a phone call using the office or a teacher's phone.

All I ask is that you take my reasons for enforcing Policy 2 into consideration and make the right choice for our school.

Kids love their phones. in fact they love it so much that they think their life's practically revolve around their phones.

For this reason, I believe that you should not allow kids to have phones at school at all. My reason for saying so is because, some kids are disobedient and they do not listen to rules, hence ""turn off during class time"". Also, phones causes distractions, and lastly because phones can also lead to violence. For these very reasons phones should be banned from all schools.

I believe phones shouldn't be allowed in school because kids are disobedient and don't listen to rules. Although, in Policy 1 it states ""use them during lunch and free periods as long as phones are turned off during class time"" I believe that students will take advantage of the situation and continue to use their phones during class time. If my school allowed me to use my phone during school I wouldn't turn my phone off just because a lesson is going on. I would continue to text my friend or whom ever it may be that I am texting and while I am doing so, I would be losing learning time and missing important information that I will need in the future, which brings me to my next point:

Phones are big distractions for students and teachers as well. Allowing students to bring phones to school for them, basically gives them the opportunity to use their phones whenever they want to and they miss out on class work and notes, which might eventually lead to failure and decreasing of the students grades. When someone calls or texts a phone the hone makes noise whether it is vibrations or loud ring tones. These ring tones and vibrations appear as distractions for their peers so not only does it effect just that one student but the whole class as well. In my opinion, if you allow students to bring phones to school, their grades, and participation grades will decrease, because all focus will be gone, and more students will fail or even have to got to summer school. All because of a device that they were allowed to bring to school.

My last reason that phones shouldn't be allowed in schools is because phones can link to violence. For instant, not all people have nice phones, or even phones at all, because of this students phones might get stolen, or misplaced. If the student was ever to find out to whom took the phone he/she might get into an altercation with the other person, which ,may eventually lead to fighting and violence. I believe that students are v=better off just leaving their phones at home and texting and/or calling their ""bff's"" after school.

Inconclusive, I believe that phoebes should not be allowed at school, therefore, I am asking that you pick Policy 2. the reason I believe that phones shouldn't be allowed in school is because: kids don't always follow the rules, phones are a big distraction, and last phones can link to violence.

I don't think cell phones should be allowed at school at any time. The reason i think this is because; it would be unfair to others, some people would take advantage of it, you should be studying or finishing work during your free time, having phones out at school could cause many problems, people would use phones to cheat on test or class work, and grades would start slipping in with many people because their phones would distract them from doing their work.

Some ways it would be unfair to others is; those who don't have a phone wouldn't have the same advantages as others, while others are at free time or lunch the people in class wont get to have their phones, and those that don't have free time won't get to use their phones.

Also, some kids would always have their phones with them and they would be texting instead of paying attention to the lessons. By doing that they wouldn't learn a thing. Therefore they are taking advantage of he privilege given to them.

Free hour or free time should be used to study or make up on late or unfinished assignments. Free periods or free time is given to you for certain reasons, it is school time still, and you should use that time for school work not for social time.

Having cell phones period causes problems imagine what it could do at school. Rumors and gossip will be spread around way more and a lot faster then without phones. Cyber bullying and fights will happen more. Phones may possibly be stolen or lost and that would not be good.

Some people who aren't in class and have access to their phones might help someone cheat on a test or just the class work they have, and in that case grades from many people would slip because they aren't actually learning. Without students actually learning the school might start to look bad.

I hope you agree with all or some of these conditions. I honestly believe cell phones and schools were not meant to be together.

I believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school but can only use them at lunch and passing period. I believe this because if students are allowed to use their phones, they will appreciate school more and want to be here more and if they use them in class they will be confiscated.

One reason I think students should be able to use their phones is if they need to contact a parent/guardian, they can be able to communicate with them or need to get information from another student, they can have access to them

One example of what you should do to confiscate it would be to take it and a parent/guardian must pick up the phone. If caught twice will be kept till the end of the year. I the student is a caught the next year with their phone, it will be taken and given to them after graduation. Another example would be to take the phone each day they are caught with it and have them send a letter to the principal, their parents, and their teachers.

I believe that through this much information that you would consider letting students bring their phone on campus and let them use it during passing period and lunch.

I think you should let students bring cell phones to school as long as they don't use them during class time. If you let students bring there phones to school we will all be very happy. We promise not to use them during class .We will only use them for emergencies or for calling home for our lunch. Letting us bring our phones in school will also stop kids from bringing them in and using them and getting in trouble .

I know your probably getting tired of having to give people detentions . Trust me were tired of getting them. I know you care just as much about our education as we do .So let us bring our cell phones too school and quit suspending us for something as stupid as that. We think your the best principal this school has ever had. Please don't ruin that by outlawing cell phones.

Me i personally don't care but the student's i begging you too let us use our cell phones. We promise not to record fights or any thing like that .All we want is too be able too have our cell phones and use them. We wont use them during class. If a student gets caught using them in class you can stop letting us bring them to school.

So now you know why we want our cell phones. read this and think about it. Are cell phones really that big of a deal . All we do is text our friends . sometimes we use them for calling for lunch. So come on just think long and hard about this letter.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I understand your dilemma regarding a new cell phone policy. However, I do not think that it is ever a good time to use cell phones in school. Not even during lunchtime or free periods. The following reasons may help you when making your final decision.

First of all cell phones are unnecessary in school. Who would the kids be calling? All of their friends should be in school! School should be a place for learning, and texting and calling friends doesn't need to be happening. They have all the time they want after school, they don't need to be in contact with friends 24/7. If a student needs to call their parent for some reason they should be permitted to use the phone in the office.

I believe that cell phones during school will also lead to cheating. Most phones now have internet on them, and it is very easy to look up information on them. Say a student has a big history test after lunch and they can't remember the year the Alamo was fought. It would take thirty seconds for them to look up the answer on their phone. This would be unfair to students who have been working and studying hard.

Even though the first policy is still making students turn off phones during class, it probably won't happen. If a student has their phone on during lunch their not going to want to turn it off for class. It's already on so they might as well keep it on. This would also encourage cheating. Kids could text a friend and ask for the answers to questions, and the teacher may never know.

The bottom line is that cell phones are just completely unnecessary in school. Students in middle school and high school don't need to be texting and calling friends during school time. With all the things phones can do nowadays, cheating will be extremely easy for kids who are unsure of answers. And also, most students will not feel the need to turn off their cells phones for class, because they will just get to turn them on again in an hour.

Sincerely,

Why should we be allowed to have cell phones at school? Well the first reason is football players, baseball players, cheerleader, and other after school activates have to have them for when practice is over, but i agree that we should just use them at lunch or when we have free time. We should just leave them in our back packs till after school when we need them. some people use them in class I'm not saying i don't use it in class i text all the time, But that's the teachers fault they should be up at the chalkboard teaching. Instead they sit around texting there wife's and husbands. but i think they should be two teachers in class ,one in the back ,and one up at the board. So the one in the back can look up and down the rows. But if you keep letting the teacher text in class then u should just forget about the MCT cause we never talk about school work we just sit in class like dummy's . but if u let us students bring cell phones and let us text during our free time and lunch then maybe students would get tired of texting and start doing the work. The only reason we do it cause it is illegal",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

Student's love their cell phones, I know this from experience. Being a student myself, I can safely tell you that the students will not be happy at all if you ban cell phones from your school completely. They will almost always have them anyway, and find ways to call or text each other during class. These and other reasons lead me to believe that you should choose Policy 1.

I can easily understand your leaning toward Policy 2, because you are a principal, but I still think Policy 1 is best. Although cell phones can be very annoying to teachers and fellow students, they are very helpful also. They allow students to communicate with each other if there is a problem or a change in schedule. For example: the basketball team is having a team meeting at lunch and there is one player who doesn't know. No one can find him anywhere, so just text him! It's a quick and efficient way to update him or her on the lunchtime happenings.

Also, cell phones can be critical to a students safety. Maybe after school a student who cant drive cannot find his or her ride home. Or, some students are bullying him to the extreme, where he might get hurt. A cell phone could be very handy in either of those scenarios. He could call him ride home and find out where it is, or he could call 911 if the upperclassmen were hurting him badly.

You know how teenage students are, they don't want to follow the rules. This leads me to believe that even if you try to ban students from bringing cell phones to school, they will almost find ways to secretly text during class or in the hallways. Hiding them in backpacks, texting in the bathroom, and putting them in sweatshirt pockets are all ways that they could get around the policy.

If you think about it, it might just be a waste of time and energy trying to enforce such an extreme policy if students are not going to obey it anyway. But if you choose Policy 1, and have a little talk with the students telling them that they can still text their friends, but just between classes and during breaks, I think they will understand. I know I would. Of course i would punish them if they did text during class, but not in the hallways or at lunch. It's not extremely binding, but somewhat limiting, which is O.K. I mean, we're with all our friends anyway!

I think your idea of allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phone are turned off during class time, might be the best or possible policy because i don't think that its fare to not allow phones in school at all. I know that were' re in school and we are there to learn, but shouldn't we be able to have some kind of reward for doing school. sometimes there are student that doesn't do any work and just sit at text all day, but what about the others. I would say that if you do happened to see ANY student texting in class or on their phone period then you would probably have to take it. I also think that it's bad enough we have to wear uniforms, now we cant have phone either. If the principle did decide to not let phones into schools at all, then i really wouldn't understand why because i know that us students are tired of hearing the same thing over and over again about cell phones killing or taking over our brain sells. I think the best way for the principle to pick which policy would be to let the students vote on it and if policy one gets picked then the principle would just have to do something about the students that are using their phones in school. I can see a lot of students being sneaky and conniving by using their phones in school. So to tell the truth it really doesn't matter to me if the principle picks policy 1 or 2.

I think that students are concentrated in their phone then they on their school work. And it would be there fault when the do bad on a test or even when they loose their phone or get there phone taken.

You would be able to get your mom to bring you something if needed. You would be able to tell your friends something during the break and not have to be right there beside them.

Yes, It would be nice to get to have my phone during my break because I could tell my friends where we are going to get together. It would make school a lot easier to communicate with others in the school. We would be able to text or call or classmates and friends to find out where they are at instead of running around the school looking for them. It wouldn't take as long to find everyone to get together to work on your homework or study together. Everyone would be able to find each other ,and get together to have more study time.

You would be able to let your parents know that you are going to stay after school for something. You could get your parents to bring you something to the school. You would be able to get in touch with them while you are at school instead of waiting till you get home that afternoon. Then they would know ahead of time what you will be doing after school. It would just make everyone's lives easier to know hat is going on at school.

You will have time to talk with friends and classmates and work together to get some home work done while you are on a break. I know you are thinking that it will become a problem when you start trying the new rule with everyone's phones going of during class ,but just take there phones from them for a couple days and they will remember next time. If that doesn't work then tell them to tell there friends to help them remember to turn the sound off before there class starts.

I believe that the first policy would be the best choice. Policy One states that students are allowed to use their phones during lunch and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class. This policy would be the correct choice for you to make. Children mainly use phones in class because they want to feel like they have freedom. This policy would be the best choice due to a couple of reasons in specific. Kids want to have freedom, communicate, and make sure an emergency doesn't occur.

Kids at school want to have freedom. They want to feel like they aren't overly burdened and under super strict government. Just like the original founders of our constitution, most want to be free and have privacy and other benefits while still learning at school. With the use of phones in free time, they will be able to accomplish freedom. They can text or call or go on the internet during their spare time. This is a huge reason to chose policy number one.

Students want to be able to communicate. Some kids aren't able to see all of their friends to due to conflicting schedules and areas. A kid may be on the other side of the school as another, but cell phones, they can still communicate to each other. Communicating can help students a lot by preparing them. Kids can tell each other what they will do in a class and/or what their homework is. With the use of technology, kids can basically talk to their entire school with the touch of a button.

The most important reason to use cell phones during school is to prevent emergency. Kids have homes and property that belong to their family. With the use of a cell phone, kids can get messages from a parent telling them if they are needed for help or anything. An emergency may also be avoided at the school. If a child sees a fire but is unable to get to a fire alarm, he/she may call the local fire department. This could possibly save the school.

Cell phones would play a big role in kids lives. With the help of a cell phone, kids have instant access to anything the need. As long as they aren't being used during class, Policy One is the correct choice. I really hope you consider and accept my proposal and chose policy number on.

I think that we should be able to have our cell phones at school and be able to have them on during lunch and other free times and off during classes. It's a better idea because if we couldn't bring them to school at all it might not turn out so well.

If we couldn't bring our cell phones to school, we wouldn't be able to call our parents if a sports practice is done or cancelled from bad weather, or you missed the bus, or you had to stay after for a test or gym make-ups. I know what your thinking we could just use the school phones, but it takes so long to do that, it's so much easier to text or call someone to pick you up, because you have their number in your phone if you don't know it and instead have to spend a couple minutes trying to find their number.

I think we should have them because you could communicate with friends at lunch or other free times, instead of asking if you could go look for them if you had to ask them something. Honestly, if our school did have the rule that we could have our cell phones out at lunch or free times and not in classes, everyone I know would want that, but so many kids would be texting during class and not paying attention. Even if you had the rule that we couldn't even bring them to school, how many people do you think would listen? I would probably bring mine out of habit, for if I have practices or if I stayed after school, but I never text or have my phone in class or even on for that matter. But people would text even more and have their cell phones out way more if we had that rule at school. It would be chaos, kids getting in trouble day after day because of their cell phones.

Either way kids are probably going to still have their phones out and using them. But, I bet if you surveyed the entire school, pretty much everyone would say they wanted to be able to have their phones out, instead of hiding them like they usually do during class. And who knows, the kids at our school might even listen if we were able to have our phones, because they think it's pointless to go against the rules, when they could just wait until after class, during passing time to use them, it could happen........ just not a very high chance of it happening. So, all in all, I think we should be able to have our phones out when we don't have classes, because kids are going to have them out either way, and it would be the easier choice, on everyone, to make, and kids wouldn't get into trouble on a daily basis. And policy one would just be the better decision.

The cell phone use policy's have come to my attention.

Your students use their phones almost every period.

Your cell phone rule in place right now is not working. The kids get away with texting in class and it is distracting to their work which lowers their grades.

The policy in place right now is that your students can bring their phone to school, but they have to have it turned off.

The kids use their phones anyway.

When you tell them not to use their phones, they are going to use them anyway.

If you tell them they could use their phones at lunch and during their free time they will not use them as much, during class.

Your students grades are dropping and it is because of the cell phone use during class.

Policy number two will be the best policy for your students.

It show them you trust them a lot more and if they need to call their parents that is the time to do it instead of going to the bathroom to call them.

I think that you should enforce policy #1.

You should do this because cell phones at lunch and other free periods aren't really bad at all as long as their used appropriately.

I think you should have a list of rules implying the use of cell phones in school. The penalty for cell phone use in class should be an automatic 3 days of detention and banning the individual of using his phone for a month at school period. After applying the rules to students you should try to convince them of positive ways to use their cell phones at lunch and other free periods.

For example you could persuade them to use the schools wifi and free internet to get work done involving research and use of internet.

You should experiment with the idea for maybe 3 months and determine rather or not you like the outcome of the project.

Many students will love you a lot more if you would just consider policy #1 as a thought.

659143BDC3B2,"I think that the first policy is the best, because it doesn't do any harm to allow students to have their phones during free time or lunch since there are no classes going on at the time. Really there are only two main problems with having cell phones during classes; texting the answers on a test or quiz to a friend, and distracting and disrupting the other students and teachers. Many kids in the middle schools have phones now and they will try to bring them into classes, and carry them around at lunch. Many other schools allow phones during lunch breaks, so I am told by kids from other schools. If a student has his/her phone in their pocket during a class but it is either off, on silent mode, or on airplane mode(phone is unable to text or call or use any sort of feature that requires a signal) it won't disrupt the other class mates. However, it still may be a distraction during class, so then they should remain either off, or not in their pocket, but in their locker. I see teachers using their cell phones in classes all the time, so why shouldn't we be aloud to use ours at lunch or free time?

If a student has a phone and they either have free time or it is lunch period, they should be able to have their phones out and be able to call or text. Some students forget things that they needed for the day and they call or text their parents to bring them to school for them; books, P.E. clothes, lunches, flash drives, assignments, and other things that you may need for a class. And at lunch breaks teachers are usually in the teacher's lounge eating lunch so we are unable to use their classroom phones to call our parents if we are in need of something or aren't feeling good.

I think that phones should be aloud in schools during lunch breaks and free time because even if they are not aloud, kids will still use them and just hide them from teachers which isn't good. If they are just aloud during free time and lunch, kids will have a set time to be able to use their phones and they won't be breaking any rules, or distracting or disrupting others. There is no harm done to allow the use of cell phones during lunch or free time, so why not let the students be able to use them if they have them?",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I believe that policy one is the best policy.

With this students would not sneak there phones around and they would probably pay more attention during class time.

This policy does not have a bad effect to it as far as my knowledge goes.

It would make students happier and make sure that people are paying full attention during all class periods.

I feel that teachers would like this policy also because then students wouldn't say anything if they were to use their phones during class time. This creates an equal opportunity for students and teachers as far as cell phone use goes.

A vote should go on in the school to see how the students and faculty feel about this.

My thoughts are that most of them will choose policy one.

Just making sure that phones are set to vibrate or silent would be best for this policy.

It will make sure that there are no inappropriate ring tones being played during the free times when cell phones are allowed.

My personal opinion is that most schools should consider this policy because it is in the best interest of their students.

It is a great way to better connect with the students.

This also gives them more freedom in school.

I think it will greatly affect the attitude that students have during the day.

This is because they will be able to contact there friends during all hours of the day instead of being cut off from connection from 8 to almost 2:30.

We should allow cell phones in our school. School would be more fun if we were allowed to use our cell phones during our free time or lunch period. Then, turn them off when we get in class. So our teachers won't think we are cheating or being rude to our classmates or teacher. I think kids would stay out of trouble more because students will know the rule is to use the phone during your lunch period or during your free time. Also with these new phones we can get better study time, using the internet. Instead of making the library so busy. A phone can be a good and bad source, but we can think of the positive the phone can bring to our students. Not everyone would have to use this policy, maybe only the students that do not get in trouble as much as the rest of us. When its class time maybe our teachers can check if our phones are off or take them away during class. We can earn our stripes, instead of just receiving the stripes.

I believe you should go with Policy 2. When students bring cell phones to school they use them during down time in class. They text while teachers are talking. This can disturb the learning environment. Students will be distracted by texts they get and will want to respond. They can also pretend to be doing work and be on their phones. There is no way to enforce the rule of having cell phones to school.

Also, with cell phones in school; rumors spread around faster. This can harm a student's reputation. Cyber bullying can also take place. If the students have the resources around them to do it, they will.

Lastly, i believe no cell phones should be in school because it makes teachers jobs harder. They have to teach and watch for phones. It also makes learning harder for students. They become distracted from learning. It can lower test grades; which can make school funding go down.

Students being distracted, teachers on the lookout, and possibly lower test grades is why no cell phones should be allowed in school.

I believe that students should be able to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free periods, as long as they are turned off during class. Students prize their phones and feel insecure without them; therefore, it might be better if they are allowed to keep them in their backpacks.

Phones are a problem; they are a distraction in the classroom and in the halls, even if we are not allowed to use them. Some students pay more attention to their phones then the teacher or other people around them. During class students are looking down and texting their friends instead of paying attention to what they are supposed to be learning. In the hallways students are looking at their phones instead of watching where they are going. Not only are they bumping into others but they are also late to class. It is dangerous in the hallways and is causing grades to suffer. But I do not believe that banning them from the school is the best way to solve this issue.

Many times, students are giving phones by their parents for safety reasons and if they are not allowed to bring them to school the parents might get upset. Right now students are allowed to bring phones to school as long as they are turned off and inside our backpacks until school is over. If students aren't allowed to bring their phones at all they might rebel and bring them anyway by sneaking them in their pockets and backpacks. Phones, and other electronics, are a big part of today's society and students are proud to be a part of it. If they are denied to be able to part of that society, even if it is only during school hours, it will anger them. But students would be more willing to cooperate if there was a compromise, such as being able to use their phones during certain times of the day. I believe this is the most reasonable solution. Instead of having students try to smuggle their phones into school and sneakily text during class periods they would be willing to wait till lunch and other free periods.

So I believe that students should be able to use their phones during lunch period and other free periods. It will solve the issue of grades suffering and will also please the students.

And if you let kids use their phones during lunch and free time they will be less tempted to text in class because they are already done. Kids also will get higher grades if they pay attention in class when they already got their texting out. I can see how you feel about cell phones and you probably don't really want kids to use them at all, but it is probably better for all of the students if they use there phones when they know they 're allowed then when they are scared and stressing that they might get caught.

I believe that policy #1 is the better choice for our school. I think that allowing students to actually use their phones during lunch or their free time would actually prevent many cases of students' phones to be taken up and interrupting class.

It would be more wise if we were allowed to have phones in school. For instance, if there is an emergency or any scheduling problems of some sort at school, then obviously the students would have to call their parents or friends to resolve any of those conflicts. Let's face it, if the students in our school weren't allowed to bring their phones, they would probably still bring them anyway. What if one of your students forgot a permission slip or homework that they really needed to bring to their next class, but had no way to contact or call their parents to bring it to school for them? What if they forgot their lunch money at home and had no way to eat? I think that allowing students to use their phones during different times of the school day is the right choice. Everyday, teachers take up at least a few phones during important class time that needs to be used teaching the class and not having to write out office referrals, using up the class time. I do agree with the second part of the policy that says that phones should be turned of during class. I am not one of those students who have the constant need to always run their thumbs texting and socializing in class. That's what we're in school for-- to learn, not to socialize with friends during class.

In my opinion you should use cell phone policy two. If you use policy one, children might be tempted to use their phones in class even though it says that they need to be turned off. Children today know how to find ways on how to use their phone in class. Teachers will probably not notice children using their phone in class because their back is usually turned to the class in order to write on the chalkboard/white board. For example, some children will try to look as if they were looking for something in their backpack when really they are texting. With policy two children wouldn't even have their phones in class which would take the temptations of using their phone in class away. To help enforce policy two you should get the parents involved. You should have all parents check their child for their phones, because knowing most children the WILL try to sneak their phone to school. Another option would be to turn in their phones in the morning and then picking them up right as school ends before they leave. Also, without their phones, children will pay more attention in class instead of trying to text and they will get better grades. All in all I think that Policy two would be the better choice. I hope that this letter will aid you in deciding in a cell phone policy.

I believe that choice number one would be the best decision because students would bring there phones any way despite the rules.

If you allow students to use there phones during lunch and other free times that would decrease there need to text during classes. Also students would not have to try to hide the phones during there free times. I personally agree with this option because how I see it is if you are not doing anything in class and the teachers allow you to have free time i don't understand why you couldn't its just like talking accept that it is texting and your on a phone, also in decreases the noise level since they would be texting. Also i think it is a good idea to let students have their cell phones because of after school activities, they don't always end on time and instead of using the schools energy they would be using their own.

I do believe that letting students have their cell phones would be a good thing for the school and the students. So with this I hope you consider option number one for the schools phone dilemma.

Cell phones have been a great hassle in schools seeing as kids use them to send messages to each other or call each other. But cell phones can also be an important thing to carry around. I am writing this letter to you to help you on a decision on the schools cell phone policy. With the two possible choices there are i like policy 1 the best.

Policy number one states that students are allowed to bring there phones to school and use them freely. To me this seems like a not thought out plan because the student are already with there friends so why would they need to use them at school. The only time cell phones would be necessary at school would be during an emergency. But this is also helpful incase a student forgets something at home or has an accident they can call there parents or who ever to come and help them.

Policy 2 states that students aren't allowed to have phones at school at all. Honestly that doesn't sound like a good idea because of the reason that there going to use it anyway. Most students will use there phones in school anyway wet her or not you say they cant. If this policy is chosen there would be a lot more problems at school. More students will get caught with there cell phones out and get in trouble.

Policy 1 is the better choice in this dispute between policy's because there would be less students in trouble. Policy 2 would only bring more trouble to schools and more work for principles or counsellors. Policy 1 is the more fare and equal one and well its a lot of fun to use your phone. So go with policy 1 it will save you time and a lot of disputes between parents and students.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I think that students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class. Most students already do this so it should just be allowed at these certain times. Students would most likely like to have this time on their phones.

If you gave students this time on their phones then the students wouldn't use them in class or hide the fact they are using them during their free time without teachers being around them. Just think about how many students do this and would like to have time instead of not paying attention in class or hiding that they are using their phones. It is only lunch and free time, which there is no class time going on. If the thing to worry about is the ringers and sound, the phones should be put on vibrate or silent during these times. I think that students can follow this rule.

Teachers at the school probably also use their phones during class and in their free time. If the teachers are using their phones during class then students should at least be able to use their phones during lunch and free time. This is not as bad as most teachers using them at school, during classes. If the students don't follow the rules with the ringers or they get caught having their phone out during class then it can just get taken for that day.

You can make rules with them like I said before, the ringers shouldn't be on, no music can be played, and don't use them during class time only in free time. those are good rules and easy to follow, but there can be consequences if you don't follow these rules. Some consequences can be phone taken away if you hear the ringer, detention if used during class time instead of the time you were allowed and there can be many other possibilities for consequences.

I really hope that you consider the idea of letting students use there phones during free time and lunch periods. The students would love this idea and the rules are easy to follow and everyone would follow them just because you gave them time to use phones. If not they will know what the consequences are, it's that simple. Thank you for having the time to read my opinion on phone use during school.

Thank You,

Students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, to be used during lunch periods and or free time. Cell phone usage has increased in the last five to ten years and is an important gadget for everyday life. People have social lives in school and cell phones are a very important way to communicate socially as well as in emergencies. Cell phones may be a distraction and can disrupt the learning environment of the class that is why it should be used during lunch hours. you may agree or disagree with my view on usage of cell phones in school , but most of the students at school agree with me. Also cell phone usage is not harmful towards the education of a student if used during parts of school time where no one is teaching.

Many people including you may think that there are so many negative point in cell phone usage during lunch but actually it really is not. If you think about it lunch is used to socialize and so is free time. So during the period of lunch, kids who are sick or on vacation can communicate with friends at school at that time, also if you are planning to go somewhere and you want tell your family beforehand you can give them a call or send a text, or if you just want to talk to someone in a different school you can if cell phone usage is allowed. there might be negatives to, but that can be easily turned positive.

Cell phones also can be disruptive during class, and we all know that if cell phones are allowed to be used there must be some rules and regulations and I have come up with some. First cell phones should not be used during class time. All phones should be placed on silent and any cell phone should not interfere with the learning environment during any class. If any of these rules are violated you may come up with your own consequences and enforce them. So please take this letter into consideration and hopefully you will listen to the voice of many kids and allow cell phone usage during lunch hours or free time.

Many teen students have been using cell phones during school. It is against school policy to do this and many teachers do not take much action in stopping this. But I believe that reconsidering this to allow students to use cell phones during free time and lunch is not a good idea. This is not a good idea because most cellular devices come with the use of internet and this can be abused by most teenage students.

If you consider policy number 1, then I believe students at lunch will use the internet on there phone to look up any answers to at test or any other forms of classroom work. Student could just skip a problem on a test and wait until lunch to look it up which defeats the purpose of studying and learning. Also cell phones could be abused the same way in other free times using text messaging. During free times a student could use text messaging to stay in touch with a friend who has already taken the test or work and cheat.

Also student could also use the internet by looking at graphic pictures or videos. During free times teachers do not know what the student could be doing on his or her cell phones. This could be a big problem to schools and teachers who allow the use of cell phones in class. Blocking these sites on school computers does not effect the same sites on a cell phone. So even though blocking the sites, this will not block the same sites visited on a cellular device by a student.

Students all over the country are abusing the use of cell phones in class. They use them to cheat during test and exams or use them to look up unapproved websites. And allowing them to have them out means less security on what they might be doing on them. So I do not agree on letting students use cell phones, and that there should be a higher security on the use of these devices because modern day cell phones are pretty much like hand held computers and you never know what a student could be using it for.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Also parents would not have to come to school to just pick up our cell phones. Now days kids are getting in trouble mainly because of their cell phone going off during class or it falls out of their pocket. But why are we not aloud to have cell phones? Another good reason for letting use our cell phones is because some students have extra ciricail activities after school and what if the child needs to remind there parents to pick them up after school. What if a student forgets their homework at home and the school want let them call their parents so they can bring the homework to the child so he/she don't get a bad grade for their homework assignment.

I have heard of the two possible policies involving the usage of cellular devices, our cell phones, and I would like to say that you should consider policy one. Policy one, allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as the phone are turned off during class, is a better policy as many teens love using the cellular devices to stay in contact with friends and classmates. I for one love talking to my peers using my cell phone , and its pretty boring to not be able to do such things as texting and during out lunch periods and other free time that we have and the opportunities during those times is very tempting for some teens. I know if policy one were put into place I would be very happy as well would other students as it most teens love freedom and providing this freedom will bring some sort of satisfaction to them. Policy two, do not allow students to have phones at school at all, is a very bad idea as teens are very rebellious and would cause them to use there cell phones even more as an act of rebellion towards the leader. If a compromise is reached which I say is policy one then the rebellious acts of the teenagers will simmer down and cause less rules involving our cellular devices to be broken. Thought this will not stop all students from still using there cellular devices during class so i suggest that if a student is found using there cell phone during class that this privilege is taken away and will be returned once the teacher thinks the student is trustworthy. So please as a proud student of our school put policy one into place and we promise you will be very pleased with the results.

B60F7934AD0D,"""Ahhhh!"" RELATIVE_NAME had a sudden fall on the recess cement. First you heard a crack, and the a boom! It was like a bomb has just exploded it was very unexpected. In about a second RELATIVE_NAME flung up and ran away. Everybody suddenly simply stared startled at her fall. Now imagine students had their phone during that little action. You would hear snapshots all over the place, feeling like you were on the red carpet. Phones must be banned during all times of the school day, even recess and lunch. How unlucky would it be for poor RELATIVE_NAME if pictures of her got around? My principal should not allow phones at all, it can lead to violence, bullying, and distraction.

How would you feel if you were being the number one thing being talked about through an electronic device? It is difficult enough in the evening where a lot of fighting starts through phones, but during school is a big mistake. First you hear a punch and then a scream. ""Oww!"" STUDENT_NAME screamed when STUDENT_NAME punched him as if he was a pillow, went right through him. the cause of this fight was over text when student's rumored STUDENT_NAME wanted to fight which set STUDENT_NAME on the loose. Calling and texting during lunch, recess, and free times will be a big regret for the principal. Students can use their phones to cause fist fights, and harming themselves. It puts a lot of students in danger and risk.

When was the last time you heard the word bully? Advisory class, the police department, language arts class, the news, everywhere that word is being talked about and used. Well with cell phones during school this word will become a large increase. Being in use and talked about. It is a proven fact that every hour of the day a kid commits a suicide because of stuggles at school. Who would want to bring this risk to a higher level? You never know how much can spread and happen to anyone in such a short period of time at school.

The last component on which bringing cell phones into school time is such a bad idea is distraction. Normally during the day many student's now study for their afternoon science, math, french, etc. class test during recess, lunch, and free time. The usage of this electronic device will bring down grades and bring up less focus. During class even without their cellphones dream about having the device in their hands. It has become an addiction and when using it at school teachers and parents will not be happy with the results.

Bringing cellphones in school time will do nothing good besides cause even more violence, cruel bullying, and a lot of distractions. Student's will get involved with low recommended activities which will not improve student's behavior and grades. Our principal will soon see more kid's in his office and everybody's head buried into their devices not books. It is required for student's to have a good behavior and high grades in order to be involved with a lot of activities.

I think that we should be able to have our phones in school during lunch and free periods. The reason is what if you had a medical emergency? and didn't have the phone number of that parent?. The policy's you made were very good and if we were aloud to have our phones in school it would make everyone a lot more happy. The only bad thing to this is that everyone knows that the students keep there phones on and the interruption to the class would be aggravating. I'm not saying that having phones during free periods and lunch is a bad thing but it may be in some situations. To be specific they might text during a test or maybe in the middle of class and its embarrassing not only to them but the teacher. The class may think its funny but some people just find it aggravating if this does happen i think that the students phone should be taken away.

If you do accept this policy i think that you should do some sort of phone check just make five or ten minutes for them to check the phones, or even take the phones from the students and then give them back to them before lunch and during the free periods. The reason i like this policy is because we are teenagers and for some people there phone is there lifeline. But for others they have a phone for ""Emergency's""

Policy 1 is a great idea cause students would be able response to there messages during lunch time and will also be able to use it when they have free time in class. As long as we get to use them when we have free it would be ok for them cause every student usually there cell phone when they are finished with there work or are just very bored.

Lunch time is also a great time for students 2 use there cell phones cause they aren't doing any work just relaxing with friends and eat talking also catching up with old friends so at that time they can also use there cell phones.

Students now a days think its cool to be carrying a cell phone so of course they're gonna be showing it to there friends or giving each other numbers. Usually they be showing and using them in class when teachers are giving directions and cause of the rules it sometimes gets more tempted to use your self phone.

I no a lot of kids that use there phones during class, and i think that if you use this policy the kids would loosen up more and stop using the phone is class, for the simple reason that they will get to use there phone during lunch and free time. the reason that kids use there phones in class is because they need to talk to a parent or gardenias about something. let them no that if they are using it in class o As long as the phone stays turned off at all times, if you are colt with the cell phone you get it taken away and you have big consequences.

policy number one is the best way to go, i think because it gives the students more freedom and i think that is what most kids need these days, not under lock down ALL the time. Kids like to know that they can be trusted, and giving them the freedom to use there phones during school hours is a great why to show that. I understand why they had the rule off not being able to use the phone during class, but at lunch and on there own time i don't see why not. If the students free time is supposed to be studying and he uses his phone, don't make a big deal about it because that is his grade not yours.

when the students has no tine to use his or her cell phone during school they feel the need to use it during class. When the student uses the cell phone during class it takes away from the learning, you may think that is just like the free time, he should be studying but he is texting, it is different because that is his free time, this is in class. giving the student time to use his or her phone, to make phone calls, text a friend, or just have fun and take pictures may help out the ""texting in class"" problem.

You also should have the freedom to use cell phones in your free time, because it is your free time, you can do anything you want with the time you have.

Phones should be turned off in class, and if you are caught with one, you should be punished by taking the phones away until the end of the day. Kids should know that there should not be any phones in class. If you are a small child and you have recess, you have the freedom to use that as a time to socialize and get phone numbers or play games on the phone. It's your time and you should use it any way you want to use it. Free time is a time to relax and get away from all the hard work put into school work. If you like to have fun with your phone, you are allowed to have fun, everybody wants to have fun. But kids and even adults need to know when it is time to be serious and be focused.

You should be able to use it during lunch, free time or getting ready for sports. you shouldn't be able to use it in study hall time, class time, or playing sports.

There should be some rules against using cell phones. You should ban cell phones if a student uses it too much at a bad time, like in class. If you are addicted to playing a game, and you play in class, out of class and on buses. The student should not be allowed to bring it to school, because the student could be using it at any time.

It has come to the student bodies' attention that you are reconsidering the cell phone policy.

I think that you should completely ban all cell phones from school forever.

If you think about it more bad things would come from being allowed to use our phones during school than good things.

If we are not allowed to bring our phones to school there will not be as many people that cheat on their school work.

Some people will ask each other what the answer to a question is via text message.

Another reason is that if we are allowed to have phones some people will go into the bathroom and use them for unethical purposes.

The first reason we should not be allowed to have phones is that people cheat.

Some of my best friends have sent me a text message in the middle of a test asking the answer to a question.

If we make our cell phone policies more strict we will not have to worry about that as much.

If we allow cell phones in school, even if we can just use them in free periods, people will still try to cheat in the middle of class because having the freedom to use your phone part of the time makes teenagers think that you use them all of the time.

The next reason that we should not be allowed to have cell phones during school is that people will take their phones and use them for bad things.

They will take dirty pictures and send them to each other, this is what they call ""sexting.""

I believe it is a horrible disgrace to any one who would ever do something like that, and I know you do not want that type of stuff going on in your school.

I think that students should be allowed to have cell phones during free periods and lunch times. I think this because students use cell phones during those times anyway. Students can use cell phones during school without getting caught during school and don't really care if they get caught. Allowing cell phones during free time can let them check things like e-mail or facebook and let them talk to there friends.

Anther reason to allow cell phones in school is that they can lead to better grades. This is because if students can use them during free time they won't have to use them during class witch can cause them to pay more attention to the subject. If students pay more attention during class it can lead to better grades.

Cell phones have always been a problem at schools , even when they first came out. Policy 1 sounds like a particularly good idea because , one , students sometimes text during classes and school because they know they're not supposed to and doing so makes them feel like a rebel and like they have power. On the other hand , policy 2 would just eliminate the problem straight forward. making texting during a class impossible. Another thought , going back to policy 1 , is that if students could text during passing periods and lunch periods they may not have the need to want to text during class because they are being able to text during the school day.

Policy 1 has some good strong points , having students be able to text during free times of the day , but at the same time , what if they're texting someone to come and pick them up from school when really they just don't want to be there? Or they use it to get in contact with a friend to tell them that they're going to skip a class? And lastly what if there is a lockdown during the school day and the student's parents kept trying to call the student and their phone goes off when the terrorist is passing by the class?

Policy 2 has a lot of good strong points , students wouldn't be texting in classes , and could focus in class and learn , they wouldn't be able to call someone to pick them up when they're perfectly fine , and phone theft or loss wouldn't be a problem at all. But there are some weak points to this policy also. Students who walk home wouldn't be able to get in contact with a parent if something happens to them after school , or what if something happens to a parent after school ,they wouldn't be able to get in contact with the student.

Both of these policies are very good policies , but I'd have to go with policy 2 , because it just makes more since and eliminates more problems that would affect the student's ability to learn.

We believe we should be-able to use our cell phones during our lunch period and other free times. All of us agree because there is no point in having our cell phones off all day. This is because maybe our parents sent us a text saying not to take the bus home because they're going to come and pick us up or , that we have to ride with someone else after school because they have to work late.

But if we don't get that text we end up going on the wrong bus or we miss our only open doctor's appointment we can get in two months because it is the time of year where everyone is getting sick. What do we if we end up getting home but we didn't get that text then we're stuck there and it's winter and we forgot our house-key because our parent's were supposed to be home, not picking us up from school.

But, if we do have our phones during a free passing zone or at lunch-time then we can get that text message saying to not ride the bus home and/or to ride home with this person because our parents have to work late. If we don't get that call or text and we go to the bus and just then get the text to go with that other person, then you have to run back out to the circle drive and you were too late getting there because your ride already left and you live clear in the country , how are we going to get home? The only thing we can do is to wait for our parents to get off work (really late) at the school , who's doors closes at 4:45 P.M anyway. Then we have to wait in the cold for another three to four hours for our parent(s) to get there.

Then because of waiting in the cold all that time the next morning you realize you are sick and you can't go to school. But, that day you have three tests, and many quizzes what do you do then, go to school with a fever and not feeling well to get all your tests done, or stay home and then miss all the new studies started after the tests in each class?

Would you like to be in that position, Sir? Because we know we wouldn't. So we believe we should be able to have cell phone use during our lunch periods and during our other free time. We should not be in the spot where all because we didn't get a text message we went the wrong way.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I believe policy 2 is the best way to go because not every student breaks the rules and texts during class and it just would not be fair to them if they cannot bring their phones period. If you go with policy 2 you can just look over your class every so often to make sure no one has their cell phone out. You could also let the class know that they can check their phones during lunch and free time so there is no need to be checking them during class. You should be able to trust them to follow those rules because they know and should be grateful that they can check them during free times.

Another reason why i think policy 2 is the best idea is because students need the cell phones that their parents provide them with to communicate with them throughout the day. They may also need it after school to call their parents to see how they are getting home, and if they don't have their cell phones there is no way they will know what to do or where to go after school.

plus, they would need to call their parents if anything dangerous was going on at the school and it went on lockdown. Parents would be devastated if something bad happened to their child during a time like that and they didn't know because no one had a cell phone to call them. This is what i believe so i hope this letter has helped you and you can take it into consideration.

I think you should allow kids to bring there cell phones to school. Because if they need something they can just call up there mom/dad, and have them bring it to them during lunch. Instead of asking the teacher if he/she can leave the class and go all the way up to the office. And the teacher would probably say yes but he might also be mad because he was about to give a test or something. And I personally think it would be a lot easier to just ask the teacher to use your cell phone and call your mom/dad, to bring you something during your lunch period. It would be allot easier to just do that instead of having to walk all the way to the other side of the school to the office. And the teacher doesn't even no if you are going to the office for all he knows you could just be wandering around the school doing nothing you're suppose to be doing at all. So that's why I think you should allow kids to use cell phones during lunch and passing periods.

Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that kids should be allowed to use cell phones during free time in school.

Cell phones provide a way of communicating with your parents and other people you need to talk to.

If you forgot something or you need something for after school activities, you can just call your parents to bring the things you need to school.

Also if there was a lock-in at school, you can call your parents to inform them that you're okay and everything is fine.

In addition if you want to go to your friend's house and you need your parents to sign a slip to let you go on your friends bus, they can just bring it to school.

When you are not feeling well and you feel the need to go home, you call your parents to let them know you are not feeling that well.

Although you can use the school's phone, it is much easier for kids to just use their phones.

We can still keep the rule of ""green zones"" and ""red zones"" for allowing phone use in the classroom.

If it is a ""green zone"", you are allowed to have your phone on and use it for any purposes, but if it is a ""red zone"", you are supposed to have your phone turned off or on silent in your pocket.

But the teacher of the classroom is in control of the ""zones"".

The teacher may let his/her students use cell phones during study center or for any activity their doing.

You can still keep the consequences of having your cell phone out during class.

First time is giving the phone to your teacher until the end of class, second time is a call to your parents, and third time is a trip to your office with the student's parents.

Cell phones are just a good way of communicating.

I know that you can trust SCHOOL_NAME

students about being responsible and to not take advantage of the cell phones.

Please take the note of consideration of keeping cell phones in SCHOOL_NAME.

My opinion on the cell phone policy is that students should be allowed to have their phones out during lunch or other free periods. This would be a better policy because this way, students may text or call their parents if they need to talk to them about getting a ride home or bringing them lunch to school. No body wants to have to go to the office and wait to use the phone just to call their parents when they have a cell phone in their pocket.

Students use their phones at school anyways so its not like the no cell phone rule really works. Students text during class all the time. A lot of kids just got to the bathroom when they need to call their parents instead of going to the office and waiting. No body really cares about the no cell phone rule, they just text or call anyways.

I think students should be allowed at least to use their phones during lunch or free periods. I can see how it is a distraction during class time but if its recess and you need to text your mom or dad to tell them that you are going home with a friend, or that you don't have basketball practice after school, then I don't see how that is a problem or distraction. If students phones get stolen then that's their fault and their problem, not the schools.

I think you should really consider changing the rule to cell phones are allowed during lunch and other free periods. I don't see how its any problem. Students use their phones anyways but now, they wont have to hide it during lunch and recess. If someone's phone goes off during class, or the teacher catches them texting in class, then the teacher may take it away and I understand that, but at lunch and recess, I don't think the cell phones should be taken away. It is no problem or distraction or disruption for student to use cell phones during recess time. Any time other than that is not acceptable but lunch and recess should be allowed!

Thank you for reading my paper and I hope you consider my opinion!

I believe that you should go with policy one for the new cell phone policy. Students like to have their phones at school. They can easily text their friends during free time and lunch. I would love to have my phone out during free time, to talk to my friends that I can't see until lunch. This policy would make many students happy, and wouldn't try to hide their phones. But if they have their phones out during class, it should be taken away.

Even if we just got to have them out during lunch, that would be great too! Students try to text secretly behind the teacher's backs, but that would change if we were actually allowed to have our phones out during certain times. They would just wait until free time to text people. I do believe that there should still be certain standards, like if you are not using a cell phone properly, it can be taken away. Also if you even see a phone in the classroom, the teacher should be able to take it away and give it back after school is over.

This would also be a good policy because I see teachers text on their cell phones all the time. The rule is supposed to apply to everyone, so why don't teachers get in trouble for it? With this policy, everyone would be allowed the same thing, and would have to wait until some free time. Students get detentions if they are texting during class, but when the teachers text, they don't get in any form of trouble. If you want this school to be a fair community, then you should go with policy one.

If you use policy two, and do not let students have phones at school at all, they will still be trying to text during lunch and free time. It would be better if we were just allowed to have our phones out, instead of having a handful of students in detention for texting. Policy two would also make a lot of students upset because if they would have gotten a chance to be responsible and text only when allowed, they would have taken that opportunity. It would be nice to at least be given a chance to be responsible phone owners.

I hope this letter lets you see how we would handle this situation if you chose policy one. We would appreciate it a lot, and would feel trusted by our principal. Thanks for taking the time to see why we would like to have policy one as our new cell phone policy. We know you are a busy person, and we respect your decision.

Hi I am STUDENT_NAME I agree with the choice that says we should be allowed to have our phones out in class during lunch and during free time. I think This because kids want to have their cell phones out any ways. We also have our cell phones out even if the rule isn't passed. Cell phones basically is what the world revolves around. Everybody and their mamas have a cell phone. This generation is all about technology.

I know that you are probably thinking that we are going to do things that we are not supposed to be doing, but we do it anyways so why not just let us do it in the open. I personally don't see why the rule says that we can't have them out it will benefit us also. I do understand why you wouldn't let us have them out because you think that we are going to have it out during class and stuff. Well why punish us all for what a couple of people who got caught did. Why not just take the privilege away from them and not everybody? This school I know can do it. We have been trustworthy school. Think you should take this letter into consideration and let us use our cell phones during lunch and free time.

I have been hearing that a new cell phone policy is possible. I know that students may abuse the privilege of having phones in school but if they can be off in class or if the teacher can be diligent and notice if a student is texting in class, then i would agree with policy 1.

If students miss the bus or have to stay late, there should be a way for them to make contact with their parents or someone to pick them up. If there is in an accident at a sports practice or event and contact needs to be made, cell phones would be very convenient. Many people would agree but they are usually older teachers who are fed up with technological advances and the ability to do things easier. These are the people that would rather wait a week for a newspaper advertisement than go on the internet and find something in two minutes.

There have been problems with students using cell phones in a way that is not recommended in school and that is not surprising. With every new thing, there comes a problem. That's just life. I don't understand why people cannot except that concept. Most students would agree with the truth that cell phones do more good than harm.

Here is an example. Imagine a student had wrestling practice after school and halfway through practice, he tears a muscle. He needs to be taken to the emergency room immediately or he may be incapacitated for several months. He brought a cell phone to school that day so he called 911 and was picked up. He was bandaged up and was soon wrestling again.

The moral of the story is that cell phones help people in times of need and are simply more convenient. If cell phones were completely removed from schools, there would be many occurrences that could be in need of a cell phone's help, but instead have to deal without them.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school to use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I believe they should do this because if there not doing anything the students using there cell phones isn't going to hurt them. Especially at lunch when there eating or having conversations they should be able to use there phone its not harming themselves or others . Maybe they need to talk to a parent or something serious letting them use there phone would be great just as long as they don't use it in class. They could have family emergency's and everything and them having a phone would be pleasant. Them having it in class is not really bad at all especially when they have teachers watching them a lot im sure they cant call or text anyone while there in the classroom trying to learn.

It is only fare that students should be able to have cell phone at school, then not have any cell phones at school at all. If teachers can have cell phones at school so can the students. I think if a teachers phone goes off in class that the students phone can go off in class because it is only fare, I also believe that if a student needs to be able to talk to their parents during lunch or any free time they should be able to.

My reasons for this are because if there is an emergency they should be able to talk to a parent or call for help even call a friend to help or do something about the situation or problem. Another reason is so the student can be able to hang out or be in touch with other people or let someone now if things are ok. One more reason for this choose is because kids and teens need to have a life and be free and who they want to be.

Another idea is so the student can let a parent or guardian know if they have to stay after school or even let a friend now to met him /her at a certain location after school. I also think that we should have a certain perspective on how the teachers use there phone at school.

I think Policy 1 is better, because then you can bring your brand-new phone you got from a celebration or for a reward. Policy 2 says cell phones are not allowed , then what is the reason to have a phone if your not allowed to have it. Lets say your parent/parents are being held up and can't pick you up from school, so then somebody else has to pick you up or take the bus home. You play for the school's baseball team and a last minute game was scheduled and you have to play today in 30 minutes, but your parent/parents doesn't know so how are going to get a ride home. You have to get your or borrow somebody else phone to call him/her. There is a bomb threat and the terr says if the police comes the school will blow up, so you have to secretly call the police tell them what the person said and the information he/she is giving while the teacher is asking questions. The police finds out who the person is and tracks the call and arrest the terrorist.

There is a fire and somebody was hurt, so you or somebody has to call the 9-1-1 to put the fire and see if the victim was seriously hurt. there was an earthquake and somebody broke their leg and you are trapped with the victim, so you have to call 9-1-1. That is why you should use Policy 1.

I believe you should allow all of the students in our school, to use their cell phones during lunch other free times, during the school schedule. It would be extremely beneficial to us. For example there are many students in the school who break the rules break by using it during class, which distracts them from what the teacher is instructing the class or lecture they are trying to give. At the same time the student is risking the confiscation of their cell phone. If the new rule is implemented, students will put their cell phones away during class, because they will know as soon as the bell rings, they will have enough free time to text their friends or receive important calls. That way during class, the instructor has their full and undivided attention.

As I said early, students may have to receive urgent and important cell phone calls from their parents, regarding transportation issues and family emergencies. For example, if a student's mother is forced to work a double shift at her minimum wage job and needs to contact her son to tell him to ask, one of his class mates to give a ride or take the bus. He will receive the call, because according to school police, cell phones and all other electronic device should remain off during school.

Its also a good thing for teachers so the phones don't ring in class and its also a good thing for students so students don't get their cell phones taken away.

Teachers wont have to worry about students talking in the restroom with cell phones or just having the phones. Teachers wont worry anymore because students wont have to hide to use their phones during the school hours just because they feel like using their cell phones. The math teachers wont have to worry because they will know that the students are using their brains and not technology for their answers.

I believe that students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and be allowed to use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Students, much like my self, need to use cell phones for many reasons during school like calling a parent, and if students cannot use their own phones, they would always be going into the office needing to use a school phone. Also, now-a-days, students can do things like check their email on their phones which is very handy when you need to see about practice times and what not.

Many times during school I have to call my mom to tell her things like when to pick me up after school from sports practice or to tell her if I need to stay late to take a test.

My parents also need to contact me when I am at school if they are running late or if they need to pick me up early. One time I wasn't able to contact my mom and she came at the wrong time to pick me up and had o wait for an hour at my basketball practice. If I cannot have my phone at school I would have many problems contacting my parents through out the day and would have to go the office all the time.

This would then become a problem for the school office. Students would be going in all the time needing to use a school phone. Plus, teachers would have to constantly be having to give out messages to students form their parents. It would be a constant bother and would make it harder for the people in the office to do their work. This would not only be a bother, but would also make the phone bill go way up and be very expensive.

We are not allowed in the building at lunch so we are not able to go on the computers to check our emails. Because we now have email on our phones we can check it to do things like get caught up on homework, check practice times for plays or games, and even email teacher. If we need to do homework at lunch but need to use the internet we can use our phones to look up things or go to a special web site.

Clearly phones during school lunches or breaks are necessities. They are much needed for things like contacting parents and using internet connection. The world of technology is moving fast so we need to move with it as a school. Please take into mind this policy.

I think you should let students used their cell phones during free periods. It would give them a chance to relax and talk to their friends while they can without being next to them. Also, it will give them more responsibility to turn off their phones when their free time is over. The students would be happier and be able to express themselves more if they were able to choose to use their phones.

Everyone likes to talk to their friends when they can. Letting students use their phones in school would let them do that. They would not have to be right next to the other person and they would be able to ask about school things if they needed to like homework and class work. Also, students would be able to get all of their talking out of the way so they are focused for when they go back to class. Other kids who are trying to be rude to people texting and talking to their friends on their phone would not be able to get into the conversation and get the other person upset.

It would be a big responsibility to have phones in school. Students would be able to use them during any free period they want as long as they got turned off when they got back to class. This would help teach responsibility more because there would be less phones getting taken away. Teachers would also get to see if their students would follow the rules and turn their phones off. Also, if students had to turn their phones off and they did, there would be less phones getting sunk into the classroom and used.

You can tell a lot about a person by the amount of time they use their phones. Some use them every chance they get, and some barely use their phones. Students at school would be able to express themselves more by being able to use their phones and the teachers would be able to know who they are better.

Girls and boys would be happier and even make more friends at school better then they were able to before. They'd be able to relate to other people more. There would possibly be less bullying because they wouldn't be able to see other peoples' conversations and make fun of them for what they say to their friends.

Students at schools always use their phones. If they were able to use them during free periods, they would be more relaxed and able to talk to their friends more often, it would teach them responsibility to turn their phones off when they go back to class, and they would be happier and able to express themselves more in school.

I would like to have you pick policy number 1. If students weren't allowed to use cell phones at school then some of the study clubs might be empty at school because of how many students have to tell there parents there going to study club. Most of the teachers response to that would be ""There's a phone to use in the office"" but most of the time the office phone is always in use and there's always a line of like 5-7 people. Once its your turn to use the phone then your parent might of had said no then you look outside and see that the buses have left already now you have to walk 2-3 miles depending where you live all because of NO cell phones.

In Policy 1 it says specifically that ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times"" in that case most of the students will have no one to text because most there friends are already with them so they can just talk face to face or if they have to advise there parents there going to an after school activity. When your in class maybe the teacher would probably be able to collect all the phones and get them after class.

I think that having cell phones at school will increase the amount of people going to after school activity's which would the school a better way of the district noticing the participation of the students making the school a better look on becoming best school.

students like me are forgetful. i have forgotten a lot of stuff at home that i needed for class or for an after school activities. if students had cell phones at lunch and free time they could call there parent and ask them to drop off whatever they forgot at home.

imagine that the school had a fire. how would you call your parents to tell them to pick you up. they probably wouldn't of even known until they came to pick you up. that is another reason students should have cell phones. if there is a fire or a natural disaster they could call home to get a ride.

imagine going to school on a Friday and getting there and finding out it was closed. if that was me i would be to lazy to walk back home, but i wouldn't have my cell phone because were not aloud to have them in school. if we had cell phones i could have called home and got a ride instead of having to walk back home.

i still believe students should be able to have phones in school. if they did they would be able to call home if they forgot something, be able to call home if something happened to the school, or they would be able to call home if school was canceled. these are the three reasons why i think that schools should let students have phones in school.

I think that we should be able to have phones in school for our free time. We barely get enough time in school for anything as it is. We get up in the morning, go to school, and attend class periods all day for 8 hours strait and then end up going home with homework in your hands. Then we get up the next morning and do as we did the day before all over again. How much does a school expect one student to handle. i don't think the principal should even have a right to allow the policy that does not allow students to use cell phones in school at all. I know that education is very important and that students should do as well as we can and get good grades. But having the right to use a cell phone during lunch period or any other free time would not affect that at all. The principal should definitely consider the policy that allows students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch period and any other free time, as long as they are turned off during class.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I believe that you should go with 'Policy 1' because I think that you should allow students to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free times, but not in class. What if someone's parents couldn't get a hold of the school and it was a family emergency. Then they could text or call their child or children what has happened. Just as long as they didn't do it during a class period.

Using the first policy might let students have the freedom to get in touch with friends they don't see very often. It is also a good idea because then students will not get distracted in class. They will focus on their work instead of worrying about their phone or texting somebody in a different class. You would just have to monitor the students carefully during class so you were sure they were not using their phones.

I also think that you might want to go with 'Policy 2' because some students would still use their phone is class. They might use their phones to cheat during a test. f you used the second policy, then you probably wouldn't have to worry at all, unless people were still using their phones. Like I said before, you would still need to monitor students either way. Though, if people went into the bathroom to text, then I don't know what you should do then. Have people stay by the bathroom and make sure people don't take their phones in their with them? I have no clue what you should do for that.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

We all need our technology right? So I believe the first policy is very fair to us as students. We should be allowed to use our phones during lunch and free times instead of no cells phone at all.

As a student we have work to be done at school we all understand that. It involves concentration and attention, but through out the day i think we should have the ability to have our freedom to use our phones. We might need to talk to parents or someone important and that may be all the time we have and need. If we were to have no phones at all were at greater risk to have even more kids using them. They wont have any other time to use them and they will decide to use them in class. What if a student has an emergency maybe has to check up on someone or is unaware of something that may have happened? They should be allowed to use there phones for that much right? I personally think so and you should too.

Restriction for our personal use of phones is unfair and out of hand for all. Policy 1 to use our phones during lunch and free time is what we need to have and keep. As a student myself you aren't going to have much good coming out if phones were band, I'm sorry to say. Cell Phone are a privilege let us have it.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I believe that it shouldn't be allowed for students to have their phones on them during school.

They wouldn't pay attention in classrooms. Students could lower their grade scores. They also could behave badly.

If students had their cell phones with them during class they could be texting during their lessons or their assignments. By doing that they could lower their grade scores because, they wouldn't pay attention to what they are suppose to do and they would be confused, and they would just end up not doing their assignments. If students don't pay attention in class they wouldn't understand how to complete their assignments, tests, and quizzes. Other students would be distracted because they could see their classmate texting during class and he or she can get distracted. That student wouldn't want to tell their teacher because that student could be scared of being disliked.

Students would take advantage of this and start sneaking their cell phones into classrooms and text their friends for the answers to their assignments or tests.

Their cell phones should be turned off and kept in their lockers. If they have an emergency they should go to the office to use their telephone. Students make it seem like cell phones and texting their friends is a necessity to everyday life, but in reality it really isn't.

This is why i believe that students shouldn't bring their phones to classrooms.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
B00B5447FE83,"I think we should be able to have cell phones on during class (Policy 1) . It's free time. It won't change our education. We could text our friends and ask them if we have any homework in the next class. If we forgot to do some of our homework, we can ask them if we check it today so we don't get detention. You wouldn't be able to ask your friends the answers to a test or the homework or anything like that.

If there would be a family emergency, we wouldn't be able to know about it. If we had our phone on, they could call us and we would know about it. We then wouldn't be left out. If a family member was about to pass away, we could talk to them for the last time instead of rushing to the hospital before it's to late.

If there was a gunman in the school, we could just reach in our pocket and tell the police where were at instead of having the phone in our locker and risking our life to get it.

Having the phone with you and on could save your life one day.

It could come to a simple thing such as missing the bus in the winter. Then you couldn't call your Mom to come and pick you up. You would need to walk home in the freezing cold. If you live far away from school, you would need to walk all the way home and risk being hit by a car if you have to cross a highway. Then you got your parents worried where you are and if your ok.

If we forgot our school project at home, we could call our parents to bring it to school so we don't fail the grade and miss the Honor Roll. Then we wouldn't have a failing grade for ourselves and if we have a partner. Your phone could help you both pass.

I think that I have some suggestions about the cell phone policy. I agree upon the first policy,"" Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time "". Also I think that students should be able to step out of class to use the phone incase of an emergency. Such as,"" A family member is in the hospital "", or things like that.

Also, I think that when students get their phone taken from texting in class, that they should get their phone confiscated and a phone call home regarding why their child's cell phone was taking from them. When things like that happens, there will be less focus on work and more focus on texting in class.

The second policy of the cell phone rule:"" Do not allow students to have phones at school at all"", I do not agree upon. I disagree on that policy because a child might have left their key at home and their parent wouldn't be home a current time and that student will be locked out of the house. Things like this happens all that happens all the time because a child doesn't have a way to get in touch with the parent's. That's why I came up with them few suggestions.

I have noticed that you have started thinking about cell phone policies. I probably would too at a time like this when cell phone numbers increase by the day. I read your two policies that you have now and I think I have my decision as well. Though I do not agree with one other automatically.

I have read the policies/ideas that you have came up with for taking care of the cell phone distraction that's been increasing the last few years. I have an idea though and it ties up with Policy 1; follow those rules and when a student is caught, have stricter consequences for their actions. For they would be allowed to have their cell phone out during lunch and that is plenty of time for a teenager to use a phone am I correct? I mean lunch is about a little over 30 minutes and students should have their phone turned off when lunch is over. I have some suggestions for the consequences if a student is caught with one on during class.

-Give the Student Lunch Detention and take away phone for the parent to get

-ISS if a student is caught texting and phone is taken away by teacher and given back at the end of the day

-Give the Student after school if a student is caught talking on the phone before or during class

(these are just suggestions I roughly thought up.)

Only let the teenagers be allowed to have cell phones out during lunch and at other times when class is not in session. At the end of day during their flex they should be allowed to have them out no other times are they permitted to be using them unless its Lunch of Flex. Other times if they have them out, give them stricter punishments each time they are caught are even caught at all for the first time.

I agree with your Policy 1 and I believe that should take effect for all the Teenagers with cell phones. You just need more punishments for if they are caught with them. That is all I have and I hope you take it into consideration for stepping up the punishment for this new thing I call the Cellphone War...",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
185B843FA452,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that it would be better for students to bring their phones to school and use them during free time and lunch time because it is not disrupting class or it is not bothering anyone either. Now, if they have it on or they are texting during class, you can let the teachers know that they can take them away from us and if we want them back, we would have to come after school and pick it up.

If the texting or using your phone during class keeps on being a problem with the class or with just one kid, you can let the teachers know that they can take it away and turn it in to your office and if we would want it back, we would have to pay whatever reasonable price you want. You can put the price on us according to how we have behaved in the last week, last couple of months, or in the whole year. If we have not behaved so good this past month, you can probably put a higher price on us so that way the student will learn his lesson and not use his phone during class again. Now, if we've behaved good and have not gotten any infractions or referrals, you can probably lower a little the price on us. It is totally up to you.

For example, lets say you warn a kid to stop texting during class and he/she doesn't obey you. The second time you see the kid texting, you may take it away. Now, if this problem continues the next day, you can take it away from him/her and have them pay whatever reasonable price you want. This will teach the student a good lesson because he/her should already know that you should not be texting in class, not just because it's a school rule but because the teacher warned him/her too.

TEACHER_NAME, i do hope you change your mind and let us at least text or use our phones for whatever reasons during lunch, free time, or in between classes when we're walking on the hallways. This doesn't disturb anyone. Does it?

968C5FD61184,"I honestly think that Policy 1 is a more reasonable choice than Policy 2. Policy 1 gives students the freedom to have their phones on school grounds and use them, but not the distraction of using them in class. In my opinion, Policy 1 is a better choice. Not being able to bring phones to school would mean students may not be able to contact Parents, Guardians, or other family members that they need to contact.

A student may need a way to get home but without having his/her phone they would have no way to contact someone to pick them up. Also, Policy 1 gives students socializing time without being late to class. Teachers wouldn't have to take up phones and distract the rest of the class because a student was using their phone. Students would have the opportunity to talk to people that they can't meet up with in the hallways, or after school.

I think teachers and students would benefit from Policy 1. If you chose Policy 2 i honestly think that students would bring them anyway and use them during class, causing them to not pay attention and make bad grades. If you enforced Policy 1 most students wouldn't be using them in class, for they can use them in free time and during lunch. Having the opportunity to use them in free time would make students more motivated to finish their work, and get things done.

There's a chance that students would fail because of them using their phones in class, and not paying attention to what's being taught.

They can have phones in school but off in your locker or pocket. School is meant for learning stuff not talking to your friends or texting to them. You can text them or call them after school. Having a cell phone in school and if your texting it takes time from learning from you, so if you have a big test and the teacher went over the stuff with you guys and you were texting and not paying attention you could get a bad grade on the test. But what is the point kids texting anyway in class when they are not apposed to.

I could see if you were after school and you had to call your mom or somebody to pick you up.

Cell phones should be allowed to be kept in school at times.

They are a students way of keeping in touch with parents.

It is also good to be used in times of emergency.

However, it can also be bad because the use of it in inappropriate situations could cause a student to not pay attention in class.

Cell phones are a helpful way to keep in touch in difficult situations, but can also be distracting in class.

Cell phones are a necessity at times to have.

Especially with how much kids are up and about these days, they may be needed to contact parents as needed.

Also, in an emergency situation like, for example, a bad snowstorm, a cell phone could help students receive the message that their ride home may be a little late.

This way they aren't blindly walking around the neighborhood looking for their parents' car.

However, this good technology comes at a price.

Without being strongly reprimanded, students would be able to text in class.

Not only is it being rude to the teacher, but it is also hurting them.

Say the teacher assigns a project or a big test.

The student not paying attention will not do the assignment or fail the test.

Therefore, if students are allowed to bring cell phones to school, teachers have to be vigilant of the facts that they might be used in their class.

All in all, cell phones should be allowed to be kept in school.

They are necessary in a modern students life to keep in touch.

However, if not addressed thoroughly, students might be able to sneak them in class, and that could be really bad.

What if there was an emergency and no-one was around you would need a phone.

In your classes and you had nothing to do you could be texting on your phone because that is what the kids are in to these days.

Some kids have there mom come and pick them up from school and after tutoring classes they would need a phone to call home and tell a parent.

Cell phones are really good acceries for kid and adults.

They give you something to do at all times.

School is not a place for a cell phone but we should be able to bring our phones. If everybody cut there phones off during classes and would not play on them during class some teachers would get a lot more done.

There would be one less thing to worrier about while your at school.

From what you have noticed is that i like cell phones, and i think we should be able to use our phones at school.

32EF13D64655,"Dear Obviously Desperate For Help Principal,

There are many students with cell phones in school. They text in class, in the hallways, and at lunch. They're not allowed to text, yet they do. It's a way of communication in school, that cannot be stifled by teachers, as the teachers cannot hear their conversation. I myself do not have a cell phone, but many of my friends do. They set up meetings, tell their parents when to pick them up, and help each other with their homework through their phones. The current policy states that students may not be seen with a cell phone any time of the day at school. However, at the high school, students can use their phones in between classes, and at lunch. I believe that this policy is the better one.

In between classes, the child might not even be in school. Their use of cell phones doesn't interrupt class, it doesn't make a lot of noise, and it doesn't make anyone look stupid. It's a quiet way for students across the building from one another to communicate. At the high school, students may text in between classes. This gives them a time when they can communicate with friends and parents without directly talking to the person in question. The temptation of texting during class would go un-satiated if the students weren't able to use the phones in the halls. It would become too great for them, and they would text during class. However, if students were able to text in the halls, they could carry on conversations throughout the day, without interrupting the learning process.

Using cell phones is a way to communicate. Most students have a cell phone, and are able to arrange things through it. It's an important way for children to talk to other people who may or may not be in the immediate vicinity. It's quieter than talking, and less disrupting than passing notes. Students need to be able to communicate in an un-stifled way. Cell phones are the way to do that.

F08130204554,"Dear School Principle ,

The constant cell phone use must stop.

Taking the cell phones away completely though isn't the answer.

The rule of you can only use your phone during your own time is would work very well since some students need their phones to contact their parents for a ride home. Other reasons could be for emergencies or to just be able to contact people they may need to speak to.

Just taking cell phones away completely if anything may only cause more problems.

Cell phones can and are very useful items for when you need a ride home.

Say you have missed the bus and need a ride home all you need to do is contact your parents to give you a ride with your cell phone. Still what if they cant give you a ride then you can just call your friend to see if you can get a ride from their parents. When your in that situation with a cell phone the possibilities are endless.

Also what if you are walking home from school or your at school and you get hurt.

You would be able to call someone for help if you had your phone.

Without your phone you would be almost hopeless and all you would be able to do is yell and hope you can be herd.

Reviewing these reasons show you why cell phones come in so handy at times they are especially needed.

Cell phones by the way the information shows it are very useful devices. They can be used for all of these things and more.

For example if you forget your homework, you can call a parent to come bring to school so you can hand it in. All of these examples show how cell phones are not just used for evil.

I in high school and the principal told all told all the students that we can bring my cell phone, but I can use only in lunch time or when I have free time. The principal was telling all the teachers that is a good idea for all the students in high school. Reason that all students have time to play with the cell phones, they can pay more attention all their classes and they can pass all their tests so they ca go to college.

In addition, all students don't have to stay bored in lunch or free time so they can play with the phones. for example if students can't bring phones every body tell every one that these high school in not fun that is so bored. Cell phones is not but. bring cell phones not affect no body. in all the school every body have cell phones. have cell phones so guys can texting an talk and this a communication that every body need.

on the other hand, have cell phones all students can pay more attention in their classes. most of the parents tell her or his son that if the pass all her or his classes they can get a cell phone wherever they want. so students can pay more attention they can do her or his homework, they can get good grades in high school and they can have permission to go the shopping or vacations or best her or his parents can buy a car that every guy in high school want to have a car. 85% of the students used cell phone within permission they get ISS

and the other 15% students used but is the principal can watch they.

furthermost, every student with cell phone if her or his parents tell her or him you have to pass all your test and you have to go to college next year you can get a cell phone. parents sometimes tell her or his son if they can bring a cell phone so students can say yes now the principal told all the students that every student have permission to bring a cell phones to school and just students can use it during lunch period or free time.

As you can see, bring cell phones at the school is a good reason for the school so students can get a good grade and pay more attention in classes and it is good that students can have time to relax to play with the cell phones and they not have to use the phone within permission in the school .Take your time to read this letter ,for that you do for us that we can use the cell phone.

E9245097F146,"To whom it may concern:

As you are well aware there has been a fierce debate over the usage of cell phones in our school.

The student body strongly supports the use of cell phones in school during free times and lunch breaks because it allows a small amount of time during the day when they can talk to people outside of school.

Teachers would support this policy because it requires that students turn off their phones during class so they can teach.

In reality this is actually a very good compromise between students and faculty.

Students get there much needed break from long classes and teachers get the respect they deserve.

This policy would help students considerably with communication between school and the household.

If students are allowed to use cell phones during breaks and lunch then they can call home if they forgot something say their homework for a class that is coming up or their gym clothes.

This would also help the faculty because instead of having to give students a note, then call the student down to sign out their parents could call their child before it's time for the student to leave so they would be ready and the faculty wouldn't have to waste their time calling the students down.

In addition, the teachers would benefit from this with classroom control.

If the students just spent their whole lunch period texting or calling someone a lot of their energy will have been spent on that instead of talking right after they get back from lunch.

Also teacher love using their cell phones as much as students do.

The question is: Why do teachers get to use their phones while students have to keep them in their lockers despite the fact that students use their phones much more frequently?

It doesn't make much sense when you really think about it.

To conclude, Policy one which allows students to have their cell phones during free periods and off during class periods should be passed and enforced because it is not only beneficial to the students and faculty but, it really is a matter of equal rights between students and staff.

I think you really should reconsider on the cell phone policy in school. The reasons why you should reconsider on the policy is so they could use it during lunch time and free time and as long as their phone are turned off during class. In this letter i will give you a little bit more detail on why you should focus on reconsidering the cell phone policy in school.

my first for why you should reconsider the policy is because students tend on leaving some stuff at home by accident. They sometimes want to call their mom and ask them to bring it to school for them. they cant do that if you wont allow them to use their cell phones.

allowing them to use their phones during lunch and free time will give them an opportunity to call their mom or also they need to change clothes because some thing spilled on them. statistics show that 75% percent of kids in America are not up to grade because they are not allowed to use their phone in school so they just use it in class. So if you reconsidered the policy kids would actually be more successful if they get to use their phone without getting in trouble for it.

Another reason why you should reconsider the policy and let kids use their phone during lunch time and free time is because. The students will always have some kind of time for them self and it will keep students more organized so for example if a student has a project due that day but they forgot to write on paragraph and that students partner is not there. if you allowed a students to use their phone they could text them or call them and say "" what should i write for the paragraph"". easily one of the students could be either writing it or typing it while he or she is communicating with the partner on their cell phones.

My last reason why you focus on reconsidering the cell phone policy is because the students wont have to sneak around during class anymore to use them so that prevents kids from getting in trouble and kids will learn more and become more successful. To make sure the student phone is off you could easily take the students phone as they walk in and check. You see allowing students to use their phone during lunch and free time is preventing distraction in class from kids not focusing. allowing students not to use their phone is causing the distraction in class.

i really hope you really focus on reconsidering on letting students use their phone in school it would be a great help to a child success in school and wont prevent any distractions. One last time i think why you should reconsider the cell phone policy is because it allows students to ask their parents to bring them something from home or clothes. it could hep children succeed if they forget stuff on projects and prevents distractions in class. thank you for your time i hope i convinced you to reconsider the cell phone policy.

I think that your first policy is a very good idea and you should go with that idea. Your second policy would just make the students very angry and make them start hating you and I'm pretty sure you don't want your students to hate you. I think that it is important for you to chose your first policy because if students didn't bring a cell phone to class and they missed the bus they would have no way of calling their parents to come pick them up and about 90% of the students don't like to go in the office and call their parents they would rather use their cell phone, another reason why your first policy is good is because your students wont hate you and they will have their phone but they will have it turned off in class and be more focused on what the teacher is teaching, and also if you took away cell phones you would have a lot of students who hate you and refuse to pay attention in class.

Missing the bus is a very average thing, at least five people a day miss the bus every day and most of those people who miss the bus don't like to go in the office and call from that phone because they are either scared you will get mad at them for missing the bus or that there will be another person there that will think them stupid for missing the bus. Most students don't have perfect grades and so some stay after school and miss their bus and calling their parents from their cell phone is a very casual thing because as soon as they get done with what they were doing in that class they can call their parents to pick them up so they get home faster. Students also like to call their parents from their cell phones to see if they can go to there friends house and that's just a faster way of calling instead of going to the office and waiting because then the friend and the person have just missed their bus. So keep the cell phones and you wont have to worry bout anyone missing their bus or too scared to come in and call from the office phone.

Your first policy states that we can have our cell phones if we only use it during lunch or our free time which is a great idea because then you will have your students focused during class and trying to have fun in that class so that they have the time fly buy and be able to text during their free time. If you take away our phones because you got us texting class, that is ok because that is totally fair because we shouldn't have ever been texting in class in the first place. So let us keep our phones and we promise not to text in class and pay attention and to only text during our free time.

Taking away our cell phones like is says to do in your second policy is a very bad idea because you will have 100% of the students hating you and a principal that has all of its students that hates them makes the school go into chaos. What I mean by that is that none of the teachers will have students willing to participate and do their work which means a lot of kids failing just because you decided to take away cell phones from the school and I'm pretty sure you don't want to run a school with a bunch of failing kids and more to come if you take away our cell phones.

So stick with your first policy and keep cell phones and we promise not to text during class and only during our free time. Going with your second policy would be a terrible thing because then you would have a bunch of students not will to participate and not having a ride home because they missed the bus and not to mention every student will hate you. So make the smart choice and keep a war off of your hands and go with your first policy.      ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

We know that you are going to make a hard decision right now but we urge to keep cell phones in school. Cell phones in school are necessary for many reasons. One of these reasons include that in case of an emergency students can call home for something. Taking cell phones away from students is like taking wings away from a bird.

In many occasions students have had to stay after school for some reason. Reasons for staying after school might be because your doing homework or using a computer or maybe just being with friends. The only way to stay after school without your parents worrying about why your not home yet or where you are is by you calling them with a cell phone during school.

If there is an emergency at school for example you fell or you feel bad and you need to go home the only way to contact your parents would be to call them and tell them what's happening and how your feeling is by a cell phone at school. Or maybe you forgot your homework so you have to call your house for someone to bring it.

Sometimes your at school and one of your parents calls you or texts you to remind you of something like a doctors appointment, or something tragic happened. The only way for you to know what is happening outside of school is for someone to either text you or call you for something important is by a cell phone. You would have to wait until you get home to hear the news if you don't have a cell phone in school.

So having cell phones in school is something that students need to have just in case of an emergency or something that you need to know right away. All students should be allowed to have cell phones in school. But if the student takes the cell phone out during class that would be different. Over all students need cell phones so do not take them away.      ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I think that the your first choice of policy is a great idea. That's really reasonable for our age, and I don't think you should have any problems, and if problems were to occur then you would just have to settle for policy two, because have gotten their freedom taken away from them.

Most kids are age our pretty mature whether adults like to admit or not, but having a cell phone during lunch period and other freedom acknowledged by teachers time seems fine. I mean, it can't possibly cut into our school work, and if a few people disobey the rule, then they should be punished, but why punish the entire group of teen before they even get a chance to prove you wrong or right?

Honestly, there's nothing that can dramatically go wrong with cell phones being a available at available time. Most guys are showing their friends what new games they've downloaded on their phone, meanwhile girls a taking pictures! What can go wrong with that? And you never know, maybe this privilege will increase students work desire to keep it! I know I'd do good to have my cell phone with me!

But if this policy because such a big problem, then their shouldn't be a problem with just taking it away. I mean, only a few can ruin it for themselves, but if it become a really big, and outrageous problem then you have no other choice but to band their freedom, simply because a few too many decided to do the wrong thing, and they'll have to deal with it!

Besides, we're one of top schools in our county, we never hardly have ridiculous discipline problems, so cutting us some slack or giving us freedom shouldn't be a problem! And a simple cell phone check before entering the class would be so easy and good for these teenagers. I think it'll make things a lot easier on you, then what you may expect! Also, they can listen to music on their phones if they possess headphones. Statistics shows that when you listen to music it automatically helps you learn and think better! But that's enough about how i feel, you're going to do what's best for your school anyway. I just think you should give us a chance to prove you wrong. Well that's all..

I believe that students should be allowed to have cell phones in school. But only can have them outside of class. If they have them during class they could be cheating on home work and on tests. I think that the first policy should go into play. The students should be able to have phones in their free time. Because if they get a call concerning family or friends they should know firsthand not being told by a teacher or another student.

But if they have them on in class they should get taken away. Because of the possibility of cheating or making fun of others through cyber bullying on cell phones. That is one thing that could get out of hand. And the school could have a big problem on their hands because of cell phones. They should not have cell phones in class they will also cause a big distraction to other students that get distracted easily and have a hard time staying on task.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
8DF397BE5387,"Principal,

I think you should have Policy 1: allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

I strongly think this should be one of our rules because like me, and many other students we need our phone throughout the day. We should have this policy because most people would be on track more. We would know what time it was, and stay on track on where we needed to be. We could also easily call home if we left homework or other things we need for school, so more people would have homework to turn in for there classes all the time. So that would lead to more people getting better grades.

Another reason this should be our school policy is that on our phone there is tools to help for math, like the calculator. If a student left there's at home, or lost there's, they could have one on their phone to use.

Another thing is that our phone could help with stress at school. if we have free time we don't want to worry about school and homework, and have a break from it all. Also, we just want to have relax, or have fun for a half hour, or an hour.

In my opinion, cell phones are probably the most important invention in the history of the world. Most of today's teens have one and use it daily. We all need to think about whether we should completely ban cell phones from the school, or if we should permit them only during free times.

Definitely, policy one, to allow students to bring phones to school and to use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time is a much more reasonable rule when it comes to using cell phones during school hours.

For one thing, giving them this freedom could make students more responsible, because the school could learn how the students deal with this freedom, to see if they abuse it or not. If students still have their cell phones on during class, we can easily tell that they cannot handle this kind of freedom. But there is no reason why we shouldn't test it out, to see if they are.

Even though cell phones are usually used for calling and texting your friends, teens use cell phones to also communicate with their parents. This could be telling parents when their sport practice ends, or where they're going after school. If parents do not get information like this about their child, they could get very worried. So this could be beneficial to parents as well as the students.

In conclusion, cell phones are a necessity to some people, and some barely use theirs. But we all know that when you are a teenager, all you do is use your cell phone. You should let us have our freedom to use our cell phones during class.

1C1B1DA16C45,"To the principal , i believe that you should allow students to bring there cell phones to school as long as they have it turn off during class because they do work all day and its like when they have free time that's our time to relax from all the work we do all day. I definitely agree with the fact that the phones should be turn off during class because they cause big distractions and even possibly be used as a cheating utensil ,so before any class begins the teacher should ask everybody to take out there phone and turn it off in front of them to make sure and by lunch time or any free time they have when the lessons are over what does it hurt for you to let them take out there phones its not doing any harm because its not during instructions .

So basically what I'm trying to say is that you should let the students take out there phones but you also never know if there's an emergency and they need to hurry and get help they would automatically have there phones with them but if you ban them from bringing there phones that's going to be a real big problem. What if there parents has something to tell them and its to that point were they can't call they school to tell them ,they can call there child, but that's my opinion on why i believe you should use policy 1 and you can also see how it goes if that strategy doesn't function very well then that's when you can move on to your second policy but you will never find out what will happen unless you try to see if the students can handle it .They need to know this a privilege that there getting to take out there phones but once again try it and see what the conclusion comes out to be, you might even be surprised.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
D66B1B59778B,"I think that policy 1 is the best decision . The reason is because we will have the phones turned off during class, then we will turn them on when we eat lunch and at passing time. Another reason is we don't have that much freedom in school we have to go straight to class, we don't get to socialize during passing time. If you go with policy 2 we might need to use our phone for something important but we can't bring phones so you should go with policy 1. Kids won't abuse the rules because this is very important to us and we want to be able to text and get on the internet during lunch. Some people might not have friends at the school they go to so they might want to text else. We will do are best in school if we can have are cell phone because this will be the best thing that happened to us so far we don't get to go outside or nothing. A problem might happen at school and no teachers might be able to reach a phone they could use one of the students phones. Finally we would really appreciate this a lot because good things like this don't happen to us. We would not mess this opportunity up because we ant to be able to use are cell phones.

I think that the firs policy is better because as long as you are not distracting the class you shouldn't need to leave your phone at home. What if you have a family emergency that you don't hear about because you don't have you phone during lunch and free times. I think that we would all think the same thing as to why we need our cell phones because you might want to talk to your friends after school to find out where you are going to hang out and wouldn't be able to because you don't have your phone. if you need to know where to go after school and you wouldn't have a phone to talk to your mom or dad to find out where to go. when we are not able to contact our family we wont want to come to this school and would maybe switch schools because there is SCHOOL_NAME, SCHOOL_NAME, and SCHOOL_NAME

Dear Ms. Principal,

Hello. Almost everyday, us students hear of a friend or a classmate that have gotten there cell phone taken away because they had it out during lunch or in-between classes. I think that students should be able to use there cell phones during lunch and other free periods because it gives the students something to look forward to after each class. Most people have cell phones now so if you keep the same rule of no cell phones allowed, you would keep pilling up more and more complaints along with a rising number of students in detention for the use of cell phones at school.

I also think that students should be allowed to have there cell phones out during lunch and free periods because If the students needs to ask there parents to bring something to school for them, they cold just send a quick and easy text message instead of walking all the way to the office and signing out just to use a school phone to call home. I'm also sure that kids would be fine with turning there cell phones off during there classes as long as they got to use them during lunch and other free periods. I hope you consider changing the rule, thank you for your time.

C478F0EDE7AC,"I believe that policy one is the best policy for our school, because what if you have an emergency during lunch or your free time and someone is trying to get a hold of you? What would you do? Or what can you do? It would be kind of hard to keep in touch with someone that can't have cell phone during lunch or any other free time. Think of it this way: If you wanted to ride your friends bus home, but the school doesn't have your mom ,that is at work, cell phone number, and all your other family members live in a different state, and Dad lives somewhere in New York. You have the number in your phone and you ask them if you can pull your phone out to look for the number, but they won't let you pull out your cell phone because of school policy. then you have to wait until after school and you still have to ride your own bus, when you other plans. I don't know about you but that would make me really mad.

What if you were at lunch and you were looking for your friends to sit with, but you can't pull out your phone to ask where in the world they are. You would get detention for texting on school grounds and you would probably have to sit in either silent lunch, with somebody that doesn't like you and always talks about you, and worse of all, sitting with a nerd. I would hate eat at silent lunch for a whole week, and probably boycott school lunches.

Do you see now? live without cell phones would be terrible. There would be no facebook slang, so then you'd have to write everything out. This is what the no cell phone policy would do to you.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
E73557CE9161,"To The Principal:

I think that policy number one would be the best option for middle school and high school instead of elementary because first almost all of the elementary students don't have cell phones so in middle school its relatively the same thing but there is a lot more who have a cell phones. Plus most kids should be mature enough already to have the common sense to turn off their phones in class because that is what our principal does all of the students that have phones have to register it into our school before it can be brought to school and at know time can the cell phone be used and it must be off and concealed. Instead this policy is better in my opinion with the ability to use your cell phone at lunch it will help kids blow off steam and maybe focus better in the later classes provided the cell phone is turned off after lunch which again is common sense. So in my opinion make this new policy happen i like it and i can abide by its rules easily and it also makes me happy because then i can text or call my friends and family at lunch so i don't have to worry about family and i can check in with friends from other schools besides that a lot of kids in high school have their cell phones out in the halls texting and calling and stuff like that plus with this new policy is obviously going to be noisy in lunch and the halls so easily just make a rule to have all cell phones on vibrate if your going to be using them simple and easy i think its a great policy that should really be set in motion for at least all middle and high schools in Maryland and all states if those states allow.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

I think policy 1: Allowing students to bring phones to school and allowing them to use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time is a great policy. However, not every child is a law abiding citizen of this beautiful country we call the United States of America. You see, we have the same exact policy at my school. when I am in class I can look all around the my classroom and see almost 20% out of 20 students texting or silently whispering in there phones. I will admit it myself I am apart of that 20%

using there phones and not paying attention in class.

Right now if I was not told to turn off my cell phone before writing this letter and taking this random NAEP examine I would be texting. There for I will have to agree with policy 1, because even thought there are many reasons students should not have cell phones in school there are many more and better reasons why they should. Lets say a student misses there bus or have an activity to do after school. The doors to the school are locked and he can't get inside and he or she lives more than 4 miles away. That is when a cell phone could come in handy.

So I am going to have to go for policy",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
98F7874839E3,"Dear Principal,

I believe that you should definitely let us use our phones during lunch periods and free time because there's no harm in it really.

Cell phones have become an everyday thing that almost everyone has and uses. You could even go as far to say that they are a mandatory thing to have. In this day and age that's kind of what it seems like.

Kids are getting in trouble all school year for taking their phones out and using them during class, lunch, recess, ect. It's really ridiculous, so if we were able to use our phones during our free time, we probably would give a little and respect that you don't want us to use them during class. Plus having the, ""no cell phone policy"" isn't really working. Kids use them anyway, and then they get in trouble for it.

But that hasn't stopped them yet, has it?

The only downside to this idea would probably be the fact that some kids might abuse this privilege and use their phone all day at school just because they think they won't get yelled at or in as much trouble anymore. You'd probably end up hearing a lot of, ""But you said we could use them!"" But it's not fair to the students who wouldn't do that and who would actually be thankful for you letting us use our phones AT ALL during the school day and respect the fact that you said we can't use them in class.

I think the you should let us use our cell phones during lunch or other free times. The reason I think this is because we might or not be able to hang out with your friends, but with our phones we could text them or call them to keep in touch with them.

Another reason why we should have cell phones is so we can call or text our parents just in case you forgot something and to remind them to pick us up. The last reason why we should be allowed to bring our cell phones is to teach us responsibility.

The first reason why we should be allowed to bring our phones is to stay in touch with our friends when we can't hang out with them. For example you have no classes with your friend. If you have our cell phones we could stay in touch and not lose our friendship with our friend. Another example is just in case we left something at your friend's house and we want it back. We would text or call our friend to meet them in a certain location in order to get our stuff back.

The second reason why we should be allowed to use our phones is so could can tell our parent(s) if they can pick us up or bring us something. For example I forgot my homework for one of my classes. I would text or call my mom or dad during lunch to tell them to get me my requested item. Another reason is that we could remind them to pick us up. We might have forgotten to tell our mom or dad to pick us after practice or something. Then we would call them to tell them if they could pick us up after school.

The final reason is to teach us responsibility. We will be more responsible by turning our phone during classes and to use them only during lunch or other free times. Then we could become more responsible with our phone and maybe with our schoolwork. See having our cell phone could actually teach us something about responsibility.

Having our phone could actually teach us something or two about responsibility. We would also be more prepared for class. Another thing is to keep in touch with our loved ones. This is why I strongly agree to be allowed to use our phones.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I believe that we should to be able to have our phones in school. I think that we should be able to use them during free time, and lunch. The reason i think this is because there a way to talk to your friends that are not at school or that are at school but your not sitting with them.

Also, I believe that we should use them during free time . Let's say there is a game or event you want to stay and watch , or participate in. You would have to call or text your parents and tell them that you are staying , and to tell them what time to pick you up. I think that we should use our phones in our free time , because if we are not doing anything it is not like were interrupting the class, or ignoring the teacher.

Another reason is, we are not doing anything else at lunch so what's the big deal with using them during a non academic time. We also have games and other fun things on our phones that we like doing . It's a different way to have fun , and yet get into trouble. Also, if we are at lunch we can show our friends something cool or interesting that we have on our phones. If you needed to call your parents to hand in a permission slip , you could just call them at lunch or in your free time.

I hope you understand where I am coming from , a lot of students feel the same way that i do about this phone policy. They also think that this rule should apply to this foundation , and that there should be phones aloud in school , but only in use in free time or lunch.

I believe that Policy 1 would be a better policy for our particular school. Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during lunch time, is a very well thought out plan.

I believe it would be better for the students, because then they would not be tempted to take them out during class. If you allow students to use them during lunch, they will not be as likely to use them during other periods. I think that if you didn't let students use their phones at all, then they would be upset and you would be more likely to get complaints from students, also.

Allowing them to use them only during lunch periods and other free time would make them more considerate with the time they have and appreciate it. I know that many students, including me sometimes need to call or text home for personal reasons, or too make sure that I have a ride home. Lunch time would be perfect for this! If you didn't have free time like this, then many people would be asking to go to the office, and call home.

Many adults may feel that Policy 2 is better, but considering that

I am an eight-grader, I feel different. I think it depends on your age and what position you are in to decide what policy is better.

Yet, I believe that Policy 1 would be better for our school in the reason's I listed above and many more. I understand others point of view's, but considering they would be tempted to take their cell phones out during lunch, anyway. I believe that you may as well, just let them have their phones out during the lunch periods, and off other than that.

Hi i would just like to let you know that i think that it is ok to let students use their cell phones during the school day because some kids might want to get into contact with their parents. Most students have to use the office phones to get a hold of them. Cell phones should also be allowed because what if there is an emergency and the school can't get a hold of anyone. Then what other options would they have.

Well cell phones are good to have in school because no one can get a hold of somebody when there is no one answering your emergency calls. My main reason that cell phones are good is that you need to understand that if somebody get into a fight you will need to call someone to break it up. cell phones in school is a real good idea because why would you use them in class. You could only use them during your free time. A lot of people really need there cell phones most of the time because they could call and have someone get help for you.

Another way that you could believe me is that you always see someone on them when they aren't aloud. Some other ideas could be that you just evaluate what is going on and see if students can handle it for just one day. Many reasons teens want to use there cell phone is that there parents can call them when they are injured. That's a reason for cell phone right there. As long as the phones are turned

Finally i think cell phones should be aloud. Why should most student suffer when they could really be used for something important. Most students could use there phone on there free time. Phones could be used as a calculator in math class if the teacher doesn't have any. Cell phones are good for a lot of things not just for a calculator also other things to.

I believe you should consider policy 2 more than policy 1. One of the reasons why you should is because, most students are not going to turn off there cell phones during class time if they know that during lunch and other free times it can be on, and if they know that their phone is on they are going to feel the urge to use it. But with policy 2 the students wouldn't have their phones at all so there wouldn't be a distraction, and if there are no distractions the students would be able to learn more. Another reason why you should pick policy 2 is, because in policy 1 students might want to ditch class in order to get more free time to use their phones, but in policy 2 you don't have your phone so you would have to go to class!

I know most students won't be happy about not being able to bring their phones to school but, I think if you do go with policy 1 you would get a lot more trouble then just going with policy 2. This is what I believe is best for the school, hopefully this helps you make the decision about choosing policy 1 or policy 2.

If you take a lot of phones away then you might get them mixed up which means parents calling, the school having to buy new phones, a lot of school money that could buy books wasted because of all the phones being taken away.

Then if you did the first policy you would know that we had our phones off during school so no one would be texting during school. Another reason policy one is better is because we could call or text a family member or friend and tell them about an important meeting. Then if one of your family members are sick you could call or text them and see how they are doing. You could listen to music at lunch on your phone. If you was in a hurry for your next class you could take a picture of your homework assignment.

Then at lunch you could play games on your phone after you got done eating. You could take pictures with you friends .So the best policy that i think is the best is policy one.

You have every right to ban cell phones from school and I understand that cell phones are a distracting liability to our learning, but please don't. Have faith in your students and trust that they will not abuse of their privilege to use their electronics in school. We promise to never use them in class or during a test because none of us want to be in any way embarrassed and on top of that, have our tests confiscated. Also, we could use our cell phones in case we forget things like lunch, homework etc, etc. Also, what if a classmate is absent? With our cell phones at hand, we could text them the homework and tell them what we learned about in class so they don't completely miss out.

You are probably questioning the first policy because of the chance someone may abuse this privilege and cheat but I promise that will not happen!! Because, see, none of us would risk getting our phones and tests taken away all at the same time because we were caught cheating. Also, none of us would want to bear the guilt of having taken away all of the other students' cell phone privileges. We would also probably not risk getting embarrassed by the teacher in front of the whole class either. So really, there is no reason we would use them in class anyway.

Also, what would happen if a fellow classmate was absent? Instead of taking focus off our own class work because we were also writing down the homework for our absent friend, we could just keep writing our own notes. And afterwards write the homework down. Only after the class would we, simply, text them the important parts of the notes, tell them what the teacher talked about during class and what we worked on and afterwards, tell them the homework that was assigned. So the next day, the absent classmate can come with no worries or stress about the work they missed.

I think the policy should allow us to have cell phones. There are certain reasons why. But i also think that if students get carried away using them until the fact that they use them during class that they should take them away from the people using them at that time and return them at the end of the day. I only like to be fair because I would love the chance to get to have my cell phone out. I will explain more about why i think this in the paragraphs below.

Lots of people get sick at school and need to go home. Some people stay in the restrooms and call or text their parents to come get them but the calling noises always bring attention to teachers and you usually get it took. If your sick and have no way to call your parents from the office then you should be able to call or text from where ever you are. But if it comes to a point where people are skipping class to go text then they should take that privilege away.

Almost everyone has a cell phone and love to text their friends. But when it comes to the no cell phone policy at school well trust me I understand. hours without calling or texting is like a day without happiness. You hear all these other kids calling and texting in class but don't get caught, then you try it and you get caught and your phone gets took by the teacher. You could never understand why that happens so of course you feel like your trapped without your cell phone.

The no cell phone policy is unfair in my opinion. We all love our cell phones and never want to have to put them up. This is why I am agreeing to the policy allowing cell phones in free time and not in class. No student likes to give up their cell phone. And I completely understand them.

I think that kids should only be able to use there cell-phone if there is an emergency or before school they can use it or after school that's the only time kids should be able to use their phone. If they do take it into school they should keep it in there locker or off in there pockets if they bring it into class. I think this is a great idea because kids could just pull it out of there pocket and start using it when the teacher is not looking or paying attention. For example kids in my school play with there phones when the teacher is not paying attention or looking then they laugh about what's on there phone so then the teacher has to stop teaching and r remove the phone from the kids and then the teacher keeps it till the end of the day. Then the kids mom or dad has to come to school to get it from the teacher. In my school if you get caught with a phone the principal takes it and calls your parents to come to school and get the phone from the office.

If my mom had to come and get my phone she would take it home and put it somewhere i couldn't find it then I would be grounded for a month. Then when I would get it back I would have to put in my locker so i wouldn't get it taken away again. Just like in the video I watched before I had to do this writing piece some kid was using his phone when the teacher wasn't looking and kids open a book and then use there phone inside the book and text somebody so the teacher doesn't know what they are doing.

I think that the use of cell phones during free times and lunch time is a great idea and also keeping them off in the classroom is a good idea because if you don't allow them at all the students will just bring them any way and get in trouble for it, but if you go with the first policy they will bring them but only get in trouble if they take the phones out in class and it is not off so what I think is that they should be allowed at lunch and other free times but off and out of site during class time.

This is a good thing because many kids will get in trouble and get their phones taken up if the other policy is put in place instead of the First policy for the kids will bring them anyway so that is what I think but the decision is up to you and I know you will make the right choice but I ask one thing choose wisely. For on one hand is trouble and on the other one is peace and tranquility but as I said before it is your choice so with that I say goodbye and happy choosing.

I think that policy one is a better policy than the second one. If policy two was a rule, then students wouldn't care, they would still use their phones during classes and they wouldn't turn off their phones, but if policy one was a rule than they would probably follow the rules instead of using the phones when class is in session.

Students would be able to use their phones if they need to contact their parents and or guardian. This is why the you should allow students to have their phones during lunch and free time as long as the phones are off during class periods. When ever an adult says to do something, it seems as if the kid does opposite of what they tell them. So if you make number two a policy, students might choose to do the opposite of that rule.

Now i know that you would rather want to have phones off during school hours instead of having students having their phones out at all. If they were to follow policy one, life in school would be a much better way to contact people we need to contact. So all that I'm saying is that we would love it if policy one was the new phone policy.

Students have many, many friends. But where do they get these friends? Mostly from school. There is no reason to have your phone out during school because whoever you are calling or texting is at school with you. Students should not have the privilege of having their phones at school because they will lose concentration on school work.

The reason cellular phones were made was to converse with your friends and family. The reason school was made was to educate you and help you later on in life. Phones and school do not mix well. The students interacting through the text messages or phone calls will be more concentrated on their conversation. You can communicate with your friends outside of school instead of inside. In Policy 1 the students would be allowed to use their phones at lunch but the person(s) they are conversing with might be in the same lunch as them or in class at the time, so there is no real point in text messaging them over the phone when you can go talk to them during lunch or when you pass by them in the hallway.

A cell phone as (many people know) does numerous things: You can check your E-mail, go on the internet, listen to music, watch videos etc. But there is no need to do that at school it all goes back to the same point, students have time out of school to do it so why don't they do it then? At school they see their friends. There is no need to converse with them on the phone when you can do it face to face.

Phones are a distraction, this is coming from an everyday student. At home I text whilst I do chores and it distracts me and I take up a lot more time to doing these tasks. It goes for the same in schools, if a teacher gives out homework at the end of the class period and the students have five minutes to work on it, how many students do you think would take out their phone and say they finished the work given to them and that it is free time? What if other students were still working on the work and the sounds from the phones were distracting them? A school is NO place for a phone and no matter how many students get angry about no phone privileges it is better for them no matter what they think! The phones are distracting and get the user off task. I say that no phones should be used during school.

I think that policy one is the best policy to choose. I think its the best because kids these days enjoy to be on their phone whether its talking or texting or maybe even playing some games. I also think that it is best to use them during free time or during lunch periods because if we use them in class we will become unfocused and get bad grades and not do the work that was assigned to us because we were to busy on our phones talking to other people. Kids entertain themselves with their phones. I think that policy one is best for the kids. So they shouldn't be able to complain about this policy because they have enough time in lunch periods to talk or text. Plus they get more than enough free time in our classes. I also think that policy one is the best because what if one the kids have to use their phone because they are hurt or have something private like if they got dirty or that they got sick, they have to tell their parents while they are in school. But if policy two that's not going to be able to happen and the kids will be mad.

I believe that policy 2 would be more efficient because cell phones are distractions to kids at school. Kids hide cell phones from teachers when they are texting even if there is a rule that told kids that they could only use them at lunch time. Kid's cell phones are often stolen or lost at schools because they were not responsible enough to leave them at home.

Kids text all the time when there at school. Anytime the teacher is not looking, kids pull out there cell phones and start texting. Texting during school allows students not to learn as much as they should be. Bringing a phone to school can also distract the other students if it goes off in the middle of class.

Most of the time the teachers don't see the students pull out their phones in the middle of class. If teachers do catch them, they only penalize them for keeping it to the end of the day, but that wouldn't stop a student that texts all the time at school. If a teacher does catch a student texting they should suspend them for not paying attention to what they are learning.

Most kids leave their phones in their back pack when they go somewhere. At dances or any other activity that makes them leave their back pack in the open where someone can easily open their back pack and take it. If kids leave the phones at home they probably won't get their phones taken.

Cell phones are good and useful to have, but not at school. At school kids get distracted when texting. Most teachers don't see the student texting and the students could lose their phones. That's why you, the principle, should ban phones from school.

I think we should be able to use our phones during lunch periods and other free times because we are not doing anything, we are not doing any work, and we are also not disturbing anybody. But the phones should be turned off during class because when they receive a text message or a phone call , it distracts them from learning and listening to what the teacher is saying because they want to check it and if the teacher see the phone out they are going to want to take it and make your parents come get it or they can hold it until the end of the class.

I am not saying this just cause I am a student, but because I see teachers getting mad at the students for doing things they should already had time doing before or after class. I see a lot of students texting instead of reading and doing the same thing when the teachers back is turned or not paying attention. It makes me mad at the student for being so mindless and the teacher for not caring. But if we did have the privilege of using our phones then we could say what we need to say and be done with it. Also i don't like the idea that the principle would not let students bring their phones to school because 1. How would we get home if we could not call for a ride?

Would you deprive them of getting updates via text? I think if its the right circumstance you should be able to use your phones. Like if your math teacher runs out of calculators and you don't get one, you should be able to use the calculator on your phone. Maybe music calms you down and you have some on your phone and you are too stressed about some personal problem and they cant focus on they're work, this has actually happened to me.

Some kids are so shy that they don't even talk to their teachers and those kids might think that the class is too hard or the teachers are mean or something if we were allowed phones out in class he might feel comfortable.

I would prefer if you choose policy 1.

The reason why I would like policy 1, is because we are never aloud to have our phones out at the school day; although a lot of kids do anyway. I would like it because i would be at lunch and free times and what's the big deal about that? It's not like we would be hurting anybody. the only trouble would be if you dropped it and someone stepped on it, or if you left it on the table and somebody took it. Although if someone took it would be your fault.

For an example what if you forgot your gym clothes or your lunch money? If you had your cell phone then you would be able to call a mom or dad or anybody to pick up your stuff and bring it to the school. Or if you had an F in a certain class, and you left your project that would get you a B in that class, you could call someone to drop it off.

The bad thing about it though is that you probably never be concentrated on any of your classes or maybe just about anything. Another bad thing is that if you have any kind of text that day, you could go onto your phone or the internet on your phone and get the answer, plus if you get caught you would be in really big trouble, you would fail the test, and your teachers probably not trust you forever, or atleast for a long time. I just listed some bad thing, but remember in the beginning of the letter I listed a whole bunch of good stuff? That is what you need to focus on the most, not the bad stuff. Also i bet that a lot of kids would agree with me when i tell you this; teenagers need their cell phones or they will die.

well not actually but the thing is to a lot people's lives, their cell phone is like their lives. and without it, they will fall apart

I just do not see a lot of bad things about cell phones. Well that is about all I have to say. Take care and please try to think this whole thing through, THE END.

Dear Principal,

I was Looking Back at your two policy decisions and in my opinion i believe the first one is better. Also, You should let us use our cell phones during lunch and break time because we may need to communicate with our family or friends. Also, Our brains will have a little brake of studying. I understand that during class we need to turn them off. Wich means we wouldn't get distracted in our education.

In the other hand if you choose the first policy of no cell phones during school. Students will still use them and it will become a bigger problem because they will use them during class. But if you let us use them during brakes and lunch we will not use them during class we will wait until brake or lunch time. Many students will even attend school more often because they will start respecting the new policy that benefit them but also the school .This is what i think about the first policy. We never get to use our cell phones in school and if you just will give us this change we will even try harder in school. Please make the correct decision that will benefit us both. And hopefully you will understand why we want the first policy. Thank you for your time.

I believe Policy 1 is appropriate, because letting students use there cell phones during their free time is not hurting anyone. The students should be aloud to use them only during lunch periods though because if the are free to use them during transition periods then they may tend to tell answers to homework or test.

Another reasonable time is before the bell rings in the morning before class starts because that is another free time that would not effect there school work.

If the policy allows students to use cell phones during other free time periods besides lunch and morning free time, then I believe that students may forget or just not turn off their cell phones and then that may effect their test scores, even their overall class grade.

I would give the students chance at this Policy and then if there is any problems caused by it then the Policy should be banned completely. The question is will the students follow the policy, so I leave the judgment up to you.      ",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

You should consider changing the call phone policy to Policy 1.

""Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.""

Policy 1 should be picked because the policy allows students to bring cell phones into school as sometimes students need to use their cell phones after school. Students keeping their cell phones off during class time but allowing students to bring the cell phones in school will allow students to contact their parents after school. Policy 2 does not allow students to bring their cell phones into school is too restrictive on students. Allowing cell phone use during lunch and other free time is also a good idea. Students can use the phones to contact other people outside school and can contact heir parents if they need to.

Students should be able to have there phones at school. the reason why is because phones bring joy to anyone at school. Also instead of having no control you'll some control over them because you know what they say '' if you can't beat them join them"". Also if some one gets there phone stolen its not really your fault they chose to have them out you weren't telling them to have it out. Another reason is that it will stop kids from texting in class because they've texted enough outside. this will make every ones life easer. I believe that since you give them the opportunity they will do so. also it will improve friendship because the shy people will no longer be shy and they will spread there wings and fly. What is also good about is that if there is an emergency every student can get help. another thing is that a phone has basic needs like calculators so it will serve as a helping hand. But one thing is needed to be done it is that phones needed to be collected before a test because that can be a contributing factor to grades. So in conclusion policy one should be accepted.

You should do policy number two because if you do not allow students to have phones at all during school things will become easier.

Cell phone use is making the learning process more difficult for the teachers.

The ring tone of the phone goes off during class it will disrupt the class. Students wont be able to do their homework because they will either be talking or texting on their cell phones.

When they are given a reading assignment the are talking on their cell phones.

If students use their cell phones all the time they wont be able to learn.

If you chose policy number one it will be frustrating for the teacher to teach class.

The kids will be sneaking their cell phones putting them on silent and hide them behind their books or every time the teacher turns around they hide it in their pockets.

Teenagers today are already abscessed with their cell phones so if you let them use their cell phones their grades will go down.

If they could use them at certain times during the day, I think the kids would be less tempted to use the phones when they are not supposed to. I think i speak for all students that it would be great to use cell phones at the appropriate time during the day.

Many kids text during class when they aren't supposed to. I feel they do that because, there are so many rules on what you can and cannot do. At times, you just want to sort of rebel against some of the rules. If we could text during our lunch break or when we have free time in class, students would not feel the need to always have their phone out. It would be a great idea to let the students have their phones and use them at the appropriate time.

If students were not able to bring their cell phones with them to school at all, how would they be able to get a ride home? Or if there were an emergency and needed to call a parent. There are many reasons why students need their phones at school. It would not be good to take the privilege of having a phone away from the kids. The school does not pay for the students phone or have anything to do with their property.

I think the school should most definitely let the students use their phones during the day. Temptation to text when you are not supposed to would probably be lowered.

308DA02A219C,"Dear Principal,

I believe that you should allow kids to use their cell phones during lunch and free times. This would make it so that kids are less tempted to use their phones during classes because they no longer have a reason to. For example, children won't text their friends while pretending to read, as shown in the video. To make sure that the cell phones are turned off before returning to class you could have a check done before leaving lunch and free periods by the school staff. Also, many times students rely on school to see their friends and if you aren't in any of their classes these cell phone times allow you to talk with them. Having a cell phone is very important to some kids as well as parents. Many parents feel safer knowing that if they need anything or get into trouble they can just call or text them. Another reason cell phones should be allowed is that kids will have more flexibility with after school programs. They will be able to call their parents to see if they can attend things like clubs and sports games which increases school spirit. Although many people would say that the children would just continue their lunchtime conversations during class and break the rules, I believe that kids are more responsible. However, if any student does disrespect the rules that you have laid out then they couch in terms get and after school detention or a small punishment. Punishments can continuously get worse every time they do it. If you don't have trust in the students at your school, then they will never be happy. In a school environment being happy is very important because it is easier to concentrate on work. Feeling like you have a little amount of power is better than thinking the school controls everything you do. Allowing kids to have phones in school gives them that power.

I heard you are considering changing the school's cell phone policy. If you would please take the time to read this letter, I would like to give you the perspective of a student.

I think the best policy, would be Policy 1. This policy would allow students to use their cell phones at lunch and free times(passing period, etc.) I think this would be the best policy because you never know what is going on in a student's life. Maybe their grandmother is sick, and the only way they think they can get through the day is by getting updates from a relative who is with her.

Another reason you should highly consider Policy 1 is because maybe they really need to tell a parent something straight away. Like where the keys are, or how to change a flat tire. These sorts of things could prevent accidents or later problems.

One of the most important reasons you should decide on Policy 1 is because, teenagers don't listen. Sure you could go with Policy 2, but how many of them are actually going to abide by it? Whether you want them to or not, students will have their cell phones out. Either in class or at lunch they will not willingly follow Policy 2. They will find ways to sneak around and use them, so why not go ahead and give the a time and place to do it? If you give them times they can, they will be less willing to disobey the policy later. They will be grateful for the time allotted and will use it wisely.

So basically if you want the most effective and most accepted plan, I suggest Policy 1. It will give the students the little freedom they crave, while also giving the teachers a ring tone free classroom. Thank you for your time, and I hope to be hearing from you soon.

Us students want to help with the cell phone decision. We understand this is a hard decision. But there are many reasons why we should keep our cell phones. first we use our cell phones in case of an emergency. Next we also use them to call are parents.

First, we use our phones for emergency's. If the nurse wasn't at school and we felt as if we broke our leg we can use our phone. We can also use our phone if we get sick. Also when girls have there personal problems we can use it to call our parents. the phones can also be used to text a sick friend the homework assignment. This is some minor reasons we need our phone.

Next we use our phones to call our parents. Some students may need to call there parents incase they need a ride. they may also have forgot there phone and need someone else's. Students need a phone incase they forgot there uniform for a sport they do. this is why we should keep our phones.

Finally there's some reasons you may want to band them but there minor problems.

One of them is because students text during class. But the teachers can just take them away. The students also listen to music. But just besides these two minor problems keep cell phones.

p. s policy two is definitely better.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
8BA0BFC49C4F,"To the Principle,

The policy I think you should put in affect is the first policy that allows students to have their cell phones in school but it cannot be present or used during class times. I choose this policy because it seemed reasonable. From pass experiences I found myself in situations where I needed to use my cell phone and I wasn't able to. One reason why she shouldn't pick the second policy the one that says no phones at all is because of safety. What if one doesn't take the school bus and left their t-bus money home how are they going to reach their parents and tell them they have no money? Little situations like this can happen everyday and this may cause frustration among parents and guardians.

The second reason is because the second policy is just unfair. From the pictures I've seen in the video not all the students were on their phones. Some were actually doing their work so putting policy number two would just make innocent people suffer. School is a place of learning new things and experiencing things you wouldn't at home so if students want to text and talk on their phones I say, let them because their futures are in their hands and if they want to talk to their friends and text about what boys they are going out with or what they are doing after school I think that's their problem.

Take it from a student, most rules are broken so I really doubt students aren't going to stop bringing their phones to school for example in our school gum isn't allowed but students continue to bring gum and chew it in school the rules and the detention doesn't stop them. But if you make something reasonable and fair maybe the usage of phone doing school hours will stop. It's 2011 thing are changing many teens and now kids have phones. I'm pretty sure the reason their parents bought it for them is for communication, with them I may add. So if you take that away who will they be able to communicate during a emergency. Yes some students misuse their ability to use phones but you shouldn't everyone.

I think policy two is the best way to go.

The use of cell phones in school would be a great idea.

I feel it gives the students a better advantage in their social life.

It is fine to have the phones in class, but the students should not be on them while the class is going on.

The use of your phone during free time seems like a wonderful idea. It gives the students something to do during the break period in school.

But with this opportunity comes rules that will have to be followed, if the students wish to continue having phones. The phones are allowed but they shall remain off in your classrooms, they are not to be ringing at any point of the day. It shall remain on silent or vibrate. If theses rules can not be followed this privilege will be revoked. If you will have the students and their parent sign some type of agreement. Stating that they are aware of these guidelines, everything shall be all good.

The use of cell phones would be a wonderful thing for you students. If you allow this, we will try our absolute best to follow the rules and regulations that you have set.

A2B42DA41507,"Dear Principle _______,

Cell phones should be allowed in schools, but only during lunch periods or on their free time. Cell phones are a very big distraction for a student, especially if they're a middle or high schooler. Many schools these days don't really care if a student has their cell phone out during class. But having their cell phones out is hurting themselves and their education.

For example, like I said before, cell phones is a huge distraction. Especially for their education. School is for learning, not for talking or texting their best friends. Texting can affect how a student can learn. Instead of paying attention to what the teacher's talking about, they might be paying attention to the plans they'll be doing this weekend. Having your cell phone out during classes is a huge problem, but during lunch periods or their free time isn't that much of a bad idea. For example, maybe a student needs to call their parents to see if they can go over to a friends' house after school. Or they need to see if they'll be getting picked up from practice. Students can do that during their free time, which isn't bad at all.

Secondly, texting can affect a student's grammar, punctuation, vocabulary, and their spelling. It could basically hurt their English education. For example, ""hey. wats up. do u wan2 go 2 my house 2nite"" That sentence there has a major problem! If students get used to texting like that, they might as well get used to writing and typing like it. There were many errors in that sentence. For example, that sentence didn't have any capulization or the correct punctuation. There were many spelling errors and numbers and words do not make a good couple at all. Texting will affect a students' education with how they portray their words and writing them.

Lastly, with the subject of their education, if students have their cell phones out during class, it can cause to cheating. If a quiz or a test is taking place, students can easily whip their phones out of their pockets and text their friends the answers to the problems. That, I think, is totally not acceptable. Also, there are tools on a cell phone that a student can use to cheat on their assignments or tests. They can use their calculator in math when they are not supposed to, or they can use a dictionary to look up a word or definition when a calculator is not needed. A cell phone will not also affect their education, but it can help cheat with it also.

As a result, cell phones are only used during free times, not during school. Communication with friends and family electronically is not appropriate during classes. School is meant for students to learn and get a better education. Although cell phones aren't acceptable during classes, they can give a student in much use in case of an emergency. All in all, cell phones and school are two different things that should not be combined together. It can hurt a students' education such as cheating, as a distraction, and with their grammar, spelling, punctuation, and vocabulary. Cell phones should not be allowed in use during classes but only during a students' lunch period and their free times.

In many schools, cell phones can be a big problem. Teachers catch students texting instead of paying attention in class and constantly have to tell them to keep their phones turned off or take them away. Many administrators ban cell phones from school, as suggested by Policy 2, for fear of students texting answers to each other for tests and distracting them from their lessons. While this may seem like a appealing idea in many ways, students need cell phones at school for important reasons besides talking to their friends.

A lot of students participate in extracurricular activities after school. Activities such as sports, clubs, and performing arts practice after school and students have to arrange for a ride home. Students need to have cell phones at school in order to contact their ride to tell them where to pick them up, if there is a time change or practice is cancelled. After school is over most schools are locked or students are unable to reach school phones.

Cell phones are needed to make contact with a student's ride and make sure they arrive home safely.

Another reason students need cell phones at school is to make sure they have all of their supplies for the day. Say you forgot your science project at home. You could use your cell phone to call your parents or a neighbor to ask them to drop it off at school.

You may also need to schedule a meeting after school for a study group or project.

You could use your cell phone to contact the group members, schedule a meeting place and make sure they know what to bring. Having a cell phone can help students be prepared for learning and improve their study skills.

Allowing students to have their cell phones at school is an important part of their safety and enhances their learning ability. Unfortunately, they can be distracting, which is why

Policy 1 would be the best choice. With the phones turned off during class time, students could stay focused on the lesson, but still be able contact friends or family if they need to.

I believe we should have our phones at school, that way if something happens we can call our mother or father. So they can come get us. We should have phones out at lunch that way we can talk with our friends from a other school, and with our friends that our out they day. And if they are anything like me they love to text.

But they are to scared to get it out, to text their friends so it just stays put up and turned off. Un-till they get on the bus and then they text a way. But we should have our phone so we can text our mother and father and tell them what is going on and if we are doing good or if we don't feel good and need to go home.

But most people have a phone so they will all say the same thing i am, because they love to text to. If you have a phone then you love to text. And they would love be get them out at lunch or free time and take picture and listen to music.

And i know i would love to get my phone out and show it off and show what i got and stuff like that, but i will also let my friends who don't have a cell phone play with mine and stuff. I do it all the time, i like to let my friends use my stuff.

I get sick a lot so this way i can text my mother and tell her that i don't feel good and then she will come get me. But all child have something that's not right going on in the life an just need to text their family and see how they are doing and what has all happened.

For example after a test when the teacher gives you time to read or do your homework, I think that's when kids would use them. They would use them when a teacher is not looking, or even when the teacher is teaching. I think most kids would like this rule because they would be aloud to use there phones and not get in trouble.

868D445794AB,"Dear Principal,

I believe that policy one is the best option for the school, teachers, faculty, and parents.

In today's world almost everyone has a cell phone.

They have almost become a necessity.

From emergencies to simple messages a cell phone always comes in handy.

I believe that cell phones should be allowed because they are invaluable in emergencies and if you just want to talk to your friends.

I know that cell phones may cause a problem for teachers but with a few simple rules you can keep that the cell phone trouble from happening at all.

Cell phones are not only great tools for talking to friends, they are also great tools in case of emergencies.

From a simple thing like what time your going to be picked up at school to a fire your cell phone is always there to help.

Without cell phones I think that more emergencies would happen and more people would be left without means of communication to their parents/guardians.

In my personal experience I rely on my cell phone to talk to parents, friends, relatives, etc.

I tend to feel almost naked if I don't have my cell phone with me because I rely on it so much.

Which leads me to my next topic, casual cell phone use.

Humans have spent hundreds of years trying to figure out ways of instant communication.

I believe that the cell phone is a perfect solution to this problem.

My cell phone lets me ask my friends for homework or just chat with them.

It is simple, easy, and efficient.

Cell phones are invaluable in this modern world so why not use them?

Problems with cell phones at school can be easily solved with a few simple rules.

I realize that cell phones may cause some problems in class but these are not hard to deal with at all.

A simple rule like teachers taking away cell phones until the students parents pick the cell phone up deals with most of the problem.

I can tell you that at my school cell phones are no problem because of this rule.

The modern day student should be allowed to have a cell phone as it shows responsibility.

If the students are not allowed to have cell phones what will happen if a student brings one as at least one of them is bound to do?

If the cell phone is confiscated then the parents will not be very happy seeing as they payed for it.

That is one of the reasons why I believe that policy two is inefficient and should not be used.

As you can see from the argument above I strongly believe that cell phones should be allowed at school and that policy one should be put in use.

Cell phones provide means of communication in emergencies and they are good for casual use.

Policy two would be an inefficent rule compared to how well policy one would work.

The students would not be tempted to use cell phones during class if they know they got to use them later.

These are only some of the reasons for what I believe but there are many more.

I sincerely hope that you go with policy one.

I think you should allow students to have cell phones in school. I think that as long as they aren't using them in class it should be alright to have it with them. The only time students should be allowed to use them are during lunch periods, free times they have in school, in class if the teacher approves, but not in quiet places like the library. Students should be allowed to have them because in many schools teachers don't let the students use their phones because of either previous things that have happened or because they don't trust the students. Another reason they might not let students use their phone is because they just don't think they should. Students not being able to have phones in school can be a bad thing. For an example, if there is a fire or something bad has happened the teachers won't let the students call home or tell their parents they are alright. That would be bad for the students and the school because if the students don't call their parents they would be highly upset and it would be bad for the teachers and schools because many parents would be calling up to the school to make sure everything is okay. Another reason I think you should let students bring their phones to school is because if a student is in trouble or someone is trying to fight them they can call their parents and get picked up. This would help the students and principals/staff in the school because they won't have to deal with the drama. Another reason is because many students need their phones for numbers or directions to places they need to be after school or if they are leaving during school. My last reason is that if a close family member in a students family has died the parents can call their child to tell them. Cell phones are very important in students and parents lives. Now, if you have a child and something important happened or something happened that you needed to know about and the teacher wouldn't let your child call you wouldn't you be upset or worried? That's how many parents feel when they can't reach their child. Please consider this letter and think about how important it is for a child to bring their cell phone to school. Thank you for your time in reading my letter.

I believe that we should have cell phones in school because they are useful to us in many ways.

Say we weren't allowed to have cell phones in school it isn't fair to the students if the teachers have them on them and the students didn't. i believe everybody should be given equal rights whether that is to keep personal property or just the right to do certain things.

I think you should go with policy number 2 because the phones in school would distract the during class and they would be texting and calling everyone around the school and at lunch they should be more worried about eating the she did that and he is doing that. The ringing will distract other people who are trying to learn or catch up on there work. and grades overall will start to fall to bellow average grades for most students. Also if someone gets a hold of some one else's cell phone they could get the technology to black male the cell phone's owner and that would be considered bullying.

As you can see the cell phone policy being allowed is a bad thing because people who are failing probably already have a cell phone and text message their friends. but if you are going to band them they will have a much higher grade because they are paying attention to the teachers a lot more often then they did before.

You really should do that but don't get angry if they forget to turn off their cell phones cause a lot of kids always forgets i do. And so does my friends.

I don't believe that removing students right to have cell phones is a smart thing to do. Although it may stop students from being distracted at school, it only stops them in that small way. There are still many other distractions that teachers need to worry about more. Students should be able to use cell phones during there free time, and just turn it off during class. It doesn't distract anyone, it allows students to socialize better, and it allows students to contact important people, such as there parents.

If students only use cell phones during lunch, after school, or at other free times, it won't be a distraction. Its about the same thing as not having a cell phone at school at all, except that they can use something they want to use when its an appropriate time. As long as they are not using there phones in class. Some of you may say that even though students aren't ""allowed"" to use them in class, some will still sneak a text or two. That if you get rid of cell phones completely at school, you won't have this problem anymore. Wrong. If you consider the fact of kids still using the phones in class, who's not to say that they won't still bring them to school anyways? Plus, cell phones aren't the biggest distraction in the world. Friends are more of a distraction. It's as if you took away their right to have friends.

With a cell phone, students have the ability to contact their friends more, and maybe they can get more friends too. Everyone knows that the more friends you have the happier your life is. They can contact old friends too, to keep in touch. Friends aren't the only thing they can contact though.

Most importantly, it allows children to contact people for important things, like their parents. With a cell phone, students can talk with their parents or guardian when something important comes up. What if a student finds out there's a basketball game after school that they want to watch? If they can't contact their parents, they can't go to the game, because their guardian would worry about them. If their parents need to contact them about something important, they can just call your cell phone. Cell phones give kids better and more continent contact.

In the end, it's better to just let kids have their cell phones. If they don't use it in class, it doesn't distract their and others education. It allows them to contact friends, and most importantly family, especially when something important happens. Why would you want to get rid of that?

I believe that students should not be allowed to have cell phones in school. I have many important reasons to why i feel this way.

First of all, some students may use them when they are not suppose to. Others will take advantage of the privilege. They could possibly use them when taking a test for instance.

Some teachers are never fully aware of what their students are doing with their cell phones. This can cause major issues for not just one, but many students.

My second reason is because it is a way of bullying. Many students use technology today to bully others. If we just give students this privilege, then we are giving bullies an easier way to target their victim. Many suicides have come with bullying, and most of it was cyber bullying. Giving those students technology in school may lead to many more, unless we stick to the strict policy of no cell phones in school.

My third most reason would have to be the learning experiences. If they have their cell phones with them then it may take away their learning advantages. Having their phones may lead to them text instead of pay attention in class. If they do not pay attention, then how are they going to challenge themselves to do their best? Letting them have cell phones is taking away what they need to be focusing on, which is school work.

We have kept the policy for a reason. We have seen and heard the nasty things we can do with technology. Imagine letting student have a better advantage to do these nasty things. Please stick to it. If you do decide to let them have their cell phones, you will see what technology can really do to mess up a school. I'm just sending out the warnings before you do change it.

Students should be allowed to use phones during lunch period and other free time. Not allowing students to bring phones to school at all would anger students and cause them to use their phones anyway at any time they think they can get away with it. It would also create an unnecessary disciplinary task for the staff. Banning phones altogether would also create a safety hazard in an emergency, as students would not be able to all communicate outside of school.

In debating on whether to ban phones altogether, we can think back to the times of prohibition. Banning phones would have a similar effect. Students would simply use their phones in secret to rebel against the rule. Students would be angered that they could not bring their phones to school, creating a distraction in class that would not exist if phones were allowed during free time.

Also thinking back to prohibition times, we can recall the pains that police forces had to go through to stem the tide of bootleggers. Simply banning phones would create an unnecessary task for the staff of the school. It would be a waste of the staff's time to enforce this rule.

Banning phones would also create a safety risk during an emergency. If there were a fire or lockdown, very few or no students would be able to communicate with their family or friends. School phones are simply not adequate for the amount of kids that need to call home during an emergency, especially during a fire.

So if your still planning on banning phones, don't! Though many may say that they will distract kids, it be worse with a ban. Allowing them during free times would eliminate effects such as angry kids using them in secret and the waste of teachers time it would be.

Lots of people love to use phones, I do as well, but it should be forbidden to use them, for example: texting. Texting is very rare around America, I also love to text but it can harm you in the future because it can get in the way of your school and school work. Every time I look around and to see people use them makes me feel bad because I know how addictive it is to use them at school. I don't understand why they can't wait till after school, or just use it at home. All your doing is wasting your battery and your brain, people don't know how important it is.

I bet maybe 96% of the world's population of elementary, middle, and high school use phones for texting, or in math class when they use their calculator but that's just me. People love to use phones, and i do to, but will it get you a job? Well, maybe if you call a job application. Will it get you a degree? Who knows. And will it get you an A+ on your math test? Maybe, because your cheating with somebody else.

All I know is, you should never use a phone in school, maybe at lunch or after school, but not in classes. Because I wouldn't want to get it taking away. its happened to me before, and I'm pretty sure no one else wouldn't want to either.      ",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

I reconsider the schools cell policy 1 because it true that the cell phones are hard for people to work in school but the teacher should expect it to because the teacher are always texting when there give the class and they always think that is us only? I say that because some teacher are doing that to and, it not fair for the student's. so I think that they should use it when they are in lunch or when they are outside or when they have free time, and when there in the class to not use it or to just turn it off or if they don't want to respect what the teachers telling them to take it away and to tell them to come there mom and to pick it up or have the student to stay after school.

I think they should not use phones because what if they forget to turn off their phones and when you are talking the phone starts going off and u have to stop talking and wait till they turn their phone off or maybe the students are taking a big test and someones phone goes off

Another reasone why i believe students should not be allowed to use phones in school is because maybe you have to ask them something and they don't hear you because they are on the phone thalking to a friend about what to wear or something for a party.

my last reason for students not having phones in school is because how students have different lunch times one might text someone that is in class and than the otherone texts him back because they think the teacher is not looking at them,so if they text back that means he is not paying attion to the teacher but to the phone and that might turn into the students failing their classes.

I think you should let us students to bring our cell phones to school because we are in a growing society and we all need to communicate.

to begin with i consider all students must have a cell phone in order to text their class mate to ask about the home work from last night. or just to have a briefly talk about the test in class that they are giving or just to let the students have more freedom. also texting is being more widely used than any other devise in earth like face book or twitter they are both being used to talk on the phones know every body has a phone i am right yes because technology has been growing rapidly and faster then ever know on days you don't see that device what was it called oh yea the beeper because it took so much time to call the one typing it in and for her to send the message to the other person beeper that has become obsolete.

also phones have been one the worlds greatest inventions. in fact the on who created the first phone was Alexander gram bell and know look at the phones they even have GPS. they can take you to their destination with out problem is like the sexton that used triangulation to find your position in earth. but know they use seven GPS to know where you are and were are you going now they are more accurate they take anywhere any time any place. phones have develop allot know there even a hand free devise that you use that is not even a cord is just dangling from your ear and it its totally cool to have one i have one.

The cell phones will have to be off during class but in our free times we could use them. I think they should let us because i think its a great way to refresh your mind a little and then go back to work.

I would say also that bringing a cell phone to school is okay because we wont be using them during class only on free times. It would be better if they would let us bring cell phones to school because when a student is bored they can always refresh their mind by using their cell phones on their lunch period or their free times. That way if we bring cell phones and they don't let us students might be using their cell phones during class and their not going to be paying attention to the teacher. And if we knew that we could bring cell phones we wouldn't be using our cell phones behind the desk so that the teacher doesn't catch us. If we do that because we know we cant bring any cell phones to school we are going to be on our cell phone and we are not going to be paying attention to the teacher about what she's teaching us. If we knew that we could bring cell phones we would just wait for our lunch period to use them or on our free times. That way we could be paying attention to the teacher and not using our cell phones because we know that we could use them on our lunch period or free times.

Another reason i think we should be able to bring cell phones to school is that if we bring cell phones to school and we cant bring them we are going to get in trouble for using our cell phones and not paying attention to the teacher. Also if we don't pay attention to the teacher we wont be able to understand the work or the homework she gives us and we wont do it because we don't understand it. If we don't do our work or our homework we are going to get bad grades and our grades are going to go down. That's my other reason why i think we should be able to bring cell phones instead of bringing them when we cant and be using them in school. Most of the students that have cell phones would like to bring them to school and some do so they can be using them when the teacher is not looking at them. Another reason that they should let us bring cell phones to school is so that we wont have to be scared that the teacher might catch us and get in trouble for it. When we know we could bring cell phones to school we could just bring them off and during our lunch period or free time we can turn them on and use them without fearing that the teacher is going to catch you using it when your not supposed to. More reasons are that if you have your cell phone on during class and you forgot to put it on silent if it rings or something the teacher can catch you right away and might take your cell phone then she would tell your parents you have it and they need to go get it.

I believe that you should go with policy number two which says no cell phones are allowed in school. There are many reasons why i say this. One reason why is because most of the students will have different phones from each other. Some peoples phones will be better than others. Students will not like that so they will result to stealing cell phones. Then the school will be taken over by violence. And you don't need that in your school. Another reason why cell phones should not be allowed in school is because they can go off in the middle of class and distract the whole entire class from learning. One the phone goes off everyone starts laughing and everyone gets off task. Then everyone starts talking about the ring tone. Then the teacher has to get the class back in order because of the huge distraction a cell phone caused.

B67D550009E8,"TEACHER_NAME:

Students at SCHOOL_NAME strongly dislike the current policy of no cell phones on at school. Students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, at least, and using their phones at free times and lunch periods would be a great privilege for students to have because it would let them be more social, help them retrieve forgotten things from home, and help them find their way home.

After school some students don't know where they will be picked up by their parent or guardian. If cell phones are allowed in school, students could use them after school and not have to panic just about a small task. Most students who get picked up at school by somebody know the feeling of having to search for their ride and feeling that they are wasting their time because they could be doing something better with their time.

By allowing students to use their cell phones during break and lunch times, students would be happier because they would be able to connect with their friends and be able to be more social. As of now, students have a hard time finding their friends during free time because our school is so large. Also, this would help students grades because in many classes they are assigned group projects. If a student needs to find members of their group, and they cant find them, their grades might fall due to their incomplete project, this might make our school and teachers look bad compared to other schools. By allowing students to use their cell phones, their grades may be helped and the school will look better.

Now, when a student forgets something at home, they have to go to the office and ask TEACHER_NAME if they can call home. If cell phones were allowed to be used during free time this would not only benefit the students but it would also benefit the office and staff because it would stop students from disrupting so much. Although students may misuse this privilege and use their phones during class, allowing students would bring up the morale of the students and benefit the ladies in the office.

You should allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are off during class time. I suggest this because it would mean letting students use technology that is available to us. You should do this because some, and most, technology is educational.

Technology can teach us many things. You should allow us to have our cell phones during free time and lunch periods because it wont get in the way of our learning, due to it being in our free time. The students would enjoy having their cell phones during the available times because they complain that you should let them.

I heard that u were considering 2 new phone policies. I just wanted to give you my opinion on what policy you should consider. My opinion is to go with policy 1, because I think that students already have to go to school but they also should get to message or call friends or family about something very important. Like that for example what if a student wants to call his/her parents to go to their friends house to study or just to hang out. then their parents go and pick them up and end up not picking them up after all, so the parents just drove to their school for nothing. That's why I think you should consider policy 1 so that same example won't happen. Here's another example what if a student has a dentist appointment but she doesn't know what it is at, but if she messages his/her parents to find out what time it is at so she can get all of her homework from all of their teachers. And i' m sure students will actually listen to this new phone policy. One thing you should also think about is what are the punishments are going to be. Hopefully you are not to hard on the punishments if u choose policy 1. Well hope you greatly consider policy 1, because I would think that most of the students would like it if you choose policy 1. Well hope you choose policy 1.

If there is an issue that comes up after school then how would students get a hold of there parents or anyone to let them know what is happening. Sometimes I am told to bring my phone to school everyday but I have to keep it turned off until after school. There are days that I need my phone to contact my mom or my older brother to let them where I am at, who I am with and what we are doing. If i would like to go to somewhere after school with my friends I have to call in with my mom or my brother to tell that I am at Jamba Juice with my friends.

I have a suggestion, each student gets three chances if they are using their cell phones in class and they get caught three times for it then they will have to give up there phones every morning to the office. Then everyday after school the students will get their phones back, this would go on for 2 weeks for each student whose been caught. to remember the students name and face they will have to fill out a sheet of paper filled out by their parent's signature and brought back to school the next day along with their phone.

I can understand having them out in class is wrong but what's wrong with having them on lunch or tutorials?

I think that phone policy one is the better choice than phone policy two. I think that the first one is better than the second one because students will like it better and that students will probably not listen to the second policy if that is enforced. Students will like policy number one a lot better than policy number two. Most students with cell phones will like to keep their phones with them at all times just in case their is an emergency or if they are afraid that somebody will steal their phone. As long as they can use it during sometime in the day, most students will be satisfied and they can concentrate more in class, knowing that they can use the phone sometime in the day.

Another reason why I think the first policy is better than the second is because the students will probably not listen to the second policy. Some students will probably have their phones with them anyways during class. To the students it will be safer to have their phones with them and maybe just to be rebels, they will use it during the lessons like texting or playing games. Also, it will be better if you give what the students want or else they might think this is not a good school. So I, an anonymous student, am speaking for all the kids that have cell phones thinking that it is better to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

It has came to me that students are wanting to bring their cell phones to school and using them in school. In my opinion, I respectively agree with those students. I believe that Policy #1, ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time,"" should be enforced in our school for many reasons.

First of all, I believe that students should have access to their cell phones during lunch periods and free times in case of an emergency, the students can contact their parents or whoever they need to talk with. If the students were to need something from their home or some other place, they can call their parents ask them to come drop it off at school.

Secondly, all students in our school should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free periods because it is the students' free time to decide what they would like to do during that time, and if the student decides to use their cell phones to call or text people, than that should be perfectly fine. There is no harm in using cell phones, and if there were, then the students wouldn't even have cell phones in the first place. If the students are allowed to talk to each other during lunch and other free periods, then why can't they use their cell phones to communicate with each other?

Last but not least, having cell phones in school during lunchtime and other free periods will not get in the way of their studies, because all cell phones need to be turned off during class time. There would be no distractions during class because there will be no cell phone to be distracted from. So if the students' focus in class is a worry, then it shouldn't be, because they would only be allowed to have their cell phones turned on during lunchtime and other free periods.

I respectfully hope that you will consider my opinion on the Cell phone policy.

I have recently heard that you are debating if students bring their phones to school or not. Honestly, my say might not do you any good. But, I feel that it is a great idea. On the other hand, students that do not bring their phones to school might be an issue. How so?

you might ask. In these next few paragraphs, I will explain my doing and hopefully you will see to taking in my opinion and proposition.

Allowing students to bring their phones to school, and to use them during free time, is a wonderful idea. Also, keeping them off during class time is a good deal to at least being able to have the phones in the students' possession. It would be easier if teachers could see students on their phones and not take them away. We the students would not have to sneak the phones around school, and get later caught. The only minor problem is that students might not turn them off during class, disregarding your trust and rules. Otherwise, It is a good idea. What if something were to happen to that particular student? What if it was a personal problem and they could not come to a teacher? Reasons for having phones during school can go on for quite some time, but to keep it short and simple, It would be a great idea to have them during school. But why keep the phones away from the students?

Why can we not have the phones? Why take them away? Students need phones as if they need oxygen to breathe. It is legit that even if you banned phones from school property, students would still bring and use them anyway. There is honestly no point. Sometimes they do go off during class, but it is not on purpose. I do understand the statement that phones are in fact distracting to the students and classmates. If you banned them, students would not be distracted, or taking the risk of exposure to the phones, causing them to be possessed by teachers and administrators. What's my opinion?

In my personal belief, I feel that we should be able to have our phones. It is a legitimate trade for keeping and using the phones during free time and lunch, and keeping them off during the time of class and learning. If you allow this, students would be grateful and pleased, as well as the teachers and other workers at this school. Thank you for taking the time to examine my opinion and personal distress.

I am a student of your school just voicing my opinion. Policy one sounds a lot more convenient us. We should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school. These devices are used for connecting with someone not close to you. And I do agree that the phones should be off and put away out of sight. But policy two just seems ridiculous. You can't bring cell phones at all to school. That's just not right at all. We should be allowed to have them and use them in our extra free time. I believe we should confirm with our teacher before use though. Lets say, we couldn't bring our cells to school. If there is an emergency it would a lot more easier to get in contact with the student if they had their phones. It is a lot more heartache you would have to go through to call the school, and find out what class you in, etc. But I do understand why you wouldn't allow them. Some students abuse their power by using it during class and while the teacher may be giving instruction. But you can't put every student in the same boat because a couple of students have done wrong. Everyone should not be punished because another student chose to do wrong by the rules. Now if a phone is in use and they get caught, take it from them and they don't get it back until the end of the day. If students have phones, please permit them. We have them because its the first line to communicate with our parents/guardians. They are also to socialize with our peers and friends. I on the behalf of the student body really hope you are considering granting us the use of our cell phones during school hours only in our spare time.

I think that students of SCHOOL_NAME should be aloud to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, just as long as the phones are turned off during class.

I strongly agree with this subject. Teens in our school are getting in trouble almost everyday because they are getting their phones taken away from them in lunch and breaks in between classes. Then there are some students who don't really get what ""No phones in class"" means.

I think that you should make it so we can have our phones out during lunch and between classes, because sometimes it maybe an emergency and we need to call our parents about something that we don't want to talk about in the office phone were everyone can hear what your saying around you. Therefore if you have a cell phone you can go call your parents some were quite, were know one can hear what your saying.

This just might help you to. I am almost sure that schools have to pay a phone bill, am i right? well by letting teens use their phones you can decrease the bill, or even better get rid of all the extra phones. Then if you need to get a hold of someone in another room you have the PA speakers.

In my opinion students should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch or other free times in school as long as the phones are turned of in class. One example of why this is necessary would be if an emergency comes up and the student needs to inform their parent or guardian. Or vice versa if the parent needs to inform their child about a situation. Cell phones are a vital object in today's society. Most people depend on cell phones even tough they are not always helpful.

I know what your thinking, if we let students bring cell phones to school they will get distracted and ignore their teachers. That could easily be solved with simple punishments. Such as if a student is caught using their phone during class without permission the student will get their phone taken away. Most students care for their phones and will not risk the chance of losing their cell phone. If the problem continues other arrangements including informing their parents about the situation could also help.

In other terms if you let the students bring their phones to school with more freedom they will feel more trustworthy and there for follow the rules. I know all students will appreciate this eff      ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
D9DD8E066439,"I believe that policy number one would be the plan to go with. Yes, we are always on our phones, but why not be able to text while teachers aren't teaching and we're not missing out on any assignments, lessons or getting sidetracked from what is being taught? If the principle decided to go with this policy maybe it would even decrease how much students text and use their phones during class. If so, it would be either because we've already gotten done what we need to do on our phones before class, or we wait because we know we won't get in trouble at lunch for using our cell phones.

In many of my classes my friends text. As I stated before, if this policy were to be enforced I believe kids would text less. If the staff of the school were to keep better tabs and pay more attention to kids using their phones we would be scared out of it and just text during lunch and between classes. If the staff was to be more careful about kids using their phones but NOT let them text during free time, I believe kids would try harder to text and would do anything related to their phones more often just to be mischievous.

Although policy #1 has it's exceptions, limits, and cons, it might even help bring grades up with struggling kids. If they knew they were able to text during free times then they would forget about it for the time being and wait until the designated period of when they could. Even in the better behaved, less troublesome kids I think there is a possibility of their grades raising, And maybe even attitude changes to go along with that.

As I said earlier, there are exceptions, limits and cons. Examples are when kids are sexting, cyber bullying, or inappropriately using their phones.

But all in all, I think this policy would be better than either accepting phones or shutting them out completely. The principle should go with their first instinct and let phones be allowed at some times to increase the school's over all well being.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

When we are not in class i don't see why we cant use are phone we would not be brother anybody because we would not be in class. We could just be walking down the hall. the hall ways would be a hole lot quite to because people would not be yelling.

Lets say were sitting at lunch and maybe one of your friends are sitting on the other side of the lunch room and you cant talk to them because of it well if you had your phone you could just text her and tell her whatever you were going to tell her. If you texts your friend that is all the way on the other side of the room you want get in trouble for walking over there when the rules are to stay sitting. If you text them you want get yelled at of yelling across the room.

When people are just walking around the halls or waiting before a class they should be able to text people. Lets say you have a friend that is on the other side of the school and you need to tell them something but you can not find them and it just cant wait so you text them see that's a lot better then haven to wait till the end of the day because you can tell them everything that you need to tell them and you don't for get any thing.

I don't agree with cell phone usage, it should not be allowed at school because cell phones will get other students distracted from school work, students will pay more attention to their phones instead of school work and school is a place for learning, not cell phones.

Even though students will not be able to use them during class time, it doesn't mean they still can't be distracted by them. Young students such as teens, considering I am one, will talk even more during class time from the conversations they had with their friends. Not only will the teacher become frustrated, but so will some of the students who are trying to pay attention and understand the lesson. I would know this because I already have classmates who text during class and rudely interrupt the teacher and their fellow piers by their goofy giggles and I do personally get annoyed.

When students text or call their friends, it's not just a five minute thing that happens and just goes away like a fluttering butterfly. Actually, no where near that. Students will concentrate on what gossip is going on or what your boyfriend gave you for your birthday, this severe problem will not stop unless we actually do something to change it other than just taking that rule away. I think that we should just keep this school the way it is. We are an ""A"" school and that's just how I like it.

School is a place for learning, not cell phone usage. We go to school for one reason and one reason only, to learn. Our parents want us, the students, to grow up and become successful. That is what they want most of all. And if we ignore them and our teachers what will we have after college, if some students even go to college, we will have nothing. Students would have been to busy paying attention to their phones instead of the lesson that we will be tested on.

I agree that we should just rule out that possibility and stay in the safe zone. It will be better for the parents, teachers, and especially the students. This is why I agree we should not have cell phone usage during school hours at any time.

I think that both policies are good but I would rather policy 1 because you would have more kids not leave school early or skip school or get in much trouble. The only thing though is that I don't agree in having them out in your main course classes. For example math, science, English, and history. You might not get what I'm saying or maybe you do. The point I'm trying to make is at least make it where we can have them out in the hall and extra fun classes also our tutorial classes. The only thing your thinking about when i say a lot of kids wont get in trouble your thinking, ""yes they will and this is a bad idea to do this"" but no not really all you have to do is send a letter to all kids saying that they agree to NOT have their phone out in their main classes. If some students don't turn in their agreement then you write their names down so you know but most likely your going to get every ones agreement because anyone would love to have their phone at school at some point. Just think back when you were in this and you had a phone wouldn't you want to bring it to school and play on just a little in the extra classes that we had? You should try for just a month and if you don't like it you can change it back to normal.

I think that more people would love coming to school if this and dress code both change.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I believe that Policy 1 is better.

I believe that this policy is better because; one, it gives the students to have a ""free"" time and to be able to get their minds off all of their school work and it gives them a chance to communicate with other people, and two, I believe that having a cell phone out during a lunch period does not interfere with how the students learn.

Policy 1 would let the students have more freedom then they would normally have and I believe that when students get to have freedoms, like this one, they will behave better because they will not be trying to sneak and check their phone during their class period.

Whenever I see a student checking their phone during class time, it does distract me and I believe that if students would be able to use their cell phones during other times throughout the school day, then they would be less likely to try to use their phone during class.

Policy 2 doesn't let the students have any freedoms with their cell phones, and when students know that they don't have any privileges with their phones, they try to get away without anyone noticing them using it.

Although most students listen to the policies when it comes to their cell phones, some just don't.

Most of the students listen because they either don't want to get their phone taken away, or they don't care that they can't use their phones during the school day.

Then, other students don't care if they do or don't get caught using it.

I would like you to consider my thoughts and ideas about the cell phone usage during the school day and maybe also consider changing the policy.

I appreciate you taking your time to read my letter.

I agree with policy 1: that students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them at lunch but they have to be turned off in class. Because what if they need someone in their family in the middle of the day or if their family has to get a hold of them. If they are on in class and go off then you can tack them away but if the are on in the morning on the patio i think that it is ok but not in class when they get to lunch they can use them because i would like that. But if the are in the lunch room then they should be turned off because they have to in class so they should be in the building because that is rude if some one is talking and a cell phone goes off it would be good if that was the new rule in the school. I think that it is not fair for the teacher to get to use their cell phones and not the students.

I think that policy one: that the student can use their cell phones. An can be on out side and not get taken away, but when they go inside the cell phone has to be turned off if they are not and they go off they should get taken away and their parents should have to come and get them or they can get them after school or when ever the teacher said that they can come back and get them so that is why i think the policy 1that cell phones should be used only outside school and not inside the class rooms is how the cell phone policy should be in the school i hope that i have told you some stuff that will help you in your choice if cell phones should be allowed or not be allowed in school.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I think is good to have a phone during lunch , or if a teacher give us free time we can use are phones. Policy number one is good for us. I think policy number one is cool because we can use them but not on class because it can effect us at are learning and others learners to.

I think policy number 2 is not fare or all the students at are school .

because we have to call are mom after school to come pick us up after school but we don't have are phones. What about if we go walking and somebody is fooling you we can call somebody but wait we don't have our phones.

F9807DE48A3B,"Dear Principal,

I think that this choice is debatable with either outcome. If I were principle, I would chose Policy 1 because it lets the kids have their free time and not have a big deal towards the issue. One way this Policy helps is that the kids deserve to have some free time to themselves without it being all day everyday and out-of-hand. I also believe that the kids should not be punished by some students who have made this a bad idea. Most kids have Cell phones and love to text and/or call their friends or family. Another reason Policy 1 one should be used, is because the students might need something from home or have a family emergency that the school might not have information on and the only way they can reach the student is by messaging or calling them buy phone.

This Policy can also be brought the wrong way and the kids will bring the phones to class to talk to people instead of working during class time. Then, if you take away the phones completely, there would be no way of communication towards family or friends. This would also bring no social interaction at all with anyone. I believe that these are not situations that would common but they could still happen. If a student gets hurt, the school will be blamed and not the students because they had no way of communicating. This could also lead to the school being sued. I would rather be safe then sorry. So, I choose Policy 1 because I feel that this is one that will bring more happy students and parents. These outcomes might be rare but who knows? Please keep this option in consideration.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I have read both of the possible policies that you may apply to our school's rules ,and I believe that you should go with policy 1 which states that students can bring cell phones to school ,and have them on during lunch and free time because of many reasons. One reason that students should be able to bring cell phones to school is because after school the person who picks them up may have forgotten to so you would need to call them. Another reason that students should be able to bring cell phones to school is because they may have left an important assignment at home ,and if they had their cell phone it wouldn't be a problem. This may seem like it absurd to let kids bring their cell phones to school because of the distraction, but we just have to really enforce that they can not be on in class, and there will not be a problem. One more major reason that we should let kids bring their cell phones is because they may have an emergency at the school and we might have to go on lock down. This might cause us to be away from family for a long time so we would need to be able to contact them. Please look at this letter and consider it with great thought.

I think that policy number 2 is a good policy because if you allow students to bring cell phones to school then they will not only use them in lunch or passing periods i think they will be using them in the classrooms too. I think that if you allow them to bring cell phones to school then they would start using them in class too and then they wont be able to learn anything if you allow them to bring them. Also, i think they would be using them all around the school and they don't turn them off they just put them on vibrate or they silent mode them. I think it would be good if they bring cell phones but then they might get too excited then they're going to start using them every time, but i also think some should bring them because sometimes they need to call they're parents after school but sometimes they could get out of hand. They can also be prank call people or they can cyber bully someone and i know that, that wont be good for our school. They wont be learning anything if you allow them to bring cell phones because maybe when they are taking test they text each other the answers or tell each other to help. I mean bringing cell phones isn't bad but what would the consequences be if you let them bring they're cell phones? Well i think some of the consequences can be they can get lower grades, they can cheat, they can be using them in class or even cyber bully someone!

Most students would think since the principal allows them to use there phones during lunch it would be okay to use them anytime they would like. Which is taking advantage of the privileges that they were allowed to do. In a school you must have strict rules or else the students will think that they can do whatever it is that they want to do. For example the students are glad they can use there cell phones at lunch but RELATIVE_NAME [example] decides since she can use here cell phone during lunch that she can use here phone in math class. The teacher catches her and then confiscates her phone. RELATIVE_NAME gets an attitude and then possibly the teacher goes to talk to the principle about the policy 1 because he has seen so many students that think its okay to us there phones whenever, and wherever.

I think cell phones should be allowed at school. I think they should be allowed at lunch and all the other free periods. So I agree with Policy 1.

What would a child do if they had an emergency and they needed to call or text their parents for help? If cell phones are banned they couldn't do anything or risk having their phones get taken away.

On the other hand they should be off during teaching times, so that they wont be distracted. Also if the child is using their phone during school and someone takes it or they lose it, that is their fault. I also think if they are caught with their cell phones, they should lose the privilege of having it out during breaks.

I think that Policy 1 would be a good decision for the school. In many cases students must use their phones for after-school activities and it might become a problem if the students do not have their phones with them at school. Most parents often feel safer when their children have their phones with them at school. So in my opinion, it should be the parents decision if they want to allow their child to bring their phone to school or not.

A big deal for teachers is that the students are paying attention to their phones and not the lesson in class. With this policy it would allow the students to be able to socialize without doing it in class and disturbing others. This policy states that they would only be allowed phone use during free times and then turned off during class, so the teachers should not mind this situation.

Another thing is safety. In the case of an emergency these students would be able to help contact emergency services or simply call their parents to inform them that something has gone wrong. If you decide to go with Policy 2 these students would not be able to contact their parents at all until they get back to their phone. This could cause many problems for many people.

It seems like everyone uses a phone, may that be texting or calling or getting information. Policy 1 would let students be able to do these things at school during appropriate times. In my view point, there is not anything that would seem to go wrong in this situation.

I have heard of other schools having this routine before so I do not see why it would not work for this school as well. I think, personally, that Policy 1 would be a good choice to have at this campus. Teachers would not mind, parents would feel safer and the students at this school would enjoy this privilege.

I think that our school should have cell phones in school. I believe that if we all had our cell phones everyone will listen to what you say. If you do this the teachers that are watching the students will be looking if they have them out in lunch or their free time. The other reason you had maybe wouldn't work and students will bring their phones to school secretly. If students don't fallow the policy and use them in classes then it will make it right to take the policy away. The second policy will make the teachers more alert and make the teacher teach slower. This will make them slower because they will be checking every time. I believe that if students have their cell phones at lunch that they won't be asking the principal as much.

I am for policy 1, because of many reasons. Policy 1 does state that cell phones can be used during free-time and lunch periods, cell phones are a handy when you need to communicate with someone, and cell phones are really handy incase of an emergency.

This policy does state that cell phones are only to be used during lunch times and free periods.

Our lunch time is not during class time, meaning this policy does not interrupt teachers or distract us from our education. After all, cell phones are supposed to be turned off in class; so we can't use them to cheat, or be distracted by them.

Cell phones are really handy when you need them to contact someone.

Like if you leave something at home(like a project or a homework assignment), you can call a parent during free-time and tell them to bring it.

You can also like call someone if you need tutoring, or if you just need something from a friend, like notes or the homework from a certain class.

Cell phones are also handy during an emergency.

Like if something were to go down at the school(like a fire, a lockdown, or an earthquake), you'd be able to tell your parents that you're okay and nothing happened to you.

Also, like if you're feeling sick, you can call your parents during free time and tell your parents that you need them to pick you up.

Dear principal,

I believe that of the two policies being considered, it is clear that one is much better than the other. The first policy, stating that students can use their phones during free time and have them turned off during classes is a better choice than not having cell phones at all.

The cell phone is a main force behind a teenagers life. Cell phones being used at school is nothing new. Schools where cell phones have been banned show a lot of in class activity, by secretly texting behind their books or talking on the phone in the bathroom. If a cell on cell phones is put into effect, who is to stop kids from using them in class anyway, as they have in the past. The ban on cell phones would also make kids feel like they are less responsible than they truly are, by taking away their rightful possession's like a two year old. High school and middle school's job is to prepare you for the shark tank that is our world, and in the world, no one will be there to monitor your decisions, and whether or not it is the right time to use your phone.

And anyways, what's the point in having free time like lunch or recess, when you cant do what you truly want, which may be to text you friend or call your uncle? If there should be free time at all it should be open to the students to make their own decisions and use their phone if they feel fit.

Recently, a bus had broken down in Illinois. The bus, which had supposed to bring the students home between for and four thirty, had an engine blowout and did not arrive until over two and a half hours late. The students, due to the strict cell phone policy, had no means of calling their parents, and the furious parents wildly called the school, demanding to know where their children were. Since the bus driver did not have a cell phone either, the school was oblivious to the blowout and didn't have a clue either. if these children had their cell phones with them, that whole situation could have been avoided way easier and saved a lot of heartache for those parents.

If the phones are being turned off in class, they should definitely be allowed. Two or three people disobeying the rules is outweighed by the fact that cell phones are the kids rights and that they are very crucial in emergency situations as well as the happiness of the students attending the school. Students know that they have the power to do anything they want without getting caught and the other policy doesn't even cross the students kind, so why enforce it if it doesn't matter to the students anyway?

These things should be heavily taken into account and recognized by you and your staff. Thank you, and have a wonderful evening.

I honestly think cell phones should be aloud in schools during and extra time like if you have any family that live far away or and friends that live far away, you would want to get in touch with them or see what they have been up to. I have a cousin that in in the marines right now, but he broke is ankle in training so he is staying in California until it heals back up, and it is hard to talk to him, so the only time i really get to talk to him is on the computer on my cell phone, and on holidays and he says it is so amazing on how much i have changed over the years. I have a friend that lives in Colorado and we used to hang out all the time but ever since he moved we haven't talked that much, that is why i think cell phones should be aloud. You have a friend he/or she moves and you grow apart from one another. That's how you loose friends not being able to talk to them while you are in school. That is my statement on why i think phones should be aloud during school during extra time and between classes. My parents even think cell phones should be aloud during school, because they want to get in touch with us when they need to, to see what we are doing, ask us what we are going to do after school, tell them what time to pick us up all of this stuff is a reason or reasons for being able to use or cell phones during school. But i understand that some parents and school principles are taking them out of school class rooms or even the whole campus, one parent was talking to my parents about the cell phone policy and they said the reason i don't want cell phones to be aloud is because before i got my child a cell phone he was making straight A's in all of his classes but now he is making B's and

To me policy 2 is a better idea then policy 1. Kids shouldn't be allowed to use their phones at school because it can get them distracted. Having phones at school can make kids have lower grades because your taking away time for them to learn and become physical. With kids using their phones during lunch they might now be active, they'll just be sitting down texting or talking with their friends. Even if you tell them to turn their phones off during class it still will effect our learning experience. When kids have their phones on you don't know what they're doing. They might be bullying other kids or spreading rumors through texts. A lot of kids might disagree with my opinion, but its for us to have a better education. It's best talking to someone in person then having to text them and not be able to see what they want to say. If you let them have phones at school you could make them feel like they could do anything. If kids don't have phones at school at all we could all focus better and actually learn things. Education is the key to a successful career and it helps you have a wonderful life when your older. Cell phones should only be used for what they were made for which is for contacting other people, and not for games, rumors, or for sending text messages. Some people don't have phones too, so they may be forced to buy a phone because everyone has one. Plus it can effect their life at home to. With kids talking 24/7 on the phone their phone bill will keep increasing and it can make their parents go insane. When kids go to school they will think its another place where they can hang out. Many parents may disagree to this too. They don't want their kids to be doing mischief, they want their kids to have a great job when they are adults. That's the reason why they put them in school. Kids will probably be texting instead of studying, and when they take a test they will be under pressure. Overall I think we shouldn't have phones at school at all. It's best if we keep it the way it is now, because all the schools are doing very well and this is one of the rules that helps all the schools be successful. Having cell phones can effect grades and test scores, which we all care about. This is why I believe we shouldn't have school, others may disagree but this will help them have a better lifestyle.

I think that you should choose to allow students to bring their cell phones to school so we could use them during lunch and class passing times , as long as their off during classes . Because now the policy say's that we cant have our phone out at any time of the day unless its dismissal . And so when people get caught , we get in trouble and get a referral .

Which gets people suspended , And when your suspended you miss your work and can fall behind .Just because they got their phone taken away . Maybe it was their parent telling them something really important , or that a relative just past and their on there way to pick them up so get ready . Because they don't want to spend their time waiting for their kid to get their stuff when they could be saving time and get where they need to go .

Just because cell phones are important technology doesn't mean we have to bring them to school with us. I think that students shouldn't bring their cell phones to school at all because there would be too many distractions, students could use their phones to cheat, and students wouldn't get their work done.

""Ring, Ring, Ring!"" The annoying sound of a teenagers' cell phones going off during class. How wonderful is that? Can you image taking a test while your phone or someone else's phone goes off? Why should we allow cell phones in school if we will get a distraction every 5 minutes? Cell phones would cause too many distractions in school because students would be texting, playing games, playing their ring tones, and their phones would make insignificant sounds that go off every minute of the day. If students were to be playing with their phones wouldn't you get distracted?

Students could use their phones to go on the web during classes. This would allow students to cheat and as they get older and the new generation becomes the leaders of this country they'll realize that they don't know what to do because they cheated in school rather than paying attention and learning. Couldn't you see it now, this generation grows up and they need to take care of the country but they fail and aren't able to hold the country together because of the bad decisions of allowing phones in school? Mostly 96% of students that have a cell phone would use it to their advantage to cheat during a test, quiz, or an exam.

""Where's your work?"" Yeah, get use to this famous question because that's all the teachers will be asking. If students are allowed to use phones in school they well just be playing with their cell phones and not doing any other work. They will sit around all day just playing with their phones, and then school will just be called, ""Fun time."" I know that i sure don't like work but its better than sitting their doing nothing. ""Students wouldn't get their work done because they have something better in their hands. They won't even try anymore. Our country, United States Of America, would fall behind because of this major policy plan."" Says President, Obama.

In conclusion, students shouldn't bring their cell phones to school because there'd be too many distractions, students could use their phones to cheat, and they wouldn't get their work done. Let's go make sure this policy is known!

I think the you should follow the second phones at school because they can lose their phone.

some reasons are they can lose their phone at school. its a rule at any school and any thing can happen.

you should also follow the first policy because students may need to contact their parents or if they are in any after school programs like cheerleading, basketball etc.

There are many reasons why students should and should not have their phones in school, I think they should be able to bring their phones just turn them off because there so many reason why they need their phone.

Then again they shouldn't bring their phone because they might text during class taking up the time they need so they can learn. Many principal many get many complaints about their students having their phones in school I believe they cant do any thing about it, if one of their students phone goes off they shouldn't be able to take it but if it was out in plain view then they can take it but i think at the end of that class period they should be able to get it back but the teacher have to turn it off and let them know they cant turn it back on till the end of the day when they go home.

From point of view i believe that we should be able to have are phones in case of in emergency because we never know when somebody at school gets hurt o injured if they don't have any contacts on that student because they weren't allowed to bring phones to school its really falls down on that school.

Cell Phones in School

I think we should have cell phones at school because what if something would happen to you? You could have got hurt, need a ride home, or maybe going to a friends house. I agree that students should have cell phones at school during their free time. Like lunch, pe, but they should turn them off during class time. If you get caught texting or someone calling you during class they should just take it up until you pay for it. The cost should be $15 dollars. When you are working or taking a test, the teacher should take the phone up, then give it to you at the end of the class period.

Cell Phones Not in School

I also don't think we should have cell phones in school because what happens if someone is taking a test and the other person texting you tells you all the answers? Then you are in big trouble, not just from your teacher but also from your parents. Texting in school is bad because you get off track, don't pay attention to the teacher, or you may even cheat. School is where you learn not where you text people. Plus you can see all your friends in school, so why do you even need to text them during school. Just leave your phone at home and you can get it when you are going home. I understand if you are in sports and you have to stay after school or you have no ride home that day.

My Opinion

All I am trying to say is that just leave your phone in your backpack, turned off. Or just leave it at home. I think cell phones in school is a bad and good thing. But my opinion is just leave them off at home or in your backpack, turned off.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Cell phones allow us to talk to others from a distance, text each other messages, and used for pure entertainment. But are they really important enough to bring to school? Or do they cause more trouble than they are worth? Personally, I am siding with your second policy. cell phones should only be used for calls about transportation, whether you need to be picked up at a later time, bring a friend home, etc. But can't you use the school phone for that? Cell phones should be banned from school because they can get stolen, cause disruptions, and prevent learning.

First, cell phones are everything to teenagers these days. Some teenagers, however, may become jealous if one of their friends has a new shiny phone when their phone is all scratched up. Phones getting stolen is not an uncommon issue. Since the memory of a phone can be cleared, students are willing to get the next best thing, even if that means stealing it from a friend. Therefore, if students did not bring their phones to school, stealing is avoided and students can stay happy with the phones they have.

Next, when a student's phone rings, it causes quite a commotion. Disciplinary action is withheld and the student is left depressed and phoneless. However, the other students will be left laughing and the phone ringing is all they will discuss for the next few minutes rather than the day's lesson. Because this occurs daily with students, Policy 2 will make this disruption will no longer occur.

Lastly, students won't learn with cell phones at school because they are too tempting. I myself see students put there phone between there legs and text while the teacher isn't looking. Also when a phone goes off, all the students will be concentrated on is the ring rather than what the teacher is teaching.

Students should be allowed to have cell phones in school but to turn them off during class time. The policy is a great idea in a plethora of ways. Students stay out of trouble and not have to go through vigorous punishment. Also to have fun and still have the learning skill they need to succeed in life. Policy number one is the best choice for the school.

It is a very reasonable policy because students can have their phones and have their class time as well.

Instead of texting in class they can text in the hallway so it does not disturb the class room environment. That way the teacher's can teach the lesson and respect other students learning. If the policy is not put in place students will text in the class room when they have a slight chance of not getting caught unlike the hallways where there are teachers. The student would not be learning anything because they could not text outside of class. So when the students does get caught the teachers would have to stop the lesson and stop other students learning. Thus, texting outside of class helps students learn more and be more productive during classes.

Some students get in trouble because they have their cell phones. Students could be sent down to the principle's office to call parents about the situation. The problem is taking time out of the principle's plans as well as the students learning. This policy can prevent this situation from happening. If the student does not go down to the principle office their phones would be taken away instead. Making the student rebel and get sent out of class and get set home with out of school suspension for rude behavior. This circumstance can be prevented with the 1st policy. Making this rule will allow them to stay in school learning instead of being in the principle's office.

Without students having their cell phones there will be no learning in the class rooms. Students need time to text, it does not have to be in the class room it can be in the hallway at lunch. The students do not learn during those times anyway. Making this policy will benefit the students and the teachers. Without all of the mishap and the drama.

In my own prospective, I think that students should be allowed to use their phones in school and use them during their lunch period plus their free time. Option A is not only fair to the students but to the teachers as well. It gives students more freedom but there has to be some consequences.

If you automatically say that phones are allowed just not in class, us kids are obviously going to take advantage of that. We are going to use them whenever we can. In the hallways, when we take ""bathroom breaks"", skip classes, or hide their phone from their teacher and text during class. We are going to fight against it but there are ways that you can enforce the rules. In the hallways, phones should not be out during school hours. We would pay more attention to what we are texting rather then looking right ahead or paying attention to our surroundings. It can cause multiple accidents. I encourage for security to be around every edge of the halls and actually get kids to class by organizing the past so people won't be walking on top of each other. And in high school there should be no passes to students to go to the bathroom unless there really is an emergency. A lot of students would cut a part of class just to get to their phone. High school is not like Elementary school. Staff members can't be looking out for every single student in a school. But they could keep them from skipping classes. Security should be going around the hallways all the time to make sure any student isn't just roaming around in the halls. If there is, they should make them go to class unless they have a pass or a note to excuse them from the time being out of class. And the biggest issue of all is students texting during class. Even if teachers say to turn them off and hide them, we are still going to have them out when teachers are not paying attention. And that is an issue everywhere, no one really listens. There is a way teachers can stop it. It's impossible to have an eye on every student, that's why they should dispose of it right before class. There should be a bin where students put their phones. If any student has a phone during class and get caught, they should be the ones getting in trouble. Detention may be too much but just saying that there would be big consequences would really scare them.

I am not saying that doing this would make everything all good. Students these days really rebel against the teachers and the staff. They may not listen the first time but they will get used to the rules and at some point they might have a change of mind. This could make a big difference, make the school a better place, and a better learning environment for those who really care about their education. It could even get the rebels on the right track. Whatever you chose some will go along with, I'm just saying that a lot of kids won't want to go to your school if you don't let student have phones at all and they would really be against you.

E37DDD386B5B,"Dear principal,

I think both policies are a good idea. But i do find that one is better then the other because of many reasons and its not just because I'm a student I'm looking at it as many different point of views as if i was a parent, a teacher, and a student.

I honestly think that policy one is a good choice. I think it will keep kids from sneaking texts in school. I think this because if we get to use our phone during the free times we have which there is a few we would all use them then instead of texting in class because they know they can text without getting caught or paying a fee in the free times or lunch periods. The only problem you have to worry about is them starting drama through texting at school. I personally don't keep my phone in my pocket at school i keep it in my locker, and sometimes its on and sometimes its off.

I think if we went to policy two it would definitely keep us out of trouble and save us from distractions. But if we couldn't have our phone on school campus at all or not even in our backpacks then there would be issues with kids getting home, or parents aren't able to get a-hold of their kids because they don't have there phones with them after school, and they have to walk home. That could really start some problems/issues with the parents. But this is just my opinion.

personally think policy one is the better idea. I do believe it would keep the kids from sneaking around and trying to text in the class room. Yeah, there will be ups and downs with that policy one but there would be ups and downs with policy two too. I think it would be cool the have our phones out during free times too. But yet again I'm allowed to bring my phone to school, and i don't try to use it in class, so it wouldn't really matter to me i guess. Except trying to find my mom when she picks me up from school. but anyways this is just my opinion one the policies and how i see them as.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6
58621C689C7B,"I think you should use policy 1. allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I thing you should go with this policy because there is no need to take cell phones away. Because almost all people have cell phones and that will mean they cant use it. And I think they should at least be able to use them on there free time as long as they are no bothering anyone and they keep it on vibrate .

But I also belive that no one should use them during class because it will be a bother to every one and they wont be able to get there work done because someone would be sitting in class just texting on there phone. But if some don't bring phones to school at all then they wont be able to call there parents to pick them up or in case of a emergency. but the students should not be walking around the school talking on there phones just walking into people because there no paying any attention to what they are doing at all. and they should have there phones off during class to like I already said so no one is on there on there phone in the middle of class bothering people.

Using policy two is just going way to far because the only way that I would do that one is if all of the kids in the school get on there phones in the middle of class and just stay on it for the whole time without doing anything else without even paying attention to anyone or anything else. But policy one is more understanding because it is getting phones out of the way while they are working but not while they are on there free time because phones shouldn't bother anyone if its on there free spare time .

A0F1B1F7D109,"Dear principal,

I think that you should let students have there phones at lunch and free time as long as the phone is turned off in the classes. The reason for this is that they could use it only at lunch to talk to friends and to just see what has been happening or even to talk to there mom and dad. It might be a good idea because even if you make the policy no cell phones aloud in school they are going to bring them anyway and use them when the teacher isn't looking. I also think that cell phones could be useful in classes to, one reason for that is that the students could use the phones as a calculator or to look something up on the internet for a certain project where u have to use the internet but there is no more computers to use. The students could also use the cell phones to text the teacher an answer to a problem instead of wasting paper.

All i am saying is that you should give them a chance and if it don't work out you can go back to a no cell phone policy. These are my reasons that you should let the students use there cell phones in school. I hope you consider the policy I chose because it could be useful in so many ways but it could also be bad in many ways to . And if you do choose policy 1 that u wont regret it because the students might do better in school plus you wont have to keep taking phones away every day.

692DFB8C2898,"Cell phones should not be at use when in class. Sometimes a student will text under their desk or in the backpack trying to hide it when in class when they should not be. I think Policy 1 would clear that problem right up. The reason I have chosen this policy is because, like I had stated before students do not need there cell phones in class, but when they are at lunch the office can't send a pass for a student not to be found, because they are at lunch. If a student's parent were to bring a lunch for their child the student would not be able to receive it in time before their lunch time is over. So, students should be aloud to call or to text their parent's so they know when they can go to the office and receive their lunch.

Although students should not use there cell phones during any other free times in class only because who ever they are texting, maybe a friend, that other student may not be having free time in their class. So that student would be disrupting his/her class and disobeying their teacher. When a student is texting in class that means that they are not listening to what their teacher is teaching them. So if a test comes or a quiz the student will not know what to do because he/her was texting and not listening in class.

80DCC4992B10,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm going to be straight and to the point, our students should be able to use their phones during free time and lunch periods, I do first agree that it has become a big enough problem to do something about the cell phones, but doing a way with them is not good idea it was already a rule not to use them during class, but they use them anyway what would a policy saying to never bring your phones to school do, we don't have the man power or time, or even rights to search them and no doubt a majority will still bring them anyway and disrupt class and their own learning, but if give them two times within the day when no learning is taking place to text or talk on the phone this will give time the time they need to get their socializing out before schooling.

If we give them some freedom they will come back and give us what we want, and in that case it's a winning situation for everyone. I can say myself I would learn better if this was the new policy Now if students disregard this new rule then disciplinary action goes as follows 1st time caught using device outside of free zones then a warning is issued, 2nd time and you get detention, 3rd time you lose the privilege for 9 weeks and detention, 4th will be decided by you the principal. If you go with the policy i have brought up, you will become more popular with the students and gain more respect giving you more lead into new rules you apply. it's said that if you give students more freedom of choice the can pay attention more and stay awake and alert during class. When students are distracted by these things like texting, talking on the phone they become distracted, and use food as a source of getting out of conversation or of being bored, which means more money will be spent on food, which is more money for the school.

The only non benefits i can think of from this plan is that students might still use their phones in class but discipline could take care of those problems, so the plan is almost flawless.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6
149CECF2426C,"Dear Principal,

I believe that you should allow students to use their phones during lunch time, and other free periods. It is inevitable that students will have their phones with them at school. So if you give them the freedom they want and let them use their phones during school then they will accept your policy and strive to maintain it. You will have compromised with them and they will respect you for it. On the other hand, if you take away their phones and don't let students use them during school they will still us their telephones anyway. Humans, just like animals, have a natural instinct to rebel against authority. Especially teenagers because this is a time of self discovery for them, and they must first fight authority, before they can become it.

The free use of theirs phones, also gives students a sense of safety, and don't you want your students to always feel as safe as possible. When they have their phones they will feel that they are prepared for the worst. If something bad happens, they are ready at a moments notice to call for help. Why would you want your students to feel unsafe, when it would be so easy to just let them have their little pieces of plastic that we call phones? It seems to me that the only logical thing to do, to insure a sense of security throughout the school, would be to let students have their phones.

Cell phones can also be used as a helpful research tool. When your in the middle of study hall and you need to look up to find the number of electrons in an atom for example. All you would have to do is reach in your pocket and pull out your hand-held computer (cell phone). It is so much easier and simpler to use a phone to look something up then struggling to find a free computer for your use. Why would you want to put such an intentional strain on students? Especially since their lives are already so hectic. Wouldn't it be nice to ease their burden but doing something as simple as allowing them to use their phones?

When you compromise or strike a deal with teenagers, they will respect you and honor the deal. They react well with cause and effect situations because they are easy to understand and connect with. Personally I feel that since students will always have their phones no matter what an adult says, in an attempt to ensure a feeling of safety in the school, and because cell phones can be useful research tools, you should allow students to care their cell phones. However, I also agree that they should only be used during lunch and free periods. I'm sure that if you make this deal with the students and allow them their phones, they will react positively.

0FF781FB6050,"I think that our principal should let teenagers use their phones during school. During free time will be the best policy. I agree that cell phones need to be turned off during class because you will not get an education or succeed. Why should we have cell phones during free time and not during class? Students need to pay attention in class and not goof off. They wont succeed if they are to busy texting someone. Free time is the best time that students need to use their phone or at lunch.

Why I think people should use phones during lunch or free time is because someone in my math class texts one of their friends while my teacher is talking to the class. Since I am a middle school student that is a big deal! Phones are the best thing in technology right?

Free time or lunch is the best because the teachers are watching us when we eat and they wouldn't really care. During class is a whole different story. If the teachers saw one of their students text someone or using their phone in any sort of way they would give you ISS or Chill out. But if we use it during lunch while we are not being taught something it wouldn't really matter.

While teachers are teaching a lesson while writing on the board they rarely turn around unless someone is asking a question or letting the students write down the notes.

My math teacher is always telling someone to make sure they write down their notes. Most of the time while that person is texting someone, our teacher doesn't even notice! That is the part I don't get. Why wouldn't a teacher walk over or something to see why that person is not taking their notes? If I was a teacher I would go over to that person while the rest of the students that want to succeed in education are taking the notes and see why that person wouldn't be taking any notes. And if I noticed that person just put their phone or ipod into their pocket I would say let me see what you just placed in your pocket. If that person said I didn't have anything I would say I just saw that you put something in your pocket, you deserve Chill out. Think about this for a second if you were a teacher would you want your students to excel in education and go to college or use their phones during the class while your giving a lesson?

I don't agree with not having phones at school at all. Why? The reason is that if someone forgot about a meeting that they have to attend after school, they could go to the bathroom and call their parent or guardian to let them no that they will not be riding the bus or getting picked up.

66F4DE5B55E1,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe you should reconsider your cell phone policy, to cell phone policy number one. I believe you should choose cell phone policy number one, for numerous reasons. One reason is, kids wouldn't try as hard sneaking there phones out in class, and being worried about getting caught rather then paying attention to the actual lesson, that is being taught. Second reason, students would also want to come to school more often too, because they know they'll still be able to use there cell phones on school ground. Which at this age many students want to do or even tend to do, and suffer the punishment or not get caught at all. My last reason, students would be able to get out what they need to say to a fellow student before class, other then students passing notes, talking across the class room, or making excuses to leave the classroom to see another student. TEACHER_NAME, cell phone policy number one will benefit; the student, which it can make easier to stay out of trouble. The teachers, where they will not have to stop lessons to take up a phone. This will also benefit you as well, by you not having to take time out of your day to address the situation that should not come up. With that, TEACHER_NAME

I think that you should consider the first policy to allow students to use phones at school during free time. The reason is and fact that even if you don't allow students to use phones they will eventually use them anytime. To make it easier and allowing the students to use phones will allow them to feel like they have more freedom and obey the rules, well at least I hope. Also using them at their launch and free time will be more convenient and they will be able to finish whatever business they have before or after class without the pressure of being caught. I, personally, don't really use my cell phone much. The only reason why I have a cell phone is one for emergencies such as when an earthquake happens, tornadoes, unlikely, flood, injuries, to tell my parent where I am, or many when I'm abducted but alien, that could happen. Secondly is that I'm close to going to high school, and that all of my friends are going to a different school then I am and I really would like to keep in contact with them. Other then that really, i don't care about the phone policy at all, but you really should consider the first choice since it's about my vote, it's about the other students vote so hear from them and not me, because my phone is always turned off, and stuffed in the side of my backpack. I also think that the others would enjoy the privilege of using their somewhat treasured cell phones, and if they take advantage of this privilege then go with the second choice , because I'm not supporting anything that going to interfere with my learning environment.

Dear, Principal I believe you should go with policy one because you may never know what might happen and I think students at least deserve to have the phones out during lunch and free period. Students should be allowed to use the phones during these times because if not, emergencies may happen and we may not know until after school is over. For some students it is very important to make a phone call at least ones during free period or lunch. One of the other reasons why they should have there phones with them in school is, in these days like now you have a lot of school shootings happening or other dangerous stuff going on, that sometimes you have to call the police. Imagine knowing your mother is going to be delivering a child and she promised to you that she will call. Now Imagine no one home and your in school and your phone is taken away from you and your mom is the only one and she calls you because she had an accident and she needs someone to call help or you to come home. I also don't agree with policy two because things happen and in these kind of cases you need the phones with you no matter what. Children's safety is very important and they should carry a phone with them. Students can use there phones during free times, and lunch but after that they must immediately shut them off and get to class.

I have now heard that you are considering banning cell phones from our school!

I say that you should let us have our phones but just let us use them during our lunch periods. Many kids really do rely on their phones so they can get to school and back without any problems.

If there is a problem any where in the school the kids are able to contact help.

If you do allow phones but only if they are turned off in class, I think we would rather have that than no phones at all. Many kids will turn them on anyway but them you could just take them up. I will personally turn mine off during class but only if there is an emergency.

Another reason we should have phones is because of parents. Parents are the reason most kids have cell phones anyway. If the parent works far away, it's is nice for them to know if their kid got home safely. I know that my mom would always like to know where I am at all times.

Phones will be turned on in class but if some do, you don't need to punish everyone else for that. I think that only the good kids should be allowed to have their phones during lunch but off in class. Many kid try to sneak a text in when our teachers aren't looking and I feel that is really an issue. A lot of kids aren't even learning much whenever they are too busy texting during class.

I've been thinking about your policies towards the phone use during school hours. I thought about it and the second choice seems the best one to me. Like this the students will be more concentrated on their tasks, and will stop texting during class periods. On other words students will wait until lunch or like you said free time to use theirs phone This way you can evade confiscating students phone all the time. Also teachers would have more time to teach the class, and she/he wouldn't have to stop the class to take the phone away from the disobeying student. This policy would also help the school because students would pay more attention to what their learning and would get better grades. It can come in handy because the school and the principal would get a good reputation towards how they control the school and the students. Most students would like you more and probably look up to you in a possible future as a great idol.

I don't think that middle school students are responsible enough to use cell phones without abusing their privilege. Many students already use their phones during class time, and if the rule was to turn it off during class time i think many people will break it. Many people don't follow the rules so i don't think it is right to reward them for it. Many student would like to use their cell phones but i think it would be best if they were off during school.

But i also think its wrong that the policy is no cell phones in school at all because if their off during school i don't see how they could be a problem.

I hear that you are considering two different polices about using phones in school. Kids tend to use cell phone in class to text their friends and this disturbs the class from focusing on the teacher. I understand that you must take all this in to consideration, but I believe that policy one is the one you should go with. Students need to be able to uses phones in school in case they need to call a parent to pick them up after school , to call their parents in cases something happens at school, and in case they need to call a friend to tell them something quickly.

Student sometimes go to after school activities or stay after school to meet with their teacher. In this case, if their soccer practice ends early or their meeting is going to take some more time, students will need to contact a parent to tell them to pick them up earlier or later. If, though, phones are not allowed in school then they will not be able to tell their parents. This will lead to the student have to stay at school once practice ended or try and walk home.

School problems happen all the time. Sometimes their is a power outage or an early dismissal. If a student needs to contact a parent and they can't use their phone there is going to be a problem. If they could have cell phones, though, then the student could call their mom or dad, ask them to pick them up, and be able to leave the school quickly.

People sometime forget a book or a binder in their classes. When this happens they need to go around and try and find. Trying to find a textbook in a large school is hard. If your friend is in Math and finds your book, would it be a problem if they text you saying I found you book. This will take the stress off of the kid who lost the book. It will all be done before class, so it won't disturb anyone. But if phones aren't allowed in school kids couldn't do this. This can cause many stressful students who can't find their textbook.

Furthermore, cell phones can be very useful when used the right way. If student chooses to use them correctly, then the first policy would work very well for this school. Kids can get home quicker, get out of the school if something happens, and find their books faster. It will benefit not only us students but also our parents.

I know that you are a little conflicted on the decision of banning cell phones from school, or not. I am writing to tell you my opinion on cell phones. Maybe it will help you make a decision, and also see the situation from my point of view.

I believe that cell phones should be aloud in school and for multiple reasons. One reason they should be aloud is because people need their cell phones. I am not talking about the fact that we must have our cell phones or we would 'die', but the fact that we need them for emergencies. If we didn't have our cell phones, how will we know if family emergencies occur. Or even if our parents are not home so we have to stay at another house. We may also need our phones for 911 emergencies, and even to call home to say that your going to be late. Our phone is our life line of sorts. We need them for way more reasons than texting, listening to music, or making 'petty little phone calls' as you say.

So in conclusion, I think that you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during their free time. As long as they have their phone turned off in class. It's giving them free rein, but with limits.

Have you ever wondered what would happen if there was a fire or a tragedy during school? If one was to happen wouldn't you want students to be able to call for help? If you put policy one in our school you would never have to worry about hat again. In fact, if you bring policy one into our school you would have students would pay more attention in class, students being able to call their parents if something was wrong, and if a student forgot something they could call someone.

When students are in school it is totally different than being at home. When we are at home we text our friends and are always on our phones, but when we come to school we have to turn our phones off and not use them. Students are always tempted to text during class so if you let us text during lunch it relives that temptation. Policy one would help us so that is why it is a good idea.

If there was a tragedy during school and a student was hurt and you couldn't hear them what would help them? A cell phone because they could call for help to save them. If a student did not have the cell phone then they may have no way to call for help. I think policy one would help you so that no one would get hurt.

If you are in class about to go to a different class and remember that you forgot something at home that you needed you could call a parent during lunch to get them to bring it and not get a bad grade. If you have policy one that would happen. I think that if you had policy two then you would have worse grades and have a higher drop out rate. You do not want that, do you?

All in all, i think that it would be beneficial to you if you had policy one not two. you should seriously consider using policy one. Policy one is thee better choice and it would be better for students.

I think that you should do policy one (allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned of during class time.) One reason is because what if something happened to one of our family members and they don't have the school numbers so they need to get a hold of us and we don't have our phones on us. Second reason is we have after school activities that we attend on a daily bases or just a few times a week but we wont be able to reach our parents to come pick us up after it is done because the office is always closed after that at that time so we can not use the office phone. Third reason is it might help kids come to school because most the kids get bored at school and need something to do so if you made it so they were able to have there phones on free time they would say man if I go to school I can get my work done and then I have free time to use my phone then there would be no question why kids aren't coming to school and that person will keep there grades up better.

But if you make it so they can't have them then people are still going to bring them and parents won't be able to get a hold of there kids. There would be a bunch of confusion in parents not knowing when to come and get there kid from school then parents wouldn't let there kids do after school activities and then the school would not make a profit for extra things they need to make our school better. Therefore you should use policy one because it just make the school a better place for students and more fun and just eliminates all the confusion between parents and children.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

The policy I believe is better for our school will be policy 1. Policy 1 allows students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Being able to have this policy will be great incase of an emergency. If phones are not allowed and there is an emergency during lunch periods or other free time the student will have a hard time to try communicating his or her mother or father.

Having the policy will give a chance for students to use there phones only during lunch periods or other free time that way students won't be trying to use them during class, because it will distracted them from doing their class work.

Another reason may be students at our school will have the time to look over their messages or calls they get from their parents or another family member. This policy allows lunch periods or other free periods only. Teachers will have the rights to take phones away if seen during a class period , because the student already had the chance to use their phones in their own time. The students can only have their phones in vibration during the free time. When walking in class the phone has to be turned off, after the class time is over and it's another free period the phones can be put in vibration. This policy will help a student for any emergency with family.

The school and you as the principal should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free periods only.

Cell phones at school are constantly being debated.

Everyone has different opinions about what should be done.

We all know that cell phones can be distracting, but what if we allow students to have their cell phones at school and use them during lunch?

I think that's a great idea.

Students should be allowed to use their cell phones during school as long as they aren't using them in class.

There would be no harm in allowing the students to use their cell phones while they aren't in class.

If a student is using a cell phone while they aren't in class, why should they be punished for just calling a friend?

It's not like they are getting distracted from their schoolwork because they are using their phone outside of class.

However, students should only be able to use their phone while they are outside of class.

If they are caught using their phone in class when they know full well that they shouldn't be using it, they should be punished.

However, a student should be able to do whatever he wants with his cell phone outside of class because he or she isn't distracting anyone.

Students just like to talk to their friends and they shouldn't be punished for wanting to do that.

Teenagers constantly have something they want to say to other people.

Sometimes, they just have to let their best friend know about what is happening in their life.

It would be wrong to not allow a student this opportunity especially if their not in class.

There is very little freedom to do what you want in school these days.

This is why schools need to allow cell phone use outside of class.

As I stated before, there is no harm in calling a friend while you're outside of class.

Finally, sometimes kids just like to break the rules.

They want to talk on their phones in class just so they can appear cool to their friends.

If the students are allowed to talk outside of class, they won't be driven to talk to their friends inside of class.

This is because they aren't breaking the rules anymore.

They don't seem as cool.

If students are allowed to use their phones outside of class, there won't as much cell phone distraction in class.

Students should definitely be allowed to use their cell phones outside of class.

They really want to use their phones and there is no harm in letting them do so.

It will also limit the amount of distraction in class brought on by cell phone use.

There is nothing wrong with allowing students the privilege of talking on the phone outside of class.

I would like to say that I support the option to use cell phones during free time throughout the school day. Students need a way to communicate with out making too much noise. Using cell phones between class allows students to communicate with their friends even if they are across the school. It also allows them to contact their family if it is necessary.

Using there phones between classes will also help keep students happy and the happier the student is the more likely they are to focus. Even if students were not allowed to bring cell phones to school, they would anyway and then they would use them in class. This just cause more students to get in trouble then necessary. If you do make the rule that students cannot bring cell phones at least consider keeping record of how may times each student has been caught with their cell phone and make it a set number of times they can be caught with it until they are severely punished( at least once).

I hope that you will take my thoughts on the matter under concern, and if you do ban cell phones I understand.

Although at first, it may seem as if a little leniency with the phone policy will help, it won't. personally, I believe in option number two, where there are no cell phones what so ever. With that small amount of responsibility given to the students, many kids they will still be able to go out of control with it.

First and foremost, is that with given the option to have phones during free time we will see a great increase in phone usage in the classroom. It could be for many reasons, including, having not finished their conversation, ""forgot"" to turn them off, have something ""important"" that they have to address, or a whole mess of other things. Many kids will just keep their phones on and use them during class furthering their distraction in class. I'm sorry to say this, but we, at our age just can't be trusted to uphold a thing such as that, I know of many people who even now, without any free time with phones, use them regularly in class, and that is with a strict policy.

Secondly is the limited control on cell phones. We have no idea what may be sitting on any kids phone at any time. If allowed, there will be so many phones that proper monitoring will be impossible! I know from experience that there can and is some seriously nasty stuff on just about every persons phone in this school. Technology just hasn't advanced enough to keep a watch out for such things on something like a cell phone. There is no plausible way that we could stem the profanity that would enter our school.

Lastly, and definitely not the least, is the amount of bullying that can happen with bullying, you think rumors spread quickly now. Oh boy, are you in for a surprise when phones get introduced into the picture. Things can be spread in an instant to every person at any second. Lives will be ruined. and friendships broken, just because of a little 6 inch piece of plastic. I believe that is by far the worst harm that can come from phones. being put down in front of your

I know it may sound like I'm being harsh, but it is fair. People at this age just can't be trusted all together with such open devices. You of all people should know, since I'm sure you've had many cases of this, that we can't have such things to distract us from the one thing that upholds our future.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing to you in behalf of our student body, about our school cell phone policy. As you know many of us students know and follow the policy while others do not. We all know that we are not suppose to text in school at all. We know the consequences and all that good stuff. But I am writing to you about changing that policy just a little.

Do you think it would hurt to let us students use are cell phones during our free time at school. Yes we know school is for learning but there are apps on a cell phone that you can use. You can use the calculator for math or science you can record what your teacher is saying for notes and many other things. So would it really hurt to let us use cell phones in school just a little.

Would you rather have a noisy lunch period or a quite one. If we could text during lunch imagine how much quieter it would be. Instead of yelling across the cafeteria to our friends we could just text what we want to say. It would make us happy and the teacher associates happy.

As you know kids are going to do what they are not suppose to do. So of course we are going to text during school because we don't like people controlling us. So if you made it so we could use our phones during school we wouldn't be breaking rules and to tell you the truth not that many kids would text. We just like to act out, you were a kid once don't you remember doing this.

Cell phones are a part of a teenagers life now.

It is how we communicate, keep up the gossip and stop rumors. Many teens sort out there problems by texting their peers to figure it out, I am one of them. Us teens can show you how to get caught up with the world if you could just bend the rule a little.

The teens now a days text twenty-four seven so why not just let them. We know the rules and we do it anyway so just let up a little. We could change the school. Just change the policy to letting us text during lunch and free periods. It would make us feel better and you could trust us more. It is embarrassing to have your cell phone go off in class. Some times we just forget about it because we always have it.

Thank you for listening and reading my letter. I hope it makes a change. We just want use our cell phones during lunch and free periods. That is not to much to ask, is it?

Policy 1, giving rights to students to use their phones during their free time, is a better choice to choose since it makes the students more comfortable, make them feel more open-minded in school, and it can even help students in their education by having a source to help them with assignments

First, it will be more comfortable for the students. Most schools are big, which is why some students lose their ways during first week of school. If you wanted to meet a friend during a free time or at lunch and you can't find them, what's a better way to find them than calling or texting them? Also, if you don't know where a new class is located, why struggle finding your way when you can text and ask your friend?

Secondly, students will feel more open-minded than before. If you ask an average student, whether they like going to school, most of them, honestly, will say no. Now we can't change that answer since school's purpose is to educate the students and the students tend to not like it. However, we can improve the image of the school for the students. If we open the rights to use cell phones during their free time, they will feel way more open-minded than before. This is important because if a student hates going to school and has a closed-mind about it, it will give tons of stress to that student and may effect his/hers educational career.

Thirdly, a portable source for the students. Nowadays, most students have some kind of smart phones or maybe just a regular cell phone that has a connection to a web or dictionary. Now imagine you were doing your homework during your free time and you don't know what a word means. Usually, if the right of using a cell phone was not opened, you would have to go to the library and check the dictionary. Now let's say that you had to research a certain topic. You would have to go to a computer in the library or someplace to do that. However, what if the all the computers were used by others. You would have to wait for a while to go on the web. If all these examples were changed to having the right to use the cell phones, you wouldn't have to worry about wasting time because you can do all of these at that exact moment and spot.

By reading all of these reasons, I hope you'll choose the policy that's the better for the students.

I would urge you on the matter of cell phone policies in a scholastic setting to approve policy 1. I believe policy 1 is the better choice because it is a compromise between teacher and student. Compromise is the best way to handle most situations.

Allowing students to bring there phones to school, but limiting there use to lunch periods and other free times while turning them off during class is a great compromise. All though technology is one of the biggest distractions to kids and teens today this compromise gives students better respect for class time as the teachers respect there social time.

Some may say social time comes after school and phones should not be allowed, but the majority of students would rebel anyways. Compromise is like being hungry once you 're full the temptation of eating isn't there anymore.

I think that students should not be able to use or have phones present during the school day. It is something that kids shouldn't worry about during the school day. phones should only be used in schools in the event of an emergency. Cell phones may cause problems in times that the student is working and will prevent he or she from completing their work.

Their is always the argument that cell phones may help students get rid of stress by talking to someone when no others can hear. That they could talk to friends that across the school or to another school. This could a chance for them to hang out with a friend that they cant see during the school day.

This could also have many down sides. This could lead to a increased risk of having cell phones away for saying stuff that is not needed or allowed to be said in school. This would increase the risk of student getting ISS, OSS, or even kicked out of school for not needed behavior. It could also lead to fights. Even cell phone theft or misplacement of a cell phone.

I hope that you will take what I have said into consideration. The school will stay a more friendly place to be. Their will be no unnecessary disruptions. The kids will be better off with no cell phones allowed to be used in the school building.

I have recently read the school's cell phone policy. I believe that policy number two is the best choice. Students shouldn't have cell phones in school at all because it can take their minds of their school work. For example, if someone sends a text to a student, it can distract that student and take their mind off their school work.

Students need to stay focused during school at all times. This is very important because students today need to be prepared for high school, college, and their future. Cell phones would distract students from striving for outstanding grades.

Today, you see the majority of students on their cell phones all day, usually texting. This habit can make students lack from doing their work in school. Students grades can easily drop and their only explanation for these poor grades is that they focused on their cell phones more than their education.

Being on cell phones all day can lead a student to a lot of stress. If a student does after school activities and sports, they still need to focus on school. Many students today are very busy with after school activities with their friends. Since the students do activities with their friends, they tend to text each other, and then that is all they are focused on. The students then don't care any more about their school work because they choose to focus on their cell phones.

I hope you understand my reasons why I believe that students shouldn't have phones on school at all. Students should really care about their education and focus in school . Education in the world really matters and is so important for students' future. Cell phones are not going to help a student have a successful future.

41B8C0A3D56B,Policy 1 is better for many reasons. One reason is if a student needs to stay after for a teacher then they can call their parent during lunch and tell them and the parent won't be worried about their child after school. Also if someone needs something at home for a class after lunch they can call there parent at lunch and ask to bring it buy and they wouldn't get a bad grade. The students could call their friends that weren't at school and talk to them and tell them what was happening in class. Also if a person couldn't get there stuff in school at the right time they might be able to call home and ask to bring it to school. A student might want someone to go over their house then they could call at lunch and ask. It helps stop so many kids from asking to call on the office phones.

Cell phones have been an issue in the schools. Policy one is the best suited for middle school students because if cell phones are forbidden complete the student will more likely want to break the rule. Giving the student liberty with limits is a good way to discipline the students into better people. Policy two is risking too much chaos within the school

Policy two is not the best choice for teenagers. Teenagers are in a stage where they want to know how far they can go before someone will put a definite stop. If the school decides to solve the cell phone problem by not allowing cell phones then they have ensured that the students will continue to bring cell phones; however, now more will bring phones just to test how much they can get away with doing.

Policy one is the best solution because the school is giving the students what they want but with certain limits. Teenagers would respond to this policy better because they know that they can bring the phones so they won't try to test the rules as much. The school should consider using the first policy because it would provide the students with the sense of liberty but with limits. This is something the school should consider teaching because the students need to know what a real life computerisation situation is like because in life everything doesn't always go your way and students should know that before they get accustomed to everything going their way.

Policy one will mold the student's way of thinking so they can begin to understand that everything has it's pros and cons. The first policy teaches the students that there are times that one must give up to obtain. In this case the students are giving up their phone usage during class but are receiving the right to used their phones in their free time within school hours. The cons in this situation was the troubles the students got into when they were caught breaking the rules.

I heard that you were considering two different policies about cell phones on campus.

Many students are going to be happy that you are considering to change the current rule about cell phones, but I think that the second policy is the way to go.

No cell phones of campus is the best for many reasons.

First, they are extremely distracting because if we are aloud to have them, that is all we will be worrying about.

I know, personally, that my cell phone can make me a different person.

Texting can be addicting, as most teenagers will tell you, but if you allow us to have phones on campus, we are likely to be on it all the time.

Some will say, ""I can get away with it"" or ""the teacher won't even know.""

Nine times out of ten, if we have them at one point of the day, they are likely to stay with us and not be put away when they are supposed to be.

Second, many teenagers can be bullied over the phone.

One kid will act like he is someone to else to trick another, and that will turn out to be bad because that person was not who they said they were.

Another reason is that if there are two people who don't like each other, and one of them gets a-hold of the other's number, they can say extremely mean things.

Finally, cell phones are to much of a distraction for us to be aloud to have them on campus.

90D83C644ECF,"Dear Principal, I think that policy number one is better for students.

I think this because, some students need cell phones to communicate to others such as parents or guardians.

They would use them incase of emergencies. I also think that the students would appreciate that rule better because, they want to have their cell phones with them at all times and if you take that privilege away, then they might get really mad and start disobeying the rule anyway. it's pointless. It would also help parents as well. It would help the parents because some parents might not know the school's number and call their child instead. If the student did not have his/ her phone with them because of a rule, then the parent would not be able to reach anyone.

Another reason why I think that policy number one is better is, because the students would learn more because they know that they are allowed to use their phone on their own free time and lunch. The students would have no reason to not pay attention in class. Therefore, they will most likely get better grades and probably pass their classes. The school will also be a happier environment.

On the other hand, this can lead to one thing. Bullying. Allowing students to use their phones on their free time can lead up to cyber bullying.

When other students hear a rumor about someone doing something, they would want to text it to their friends right away. When one person finds out, and they know its about them, then they could get really hurt. Also, others can send text messages to others talking about someone, and when the victim goes to talk to the person who received the text, that person might not want to talk to them because of ""what they did"".

Other than the bullying, I still think that policy one is the best choice for our school. It helps others communicate. It helps make friends, and it gives the school a better look to it.

D6DE836BDF1E,"Dear Principal,

Regarding the cell phone policy at school, I think you should use the first policy. I think the first policy, ""allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time,"" would be an excellent choice because students might need their phones for emergencies at some point in the day and it would be good to be able to call their parent or guardian if they needed something prominent.

For example, say a girl student named RELATIVE_NAME

were to forget her P.E. clothes at the beginning of the week and she wanted to get a good grade. She could call her parent or guardian and ask them to bring her clothes for P.E. She would then get a great grade for participating and being prepared. Now say if she didn't have her clothes, she wouldn't have been able to participate because she wasn't prepared, and would then get a zero for a grade.

Another reason why this policy would be best is most students are bound to have their phones on them anyway so it wouldn't hurt much. The only problem with picking the first policy is that because the students know they are allowed to have their phones on them, powered off, however, is a different story. Knowing they're allowed to have their phones will increase the chance of them texting in class, when they're not supposed to because they have it with them and they will be tempted to use it to text their friend sitting right next to them. The only way to ever stop this is almost impossible. Which is why choosing this policy won't hurt much. Students will always be tempted to text in class so it won't really matter whether or not they're allowed to have their phone with them.

Once again, the policy I believe you should choose is Policy #1. You should choose this policy because students may need something for school or their might be an emergency so they can call their parent or guardian. Also, students are and will already be tempted to text during class because in most cases, they have their phones on them anyway so it will not change much except give the students a chance to call their parent or guardian for an emergency. That is why you should choose Policy #1.

I think that policy one is a great idea. Having cell phones will make school great for students. We the students should have a great time at school but learn at the same time so i do think we can have phones at lunch and free time, because during class we need our learning time sure but not during class we can have our own time. Having cell phones will make it fun but only during those to times. When we our done with our phone we will make sure that we turn it off, and if somebody cell phone is not off they have the right to get it taken by a teacher or principal .

Cell phones will make school exciting for students, we can learn and have fun at the same time. I honestly think that you can trust us with this idea, we will not let you down. If you give us this chance to have the right to have our cell phone out at anytime besides learning period than that will be great. We need learning and we also need fun so please give us a chance with this decision. Thank you for giving us this opportunity to try something new and i hope we can get the decision we are looking for.

With us having our phones during free time that mean we can come back to learning time prepared just cause we had some time to ourselves. When it come to cell phones us the students are up for anything and we would love this opportunity to have cell phones out but not during learning time.

I think that policy one is a better option because that way students can use their phone if they need to. Limiting cell phone use to their lunch period and free time is a wise choice because then their is no way they can get distracted in school with the feeling of wanting to check their phone all the time because they will have the option to do so.

At my school we don't have the option to use our phones. We can bring them to school but the rule is that they have to be off and in our lockers the whole day. Now what really happens is that kids will keep their phones in their pocket and whenever they feel bored in class they will pull them out and start using them. I see all kinds of texting in my class that teachers don't know about because kids know how to hide them. If you give them the option to use their phones at appropriate times I think it will limit texting in class.

Another reason you should allow kids to use their phone during free time and lunch is because in class the teacher may ask a question but never get around to answering it. The kid can then use his or her phone to google the question and come up with an answer. I know in my classes the teacher can be talking and ask a question but never get around to answering it. It bugs me so bad! But since we aren't allowed to use our phones in school we have to wait until we get home or on the bus. Well by that time most of us have already forgotten the question. So we never know the answer.

One final reason is suppose a kid gets sick. Most kids don't like to go to the nurse's office. I know I don't. So if the kid can wait until lunch or his free time he can then call his parents to come get him so he doesn't have to stay at school sick. At my school if you get sick and you don't want to go to the nurse you are stuck at school. No matter how bad you feel. You can ask the teachers if you can call your mom but they always ask why. If you tell them your sick they make you go to the nurse. If you go to the nurse unless you have a fever, no matter how bad you feel, they make you stay in school. But what are you going to learn if your sick? Nothing! You can also get other kids sick that way. So if you let your kids use their phones, school might be a little easier to handle.

You might want to consider letting them use their phones. It might end up helping your school! But of course the downside is what if they forget to turn off their phones? Well I guess you will still have to have some rule about taking their phones away. I hope these ideas will help you make a decision on allowing your kids to use cell phones in school.

My name is STUDENT_NAME

to my opinion i think that policy number 1 is the best choice that you could have chosen because to begin with most kids don't even use their phones at school, next this could be a reward for those hard working kids, lastly even if you take the privilege of having phones at school the students will still bring the phone behind your back.

First of all, most of the kids use their phones at school. Research says that about 75% kids have good grades. this shows that most kids don't really find an usage to having a phone. In my personal experience, having a phone is not going to help me find an answer to a problem at school. Cell phones are for having fun, it would be wrong for you to take our phones away.

Second of all, it would be a reward for those kids that have to work hard just so they can keep their phones. Most parents make a deal with their kids saying that is they get good grades they can keep their phones. so it really is a reward to those kids having time to use their phones at free time.

Lastly, even though you take our phones away we will still use them. most kids do that now because they don't have the freedom to use their phones. It would make me heartbroken to see you take away a privilege that we have. Our phones are our only way to communicate with the world.

In conclusion i think that you should go with policy number 1 because it would be fun to see your students happy all the time rather than have them with a bad attitude. no principal wants to see their students sad. So maybe next time you reconsider any of your rules or policies you may want to think about your students and how your choices might have an impact on their lives.

07CC30055043,"It is true that cell phones are distracting during class time but they have become necessary in today's society. This technology has become part of our daily lives and much more than a telephone. Cell phones have now evolved into hand held computers that we carry with us every were we go, even school. This could be the next step into a more advanced future in our current educational society.

I am not claiming that we should be aloud cell phones during class periods as well because I am aware of the difficulties that could come with that. Although during the students free time they should be aloud any technology that is offered to them, otherwise if their are so many restrictions I am confused on why they call it free time. With their cell phones students are also able to email and work on certain papers or projects therefore helping them with school.

Students should still have their phones turned of f during class periods because they do cause a distraction no matter how helpful they may be. Even if this is a problem today with the current rules stating the no cell phone policy's. With students able to with students able to use cell pone out of class they may be less tempted to use them within the class period.

Therefore I feel it is in the schools best interest to allow cell phones during student free time.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

It wouldn't matter if they could use it during snack or lunch because they are already with their friends during their free times. Letting them use it during snack and lunch will tempt the kids to use it during their periods. The cell phones will distract themselves and their class mates.

When a student uses their phone during class, they are not paying attention to the teacher but only to the text message and will only get half or less of the entire lesson. They would not understand the lesson or might not even remember what the teacher just said. Their grades will drop and the students around him or her will get distracted and might not pay attention to the teacher either. If phones were allowed at school, it might make more trouble then without it. If a student sees their classmate or student next to them use their cell phones during class, that student too will try or at least think about using their phones during class. If this happens too many phones will be taken to the office.

If students were allowed to use their phones during snack or lunch, they would not use it as much because they are already with their friends and their won't be a need to use their phones. If they might not use it during their free time, why allow it at all. Letting the kids use their phones during snack and lunch might tempt the kids to be using their phones during class even more then not allowing them to use their phones at school at all. Changing the rules to make kids use their phones during snack and lunch won't help the kids but make them distracted even more. Problems with phones might happen more often then normal and the parents might not like the idea of letting their kids use their phones during school hours. I think the parents will complain which will make a lot of arguments happen.

I believe that students should not be able to use their phones during school. If students were allowed to have their phones, it will make to much trouble between the teachers and the students.

It would help them if they needed to contact a parent. It would give them a chance to text a friend so they would not do it in class. It would allow them to be more focused if they did not have to worry about texting. If they could get their texting done at school they might not go to sleep in class.

If they did their texting during their free time they would not go to sleep during class. They would work hard to get their free time so their grades would get better. If the teachers allowed them to text they would have fun in class and listen to the teachers and be more friendly to them. If the whole country did this there would be an increase in the good grades all over the country

I believe that if we did this the students would be happy and their grades would be better and they would go on to college. It would be a smart choice for the school to allow them to text during free time. If they could text in school they would have more time at home to study or read or do home work. And if a student was caught texting in class the phone should be taken up and the parent of the child should have to come get it.

I think the principle should not allow students to have phones at school at all. I think that is a better decision then allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. I think that because that may affect the students learning and education. For an example a students was texting another student of something that happened in a different school.

Then she told her what happened, but she didn't tell her everything because the student has to go to class now.

Today was a really important lesson, but the student didn't pay attention at all because she wanted to know what happened next and she was wandering and dreaming.

She didn't pay attention at all and when she took a test the test had some questions that had to do with that lesson, but guess what she failed. The other student was in class when she was texting. She didn't pay attention because she was busy texting and also that affected the other students learning and education and she also failed the test because they also had a really important lesson that they needed to know. That's why its really important to not allow students to bring phones in school at all.

Also if the student bring phones to school that also might disturb other students. For an example when you bring your phone to class and you forgot to turn it off then it rings all the sudden. That might disturbed the whole class and also might affect the other students learning. I also think they should put that as a school rule in all schools that ""Phone's are not Allowed to be in School"".

Never ever bring your phone to school at all. I think that would be the best policy for all schools.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Dear Principal,

Our world has evolved and changed, and with it has come a new era of technology. Almost every student has a phone, but i believe that if you enforce Policy 2, you will only make using cell phones during school an even more tempting, which will create an unhealthy learning environment.

If we have less harsh guidelines on this school's cell phone policy, like allowing the use of phones at lunches and free time, then when actually in class, students will actively participate in teacher's lessons instead of sneaking a peek at their phones. Obviously in the past, it has been hard

In addition, it is a hassle for staff to enforce these strict rules, and by the end of the day students are zoning out all of the information that you want us to take in. The role of enforcer, rather than educator, may injure the teachers' ability to teach students who are eager to learn and understand new things. They dedicate their careers to helping us learn, so if phones are left unused during classes, but allowed during free time, teachers will be more helpful and a better instructor of their subject.

Also, there is the chance that something will go wrong. A student could be hurt on campus, and the availability of phones would make it so that help could be notified as soon as possible. In emergencies, phones are one of the greatest tools that we posses to ensure that any problems can be solved as quickly and efficiently as possible.

While most adults believe teenagers are obsessed with technology, our phones especially, we are not. But technology makes it easier to feel connected with the world outside of this school. Phones create an easier way to connect with our families and friends. Not to mention, that if a student needs help with school work or other problems, they can contact someone who could help them, so that they absorb what this school teaches better.

We must usher in this time in our country, and work with it to make a policy that will create a happier student body. If you implement Policy 1, than i can assure you that grades will go up, disturbances will stop, and you will be the principal of one of the finest schools in America.

B538ED9EE68B,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion, I like Policy 1 about the cell phone conflict.

Policy 1 states, ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time."" Why do I believe this policy is better? Here are my reasons:

Students may have an emergency and may need to contact their parent or guardian. It may be about something they forgot at home, cancelled club meetings and sports practices/games, or asking a question about something. Parents may also need to contact their son or daughter about any type of emergency, or letting the student know something. If students are allowed to use their phones during lunch and free times, they are easily able to contact their parents or guardian, or vice versa.

If students are given the privilege of being able to use their cell phones during lunch and free time, they will most likely be texting other students, whether that student is in the school or not. A lot of the time it may keep the students quiet and busy. If the students are responsible and don't fool around, they should be given the chance to use their cell phones.

Also, since students will most likely carry their cell phones around if they are given the privilege to use them during appropriate times, if there is an emergency at school such as a school fire, they can easily text message and/or call their parent or guardian to let them know exactly what is going on in the situation and to let them know that they are okay and safe.

If students abuse the privilege, such as doing inappropriate things with their cell phone, their text messages have been reported, or they have used them during class when they are not supposed to, teachers should be allowed to take the student's phone away and possibly give them other consequences for their action.

If students break or lose their phone, it is their fault and their responsibility, and the school should not have to take the blame for it. That wouldn't be fair, seeing that it is the student's property.

I believe that as long as students are using their cell phones appropriately, following the rules, and accepting the consequences if they abuse the privilege, they should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and their free time. Cell phones really come in handy nowadays, especially when contact is need to be made between two people right away. I believe that Policy 1 is the way to go. At least give it a try.

I think you should allow us the students to bring our phones to school and use them during lunch and free time as long as there turned off during class periods.

We are very responsible.

Lunch is a free time so we should be able to do what we want at that time. Also we will listen to all rules for cellular phone because we are responsible young adults.

Lunch is a time for us to socialize with friends. that's a time when we talk to friends and goof around. we should be able to have them cause that's our free time and we should be able to text and talk during that time. At that point and time nobody is worried bout work were talk to friends and telling bout how good our day is so far.

All rules you demand swill be followed like beside lunch and free times phones are not to be seen or there will be consequences of your choice. we are very responsible with putting them up at the appropriate time. We understand we have to learn at some point during the day and during that time we know okay its time t learn all cell phone put away!

We are very responsible young adult as long as you tell us the rules. they will be followed. This is something very good for us. there isn't anyway a phone could distract us from learning if there put away during ""the teachers time"". Nothing should go wrong to the point where you take the privilege away. We will take putting up our phone as a very valid responsibility.

We really want this opportunity to show you 1. we are responsible and 2. we can handle anything you throw at us. We are going to have no problems with i promise there will be phone away during class. you will only see them in the hall, during free time, and also lunch. We want to show you we can be big girls and boys but still learn in the same matter as we should. So on behalf or the entire school body i am asking you may you please allow us to bring phones to school and let us use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as we turn them off during academic classes. :)",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Dear Principal,

I believe that the idea of allowing Students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods, and free times as long as the phones are off during class time is a great idea. Many Students Today get in trouble for using their phone so by making it an option to use outside of class time may limit the amount of students getting into trouble. Common consequences for cell phone usage In modern day schools, are Warnings, confiscation of the device, and lastly confiscation and a parent or legal guardian must get it back for you.

By using this new cell phone policy, Parents and students could be relieved from stress.

There will always be those students who are going to text anyways no matter what during Lunch/Recess. Therefore Policy #2 wouldn't be such a great idea. Students who get their phone taken in school by an administrator or teacher, may react in anger or aggression, leading to a bigger problem like talking back to a teacher, or starting a fight out of anger. which would of course have bigger consequences, In Conclusion Policy #1 is better because it has a good effect on both students and teachers.

I hope you look into my thoughts and opinions, For the benefit of our school.

I have notice that you are trying to change the cell phone policy in school and I'm here to tell you that I think you should change it to your policy choice of number 1. With that being said I will give some reasons why I think you should change it to your policy choice number 1.

First off, the first reason why i think you should change it is that if you let the students have usage of their cell phone it will probably result to have the student respect the policy of not using it in class. Then when in class they will probably respect and turn off the cell phone.

Also, why you should change it is that what if they have a emergency and have to call home or need to call their parents. Some people don't like to use the office phone because maybe they need to talk about something private, they will not their information out for everyone to hear.

Last, maybe the students will feel more free and enjoy their transition time instead of rushing to get to class. And maybe they will enjoy the freedom of using their cell phones. Also they might enjoy coming to school.

All in All, I think you should change your cell phone policy to your policy choice of number 1. Trust me you wont regret it if you change it to policy number 1. You will get a lot of positive feedback for the students.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Their could be a fire and your phone could get melted if you didn't have it. Then how are they going to get a new phone. At lunch you could use your phone so you could take pictures of you and your friends and put them on facebook. As long as the phones are off during testing and class periods we should be able to use it. Its not like were going o listen to lil Wayne rap us answers.

So we should be able to have our phones and stuff like that with us at school.

Also, the students may have homework or late work they may need to catch up on, they could use there cell phones as calculators or online dictionary. You may not believe that there are educational tools on our phones, so let us prove to you that we just don't text on our phones.

I am writing to tell you that you should ban cell phones outright. Cell phones are small and can easily be sneaked inside the class room from lunch. They could be easily stolen if a student sets one aside to eat or broken from lunch items like milk. Students may also skip lunch while caught up in a game or texting causing them to lose energy and . These are just a few among many reasons you should ban phones.

Cell phones are quite small, and getting smaller every year. They can easily be sneaked into the classroom and covertly used. Many phones are so thin that you may not even be able to notice them in tight clothing like skinny jeans. Many people who might not normally use their phone during school hours may get caught up in a texting conversation and sneak them into class to finish their conversation.

A lunch room is the perfect place to lose a phone or get it stolen. They are sometimes chaotic, with people on all sides moving around and get up constantly to go to other tables. A student may send a message, then set down their food to eat. Another student may sit down adjacent to them, then get up quite quickly. The student eating may suddenly realise that their phone is gone, and they have no idea who took it. Even if the thieving student did get caught, they could cause all kinds of mischief, like sending hateful messages or bad pictures, and all in the victims name.

A lunch room is also the perfect place to damage or destroy a cell phone. A student could be eating with his phone in front of him, and then be accidentally nudged or shoved. He might spill his milk or some other liquid or semi liquid substance over it, like apple sauce. He could suddenly be set back 200 dollars.

He may even become so distraught over the loss of his phone that he cannot concentrate on his studies as well.

As you can probably see, principal, have phones at any time during the day can cause countless distractions and problems that would all have to be dealt with. Instead of dealing with all of that, you could just put a single simple policy into effect, dealing with every problem before hand.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8
45050F5E7A34,"Dear principal,

I have read the policies you have considered for the use of cell phones during school hours. In my perspective i agree with policy number two. My reasoning is because if you allow students to bring cell phones to school and only let them use phones during lunch periods and other free times they will most likely not obey the rule to turn them off during class time because some might claim ""they forgot to turn them off"" or they ""didn't have time to.""

Although, if you completely ban phones from being on school property there won't be any chances of cell phones being in school classrooms. In addition to not having phones in school students will be able to focus on their academics better. During free time they could do extra credit projects or study for tests and quizzes without the distraction of their cell phones. With policy number two it might even benefit students with their grades. The students most likely won't agree with this policy and are probably hoping for policy number one, in the long term they will become more successful and do better in school.

If you choose to go with policy number one students won't get any benefits out of it other than a few conversations on their cell phones with friends. As you may know students occasionally brake the rules and you'll probably catch a few kids texting during class and did not turn their cell phone off like they were supposed to. Please think about my decision and realize the students will be more successful people in the end with policy number two, instead of wasting their free time calling or texting someone.

Students use phones in various ways: either to talk to their friends, for calculators, but also for emergencies. I do believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school.

I don't think they should have the freedom to text anytime of the day.

I think if you would limit them on texting and stress the rule of no texting in class then Policy 1 would work fine.

I would make sure that when the students walk into class after lunch or one of the free periods that their phones were turned off.

It wouldn't take much time to check this, but it would make sure that the policy was working.

If you made a rule about NO phones at all, I think a lot of parents would be a little aggravated.

A lot of things could happen in a day of school: fights, a change in plans at the last minute, or even a family member in need and that student needs to know.

If you limited the rules to where no phones were allowed a lot of things could happen and if it is an emergency that person has a less likely chance of getting help when they need it.

During the free periods, if the student does have their phones out texting, I would suggest that they keep their phones on vibrate or silent.

This would be very courteous to the person next to them studying for a test or reading just for fun.

I hear that you are doing some new policies at school, and I was thinking you should do policy 1, to let students bring phones to school and use them during other free times. Phones are very helpful at school, and deserve to have them at school. When you are in math class you can use it for a calculator, when you are staying after school you can call someone and let them know, and if you are lost.

First you should let students have phones at school because they are useful. When you are in math class and you don't know a multiplication problem you can use the calculator on your phone which is must faster. Also if there isn't enough calculators at school you can just use your phone. It will make everything faster and easier.

Another thing, you can use your phone after school, so if you are staying for an activity you can let your parents know. Because what if you don't have a phone with you and your parents will never know where you are at. Also if you use the schools phone, your parents might not recognize that number and might not answer.

Lastly, phones are useful when you are lost. If you have your phone with you, you can just call your friends and see if they can help you. And if it's the first day at the school you don't have to be looking for people and just text them to see where there at instead of being a loner.

I think cell phones should be allowed in school but not during class. Policy one is the one i agree with for many reasons. One reason is that phones can be a way for education. Now phones can go on the internet, and check your email. If the teacher asked for a certain thing in school and next hour was lunch. He/She would be able to go on the internet on their phone and find the information. Cell phones can also be a way to communicate if u need help in spare time. You could call up your friend and ask them for help if they are maybe in a different class. When the phones are off in class they do not create a disturbance to other people. So they do not get their cell phones taken away. It also can just help them if they needed a ride home because something came up. If you needed to stay after school for example, you could call your parents or a friend during lunch or spare time and then nothing to worry about. That is why I think cell phones should be allowed in school, but only during lunch or spare time.

I think that you should follow policy 2 .Event though i love using my cell phone and do use it in class some times i think that they will become a huge distraction during school. First of all if kids get to use there phones during class breaks or when they are done with there work they will rush through it and do a bad job on it because they want to text or play on there cell phones. i know this will happen because i would do the same thing and also in the fifth grade. We got to go on the computers in the back of the classroom when we were don with our work and all of the kids would rush through there work and get Fs on there papers. After the teacher realised this she stopped letting us go on the computer when we were done. since she did this all the kids took more time on there work and got better grades. Also kids texting would distract the kids doing there work with all the vibrating and the ring tones because event if we wert allowed to have the sound on kids still have it on and say they forgot to turn it off and complain when the teacher took it away. Also if kids had to turn it off during work time they wouldn't and when there ring tone goes off during a test or quiz the teacher would half to take it away and the school would half to have a lot more phones and issue more detentions. Another thing is students would text students in other classes and if the other student forgot to turn there phone of, there would be one more phone taken away and the student who received the text would get two extended detention and probably get grounded by there parents.

Half of the school brings there phones into class anyway. They text, go on face book, play games, some even talk on the phone. Most kids go to the bathroom to text and talk to people so I think that you should at least let people use there phones at floor. because that would probably stop most of them from texting during class if they can look forward to texting during floor and lunch time and other free times they have during school hours. I don`t see why people can not have phones during class.

I think that policy number one should be the policy for out school. If you do not allow students at school to have their cell phones that probably wouldn't be that good for the teachers and the students. Lets say that you have an emergency at school and the kid doesn't have his cell phone to call his mom or dad. He would be in a bad situation and the no cell phone policy would come back to haunt you. I think that policy one is great. If teachers catch the students using their cell phone then their should be a punishment after a certain amount of times being caught. I think that it would be fair if they could use them during lunch periods and stuff like that. If they are turned off during class, they shouldn't be a distraction to their learning.

I am not saying that policy two is not a good idea but students wouldn't be themselves if they didn't have their cell phones. Their could be some good things that come out of not having cell phones at all. If you didn't have cell phones at all during school then the teachers wouldn't have to worry about kids texting and could focus on teaching the class. Also, you might see some grades improve if you take away cell phones. Now their are probably some negative things about kids not having cell phones. If a kid has an after school activity and he doesn't have anything to contact his parents then you might have a problem. Some students might argue that if they can not have cell phones them teachers wouldn't be aloud to either.

I think that policy one would be the way to go if I was you Principal. With that students would be able to contact their parents if they had an after school activity. Maybe something bad happened to one of their family members and they wanted to be notified, with their cell phone they would be.

I believe that policy 1 is the better choice. I believe that policy 1 is the better choice because students should have some freedom in school. If a student was using there cell phone in the class room this student should get there cell phone back after class is over. IF there cell phone makes a noise with the teacher is talking, while students are taking a test, or if the cell phone just makes noise in class the student should be reminded that all cell phone should be turned on silent during your class times. School should not be like a prison to children. School years for a child growing into an adult should be the best years of there life not the worst. The students should have there rights about be about to have a say in certain things.

If some student in the class room gets extremely hurt like brakes an arm the students should be able to call that students parents and call 911 if needed.

These are just a few reasons why i believe that policy 1 is a better choice than policy 2.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

To Whom It May Concern:

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.

I believe that you should allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during passing period and lunch time. phones should have to be turned off during class so students cannot text or call each other but i still think we should be able to have them on campus.

Many students who do text during classes should have their phones taken away or their parents should know better than to allow a irresponsible person to have a phone in the first place.

If they are dumb enough to take the cell phone out in class let them suffer with the consequences but please do not take away that right for everybody.

I am sure that if you allowed them during lunch and passing period less people would text in class and that would allow them to learn more.

also, eventually, by the spreading of people turning off their phones in class, less and less people would text during class until there would be no body texting during class.

Also, many people bring their phones to school so that they can get a hold of their parents after school. i even know people who aren't allowed to text during school or they get their phone taken away for one month per text.

thinking about it there should also be a policy where your phone has to go in a little cubby or something during class that way it wont get stoled and you wont have that sudden urge to text, then at the end of class, you go up and you have to tell the teacher your phone number in order to get it back. either that or you could just say 'oh, well . if it got stoled that's your fault for bringing it to school.""

Still for all of us who don't text during class, don't take that right away because its not fair that we don't have our phone out until schools over so why should we be punished for it? I don't think we should and neither do a lot of other people.

Also, if we don't text during class but we know we can after wouldn't that make us kind of look at it as a reward to try our hardest?

Then so many more people would get a better grade that it would be amazing.

also, i believe that if you allow the students to have their phones out during lunch it could help with language arts because , think about it, if you really wanted to you could have them write in complete words instead of jk, lol, or bcuz. so do the school and our students a favor and allow phones at school.

sincerely,

As a student, of course, I would not agree with the ""no cell phone policy."" Students are always on there phone's, and quite recently, there have been several incidents regarding a cell phone. examples like: texting in class, the phones going off in class and being a disruption. I do understand your concern for a change. IF you do allow policy 1 (allow the students to bring the phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.) I believe there should be some modifications involved.

I am in agreement to both policies, but I am more along the lines of policy one. Policy one is stating that the use of cell phones are okay to be using in school to a minimum. I am concerned that students would take advantage of this offer, so minor consequences should be involved, example: referral. Another concern I have is if the students forget or do not have time to turn off and back on there cell phones between passing periods. I am not concerned about the lunch period however, you have about thirty minutes to make sure your cell phone is turned OFF before entering a classroom.

Technology is at it's greatest in this century, there is practically every device you could think of. Including a device that will ruin reception in the classroom. If the student's phone is not turned off before entering the classroom, it would be no use to use, the device would cut all reception. I do believe this should be placed in every classroom. This will cut all worries of your phone going off in class or a disruption from a text.

Although it may lower all those causes, it will also lower the amount of referrals being given out to the students who do chose to text in class and get caught. As for the students who do have there phone's out and get caught with them, a referral should be given.

I do not think phone's should be allowed during passing periods. You will have at least five minutes to turn your phone on, send a text or two, and turn it back on, and still be on time to class. I think it will cut into passing time. You will see a trend of students being late to there class because they are caught up in sending a text rather than being focused to get to class on time.

With a few perfecting modifications, I do in fact believe this policy will be do-able. I am in full agreement with the policy, with the changes applied. Phones should be located on the student incase of any emergency, they will be able to contact parent/guardian or 911. Regardless, I do NOT agree with policy 2 in ANY way.

I understand that you are considering two possible policies that have to do with using cell phones in school. I think that you should think of allowing students to bring phones to school and let them use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. thirty percent of the population of children are getting in trouble in school because of the use of cell phones in school.

First of all, if students have cell phones then they will be tempted to use it and might get in trouble if they use it in class secretly because they are not allowed to use them in school. Lets say that students are in class and they feel the urge to text because they have not used the phone that day. They will want to use it in class but they will do it secretly so the teacher wont take it away. For example there was this kid in my class and while we were in the middle of the lesson he would take out the phone while the teacher had her back to us and start using it. If you put the policy that will let us use our cell phones in school during lunch periods and free time then we will have enough texting done so that we will not need to text anymore until school is finished or until their next free time.

Second of all, if we were able to use our phones in lunch periods or free times then what will be the point of students getting in trouble all the time because of cell phones. Just think about it, if students aren't able to use their phones in school at all then they will use it no matter what the case is because they feel the urge to do it. They will feel the need to do it because either they receive text that will make them want to reply back or they become so obsessed with using them that they think that they have to use it.

Lastly, you wont have teachers complaining about their students not paying attention in class due to the fact that the students are always on their cell phones. Most teachers have to stop the lesson because they have to waste their time taking students cell phones away. If you put the policy that students can use their phones at free times and lunch periods then teachers wont be interrupted anymore and will just have to worry about teaching the students about what they have to learn to pass to the next grade.

Finally, that is why it would be a great idea to put the policy that will let the students use their cell phones at free times and lunch periods. I mean sure if students aren't allowed to use their phone at all because of school rules then they might be willing to not use it because they wouldn't want it taken away. But just think about the amount of students that will be able to pay attention in class because they won't need to use their phone. I hope you take my letter to consideration and put a policy that will allow students to use their phones freely during free times and lunch periods.

I was regarding your ideas for allowing or banning cell phones at your school. The policy that I think would be best is allowing the students to bring their cell phones, but they MUST be turned off during class time. They may use their cell phones during only free periods, lunch, or before school (if the student is on campus), and as long as they are not a nuisance or used in any inappropriate manor.

This policy could make coming to school a more exciting thing for students, and could make them more motivated to learn. Technology is a big thing that students enjoy using, and they would be allowed to bring there enjoyment to school. Another good reason why this policy would work so well involves the student's parents/guardian. If a student has an accident with there clothes, then they could contact there parents, and ask them to bring them a pair of clean clothes, (with office approval of course).

Cell phones can also help new students that have cell phones, so that they can keep in touch with old friends, or relatives, and they will be able to have someone to talk to at their lunch. They won't just have to sit around by themselves, and they won't just have to sit their without talking to anyone. This policy is also a way for students to make new friends, and they are able to exchange numbers and to keep in touch, or to hang out with after school hours. Cell phones can also help students that enjoy doing there homework at free periods, and then they can check their work on the calculators provided in most cell phones.

In conclusion, the policy to allow cell phones at your school is the only right choice for you to make. It can help make new friends, make coming to school fun, and can help keep students in touch with their parents and friends at all times. This policy is can also help the new students who never really enjoy coming to a new school, but in some ways, they can still keep in touch with their old friends. I hope you consider my choice, and use this policy for your school to keep your students learning, while still having fun when they come to school.

I believe that all students should be given the privilege of being able to use their phones during lunch. As long as we do not use them during the day and turned them off it would be no distraction the class or the teacher trying to teach it. This should be a good policy because it would not be distracting, it is a good way of talking to our friends, and it would get rid of the need to move table to table to talk to all of your friends.

Cell phones would not be distracting during lunch because the lunch room is loud enough as it is, it would not disturb anyone. You cannot distract anyone lunch because they are talking to their own friends and not paying attention to anyone else.

Furthermore, the only thing to do at lunch is eat and socialize with your friends and that what you would be doing when texting. It is the same thing.

Furthermore, cell phones should be allowed at lunch because it is a more efficient and convenient way of talking to our friends. This would decrease the unnecessary yelling and overall loudness of the room. Therefore, making it easier on the staff, lunch ladies, and student.

Lastly, cell phones would be a good thing for us and everyone during lunch. because it would get rid of having to go back and forth from tables to talk with your peers. Most lunch staff find this annoying for reasons i do not know, but if we were capable of texting each other we would have no reason or excuse to do this.

Cell phones during the day would be a serious distraction to everyone in a learning environment because of the ringing, buzzing, and irritating sound of your fingers typing in words. However, it would benefit everyone if we had access to our phone during our free period of time. In conclusion we should have the right to use our cell phones during lunch.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
095D057ACAD7,I do think that having cell phones at school will be good because students have a hard time having fun when all they can do is work and that's it. when students can text there friends during school hours school will be less harsh and less boring because they will be able to text and call there friends during school and it will also relive some stress on them. also they will concentrate in class instead of just trying to text there friend during the class because they can do that after the class is over and wile there texting there friends there not interrupting the class in any way. were as if they text there friends in class they will most likely get caught and that will interrupt there and all of the classes work time. also when we are at lunch and we are board we don't have to sneak around texting and hiding from security guards and there will be less people having there parent come to school and pick it up and kids wont bring stuff there not aloud to bring because they have everything thing there aloud to have and what they want to have at school already. so there wouldn't be much of a problem having a cell phone at school. so please allow cell phones at our school during free time like before after school during passing periods and lunch,3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I understand your concern for the cell phone policy but i would like to voice my opinion. With being a student myself i can assure you that the opinion of myself falls for most of the student body attending this school.

Cell phones are not just a piece of technology we carry around to look cool. For most of us it is our life line. It keeps us connected to the things going on around us. With today's dangers increasing it tends to make us feel better knowing that at anytime we could wip out our phone and call for help. Its about security. With half of the students needing to walk home after the school day, our phones are a necessity. Without it who would know if we were in trouble? I understand phones may be used as a distraction but you can not simply think banning phones from school property is going to fix anything.

If you ask any member from any school they would probably admit that even if it were not allowed, their cell phones would probably still make their way into their pockets during class. We are simply too attached to let go of our source of communication. Why don't you save yourself all the detentions and parent calls and not make it one of those things people would have to sneak around to have? To me that just sounds like your promoting bad behavior, and who wants that in a school?

I ask that instead of getting rid of phones for good, make a few simple rules as to cage the distractions from occurring. Maybe making phones only available during lunch or passing period when we are not using our brains for school work. As long as they are turned off in class then the distractions should be kept to a minimum thus leaving the school a more focused environment for all.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I believe that it is in the students best interest to choose policy number one.

You should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as longs as the phones are turned off during class.

This would be in best interest of the students here at school, because kids will be less likely to get in trouble due to their cellular devices.

In the long run this will cause less hassle on you because few phones will be taken away and less furious parents having to come in and get their child's phone.

Because you are giving the children an opportunity to operate with their phones during free times, more severe punishments could be put into place if a child's cellular device is to go off during class.

You could make the punishment be as little as a detention or as big as Saturday school/ Friday extension.

This would be beneficial to the kids because they could chat with their friends or communicate with a parent or guardian.

The device could also be used as a studying utensil.

In the long run policy number one that states that you should ""allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class time."" would be better because it will cause less hassle for you.

It will keep the kids out of trouble.

I know that phone are a problem now days because student that bring phones to school are tempter to start texting in school and i think that policy 2 is a very good idea because if srudents are banned from bringing phones to school it will help not only you from taking them away ,but it will also benefit them too because I think it will also benefit them to because they will pay more attention to the class but they will also help them learn better but it will remove unecicary stress

Paying attention in class is hard but it becomes harder when your doing something else like using a phone in class thing is why every year there are more students dropping out from high schools nation wide than ever before . To prevent that in our school i sujest that u pay close attention to that .

Stress. believe it or not a student going to school has more stress than the average adult. having to use a phone with out permission provides more stress then u can believe this is because of being scared of the teacher taking it away

Students will be focused on texting there friends or family and not be focused on taking there studying seriously. Also because in case there is a test teachers will accuse you of cheating because you have your phone out and access to any answer. Another reason can be is the will have bad grades. Students will act defiant. In that case student will not take there school work seriously. Grades would drop less interest will be in school if they have there phones on during class.

My point is that the we should be allowed to have phones in school. Having phones on before school, break and lunch are the only time to have access to our phones. They would probably be an emergency and be needed in any particular time and place. Also allowing us to have phones on during are breaks is not a bad thing its a time for students to relax from any school work and to have a more ""fun"" way to have our breaks here at school. Also phones will be needed for after school in case any body needs to get picked up from school. Students will be able to contact there parents faster then using the schools phone in case anybody has any other activity after school so they wont be late and maintain the same schedule and make us be more responsible in many ways.

I agree with policy 1 because i say that is good to use our phones during lunch periods and at other free times but are phones have to be turned off during class time.

We should be able to use our phones and when we get back to class turn them off for we wont interrupt the class, our classmates, and our teachers. If after that lunch period is finished and other free times are done and we get back to class and if we don't have our phones turned off they could take our phones for not turning them off during class time.

What the teachers can do if they see that we have our phones on in class they could take them away, give it to the principal, give it to us after a few days or let our parents come and pick up our phones. The teachers could take them away and not give them back to us until the end of the day or the next day. If the teachers gives it to the principal we could fill out a paper where it says that we got our phone taken away and we have that paper filled in more than five times we cant bring our phones to school anymore. what they could also do is to give to us after a few days or let our parents come and pick it up to the office.

I think that our principal should gives us a chance to try this to see how we do. If it doesn't work well we will just go back to the way that was before. But i think that if we get the chance we will listen that the only time that we have to use our phones is during lunch periods and other free times.

88C4EAEB95A1,"To The Principal,

The policy that i chose is the first one because i think that the students should be able to use cell phones during free time and lunch so this way they have some time to talk to friends or maybe family to tell them about their day.

Also, i another reason why i like this policy is because the students should be able to have a little time with their phones but should also be learning in their classes that is why they should have to make sure that they have them turned off or on vibrate.

Another reason that the students should be able to use their cell phones is cause what if they need a calculator but if they needed to do that they should first come to you and ask or go to that teacher in that class and ask them if it is ok to use their phone but only for a reason or emergency like needing to call someone to bring stuff that they may have left at home. Here is some reasons that they may need to call someone : leavening homework at home, forgetting their lunch, needing a different pair of clothes, or if they need to picked up just incase they are not feeling good or they are hurt and need some rest.

Their phones could come in handy lets say that the class room has no phone and the teacher or one of the students has fallen and cant get up or something bad has happened how will they get help well there is two ways that the students could get help.

One: The students could leave the class room and go down to the office and get the nurse.

Two: A student cant take out their cell phone and call 911 to get some help down here and get them to the hospital.

To me the second one sounds a lot better because they can just take out the phone and just call them in a quick minute instead of running down the hall and stairs just to get to the office just to use the phone.

So as you can see the students cell phone can become really handy in school but i know they are not allowed and can not be used unless told to but i think that have cell phones with you during school is a great idea but even if you do allow them to be used its not like they could be used 24 seven every day every minute but at least let them be used for reasons that are needed for the phone to be used.

31A655925A8A,"Cell phones are a big part of our society today, but students have problems with bringing them to school and using them whenever and wherever during class time. If not told when and when not students can use their phones, students will use them at anytime including during class and study time. Policy one is a superior choice because students will be able to bring their phones but only use them during free time, there for putting a halt to interruptions during class time. This way students can actually learn and are not worried about texting friends in the middle of class. If you also take them away during study time students can study for a big test they have coming up that week.

If policy two was implemented students would ignore the rule and bring and hide them anyways. Students would not pay attention because they are too busy trying to hide the fact they have a cell phone out during class time. Study time would no longer be ""studying time"" and it would change to ""texting time"". Students do not always follow instructions, of course you will have some that do, but a majority of them will blow it off and do whatever they like.

I believe it is the best for all of the students out there if you were to allow cell phones in school. However, I believe that the rules should be very strict regarding the punishment for cell phone use during class. That is disrespectful to the school and the teacher. Teachers and staff should be aware of this as well. If they were to catch anyone with a cell phone out during the times they are not allowed to, they should be ready to report him/her to the principal.

Cell phones play a major role in adults' and teenagers' lives. If you were to take them entirely away from campus, some teens would go ballistic. Several teenagers depend on cell phones for emergencies regarding a sick family member, reports on a pregnant mother or sister, or another probable event that may be happening to them and their family.

However, you may wish to ban them completely, and it is not my job to control whatever you say in this matter. You are the principal and it is your job to work out these decisions and solutions.

Yet, I still have an opinion and feel that I should have a say in whatever may happen. This country's laws say that I have the right to do so. All citizens have the right to protest and the right of speech, and I will take advantage of those rights at this time. I hope I can make a difference in one or more of those teenagers' lives that believe they have to have a cell phone.

My hope is to have put a student's opinion in your mind permanently, and that you will keep it in mind as you make your conclusion about our school's policy on cell phone use. I leave this message with you as a reminder that students care and will fight for their rights to keep their certain belongings with them at all times.

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I have read and understood that you are considering to two policies for cell phone usage in your school. I have read both and i think that the best policy is that you allow the students to have their phones during lunch and other free times. I think this is best because giving students the time to have their phones out when there is free time gives them the time that they need to have their own personal time. When students are having to hide their phone in class this just makes more interruptions for the teacher to have to handle, but if they had their phone out in free time then there would be less interruptions for the teacher and the students wouldn't have to worry so much for getting caught with it or having to hide it. I think that giving these students the chance to have a little bit more freedom and not having to hide everything that they do would make the classroom more comfortable for the students and the teacher as well. Teachers make students feel like children when the students are getting yelled at for having phones and it just makes the whole class become uncomfortable to them. When the students have a feeling to hide something such as a cell phone, they become self aware and make things very uncomfortable for the whole class. Letting students have their phone would give them the freedom to talk with the people they wanted to without interruptions and there would be more peace and not so much tension throughout the school. When the students are hiding their phones behind books or papers they are more likely to get caught and get in trouble with not only the school but the parents as well. Letting them have their phones during acceptable times would let them have the freedom to talk but it would still make the classroom a better place in whole by teaching them but still letting them have their own personal time.

I think students should be allowed to use there phones during class, I think we should be allowed to use any electronic or wireless device. Sometimes we have nothing to do at all so why cant we just text are friends or listen to are ipod's they don't bother anyone at all. Teacher's should only take them up if there being a distraction to other student's but other than that they don't bother anyone. Another thing were always on are phones anyway' s, people always text in class even though there not suppose to there is no purpose for these kids not to have there electronics out what if it's an emergency? Then we should have them out without teacher's yelling and doing what they do when we have them out. Lunch is a perfect hour to have them out I know it would make us less loud because we'd be entertained with are electronics. Everyone take them out anyway' s and just hide them when a teacher or anyone that might take it up come by. I think we should just try it and see how it goes, if we decide to make a bad decision we get are privilege taken away.

When it's time for class we put them up, and concentrate. For a fact I know I would be concentrated and quiet if I can listen to my ipod during a test or study time as for my phone I would only pull that out if I got a text or A call. Phone's should be allowed because are parents bought it for us to use not to just have in a bag or pocket to look cute, like we can dye are hair or wear accessories we can have are phones out there's no point of us not having are electronic' s out. If we don't want to listen we wont it's are choice, Whoever made this law up not to have electronics out is a hypocrite because for a fact he or she's writing it on a laptop, has his or hers phone out calling his or her' s employees or co-workers. The government sale's these electronics and now they want to say we can't use them in certain places it's pointless.

I believe that cell phones should be allowed at school. There are a lot of people that get sick or need to call there parents for an emergency. A lot of people have a sickness and need special vitamins and pills and their parent need to bring it to them. Also break and lunch is their free time to get away from work and teachers to do something else but work. In that free time they may use their phone.

Most kids are responsible enough to put away their phone in class. The parents get the kids a phone for a reason .They trust their kid with it so why cant the schools. The phone isn't doing any thing to the schools. It isn't messing with other kids. So why cant we just bring them to school and use them only during break, lunch and for emergency's. Policy number one is the best choice for this situation.

I believe the policy with phones not being at school should be required. Students can get mad all they want to , if you see a phone at school you should take it don't give them another chance , because the students should know that the phones shouldn't be brought to school anyways. My belief on bringing phones are no because , you come to school to learn not text or call some one everyone needs their education and if you don't want it , well it is someone out their that wants it ; so don't stop someone from getting their education because you want to be selfish. Back in the day, people had to sneak around just to get their education , today they are offering it to you, and you let it go. People don't have to take time out their day just to help you learn. A lot of people think that's cute now you will not think it's cute when it is going to be hard to get a job or to get into college. I understand people wont to talk to their friends, and gossip , but give it a brake. If you bring your cellular device to school, then you would be worried about your phone so much you wouldn't be able to focus or pay attention. Your education is extremely important so don't throw it away all because you wanted to tell your best friend something or text someone in class just to be cool.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I socialize through my cell phone. Most students do. We text or call people in case of emergencies, if a friend is sick we text them to tell them what homework they missed, and we can communicate without disturbing the people around us. I think we should be allowed cell phone usage in our free time and lunch periods because it can help the students that are sick, and we can check out homework against other students.

Did you know that 45% of students that are sick and out of school have trouble catching up? If we have contact to them during the school day, we can help that number go down. For example, my friend STUDENT_NAME texts me on the bus, ""I'm sick, can you tell me what I missed in all of my classes?"" If I can't tell her between every class I might for get something. Being able to call or text between classes would let us help sick students. Then teacher won't have to take time out of class to re-teach yesterday's lesson to the students that were absent. It would be a service to us the students, and the teachers.

Most friends of students have might have moved away. How do we communicate? We call or text them whatever chance we get so we don't lose their friendship. Don't we go to school to improve social skills as well as learn all we need to be successful? While keeping in touch we can learn things about where they are now living and have more knowledge. I like to learn about unknown places, don't you?

Did you hear about the student that was stuck at school after the whole building burned to the ground? Their school didn't permit cell phone usage so she didn't bring her phone to school. If there is an emergency at our school, shouldn't we be able to contact our parents right away? If there is a real emergency, or if we forget our homework, we need a way to contact parents through our cell phones to help us.

Most students that miss school get behind in their work. Then they might not ever catch up. If we are allowed cell phone usage in free periods and lunch, we will not be tempted to use them during class. We use our phones to stay in touch with friends that have moved, for emergencies, and to help friends stay on track with their school work. If you want a school where everyone is on the same page, permit cell phone usage in free periods and lunch.

I am writing you this letter to in form you that all cell phones at school must be abolished. letting students be able to use cell phones is a bad idea.

If students are able to use their cell phones at school it will make room for distractions and detentions. In schools, 80% of students have cell phones. This many students using cell phones would permit a bad influence. For example, students suing cell phones at luch will be louder than usual, most likely up and about trying to get peoples numbers, and very likely to throw or try to damage other peoples phones. Also, kids who like to cause trouble, will most likely try to use their cell phone or not turn it off rite away at times when you are not aloud to use it. Having kids able to use cell phones will only add to distractions and safety hazards.

Some might argue that letting students use their cell phones in school is a good idea because they would get to talk to their friends and be in better moods. However, students have plenty of social time already. They have their lunch periods, between classes, after school, and many teachers do give students some time to socialize with friends for at least a couple minutes. More time for students to socialize would be too much and they would not focus enough on their work. Therefore, letting students use their cell phones in school hours is unacceptable.

In conclusion, cell phones in school hours would not be a good addition to school systems. Students using their phones would be a distraction to the learning environment. It would also influence bad behavior on students. Lastly, it would give students more social time, which would take away the students attention from their work. As you can see, cell phone use in school hours must be abolished.

I think that's better because the students already bring in phones and use then during class while the teacher isn't looking or not paying attention. But , if the principal lets the students use their cell phones at lunch or free time in school then they wont have to hide anything from the teacher and be sneaky , some students do do that and if they get caught , they get in a lot of trouble. If the rule is NOT to use the cell phones then i don't get why they do it anyway , there isn't even ever anytime to text someone while in class because the teachers always keep us all busy. If one of the students get caught , you have to tell your parent to go up to the school and go get it. I would find it fair and better if the principal let us use our phones in school , just not in class. I always get in trouble for taking my phone out when i get OUT of school just because I'm still on the ""school grounds."" They don't do anything about anyone taking their phones out after school if they see you they just ask you nicely to not use it or put it away while on school grounds.

If it was an emergency I'm sure they would let you use your phone or any phone. I don't think the principal would never give you a hard time about your phone being out on school grounds if it was an emergency or something important. But , from my opinion , it think it would be a better idea to just let the students use their phones in their free time. I think all the students would be very happy with that and agree with it , that way they don't have to get in trouble for texting and being accused of being a bad kid because they were texting in class. That's no fair if you get in trouble but mean while if you have free time why not use your phones while you can.?",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I believe no cell phones is the way to go. I believe this because students who use cell phones in school will be off task and no do there work.

One reason why i think this is because the students need to get a education and n not worry about that text they just received.

Another reason i have that might convince you to listen to this is because if you follow up with this rule students in the school will stop worrying about phones and more about school.

Witch means better grades and behavior and also better testing scores.

Maybe even less drama because as you see there are many conflicts that come from texting and social net works because someone said something over a text message.

So by not allowing this you could possibly prevent fights, and other harmful situations from happening.

Students also have all before school and after school even weekends to text so it shouldn't be happening in school.

If you were to let the students have their cell phones out and let them text, they wouldn't pay attention in class, not no what there doing, and get bad grades on important test and even homework.

they also might not listen to the teacher when he or she is talking witch might aggravate them and become mad at the student.

To finalize this statement i have to share with you i would like to say if you consider this idea this could really change how the school runs and make things better then they were.

So thank you for reading this and hopefully you consider this idea for a better and brighter future.

I heard that you were reconsidering the cell phone policy and I have some reasons that I would like to share with you why I think you should pick the first policy. I think that you should pick the first policy because us teens love having our cell phones with us all the time, and if you let us use our cell phones at lunch and other free times its pretty much a treat. The reason I say its like a treat is because when were in class a lot of people text and most of the time they get caught but if you give us the opportunity to use them in free time there will probably be less kids getting there phones taken away and less distractions.

I think that you shouldn't pick policy two because if you tell students not to bring there phone to school, were going to do it anyways. There will probably be more distractions in class such as ring tones going off, text message alerts going off, and people calling. Another reason I believe you shouldn't pick policy two is because what if a students parents need there child to have there cell phone so just in case something after school happens. Like they're going to be at the store when you get home so use your key to get in or even emergency things like if a family member is in the hospital so don't ride the bus we'll pick you up from school. These are the reasons that I believe you should pick policy one because it would keep the students happy and the school staff happy.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
90764819E3A9,"I think Policy one is the right policy. Think about most people need to have there phones at school because maybe after school they need to call someone to pick them up. Or maybe they have no lunch money and they didn't bring a lunch so they need to call their parents to bring them one. I mean I've had to call my parents before during school to tell them I needed something. One time I forgot to bring my book to school and I left it at home. So I called my mom to bring to school for me and she did. So I got a hundred on bring my book to school that day. Think if something happened like the mom got a flat tire driving to school to pick them up. Then they would need a phone so they're parent could call them and tell them they needed to find a ride home. Think if the principle told them you couldn't have a phone at school. They could be sitting at school waiting for their mom to come get them but it never happens because they don't have a phone and the persons mom couldn't tell the kid she had a flat tire. Making a rule for a kid not to be able to have a phone at school would be outrageous. I also think it's a great plan to let the students be able to use their phones at lunch and dearing passing periods, not like it will effect anyone. Plus

I've seen kids go crazy at school because they forgot to bring it to school it's amazing. If really think taking kids phones away during school is going to help your living in a fantasy world. It's not the phones it are making grades go down it's because they make school no fun, so it's boring and no one wants to even be there. If people really want kids to have better test scores make school have more energy in it. No kid wants to learn in a boring environment. So yes policy one is ten times better then policy two. If they really want kids to get rid of their phones then make all the teachers including the principle get rid of her. Also make them only be able to office phone if it's an emergency. I know no teacher would go for that, so why do kids need to get rid of their phones.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
B33AAEEF92E5,"Dear principle,

The purpose of this letter is to say which of the new policy for cell phones is a better selection for the school.

I believe that the first policy would be more effective. If you allow them to use cell phones at lunch they won't have to do it in class. This would be a big help so teens can pay attention more to their academics other than their friends on texts, which could raise grades and help them perform well on assessments.

The second reason why this would be a good strategy is because some parents like to keep in touch with tier kid after school. Some need it to contact their parents to get a ride home. if you do not allow phones it will make their lives at home harder than it already is. It won't settle with adults and parents will send their kids to school with phones anyway. This will only anger parents and wont help the school at all.

The new policy could make cafeteria's softer because some kids will be texting and not talking. This would make cafeteria workers happier too so it also affects the school staff as well. This proves why the first policy would work better than not letting phones in school at all.

I know that you're considering to let us students use cell phones during free time, and lunch. In my opinion that is a great idea. I think it's a great idea, because it gives the students what they want in some ways and it helps parents too. Sometimes parents have to contact their children, because maybe they have to walk home or have something very important to do. This would give parents time to contact their children so they can give them that information. I think its also a good idea that once they get to class they have to turn off their phones. Turning off their phones is good because then students can't complain how they can't use their phones during school. Which would be a lie if they said that. It would be a lie because they can use their phones during school, just not in class. They should be turned off in class because we students have to learn. We won't learn if we keep texting in class, because then our grades would start dropping, and parents wouldn't be happy about that. We students have to have our phones, our phones are our life technically. Being able to use them partly during school would make us a lot happier. It wouldn't let us fully use our phones during school, but atleat we do a little bit. Students and even me wouldn't complain about turning them off in class, atleast i know i wouldn't. Also if you just ban phones entirely from the school then students are going to use their phones during class, and as i mentioned before, that wouldn't be good. Letting students use their phones sometimes would be better then never letting them use their phones because then they will sneak around with them.

I believe in Policy number 1. Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I believe kids should have their phones during free times because if there was an emergency at school like a lockdown, the kids can call 911 and their parents to let them know that everyone is all right and maybe come pick their kid up. The same rule applies to a fire drill. If their was an emergency, a phone in the hands of hundreds of students would come in handy. Some students have those types of parents, the over protected parents who encourage their kids to take something to school at least to contact their parents once or twice a day to let their parents know they are all right. Even if taking phones to school is against the rules some kids do it. When the kid uses the phone in school, most of the time the teachers don't even notice because they are teaching a class of twenty to thirty kids and the teachers cant be focused on one particular kid or even search kids to see if they have their phones. As long as the kids pay attention in class with their phones turned off and out of site, then i think a phone would be fine in school. The kids should be allowed to use their phones during a free period because the kids aren't learning or being taught information during that time, the kids are having fun with their friends talking about teenage life. Policy two doesn't work for me because if there was a lockdown drill and nobody could get to the phones to call 911 because if they tried moving to another room to do that they would get caught by the bad guys, the phones in the hands of hundreds of kids would come in handy because then they could call 911 quietly in a safe room and get help saving their school from what could possibly have been a shootout.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Cell phones should be allowed at school. Kids could be in an emergency and need to call for help. Kids can also use cell phones for getting a ride. Those are my reasons for cell phones being absolutely necessary in school.

I believe it is necessary for students to be able to use their phones at school. If they were not able to have phone at school then they could not be able to call for help if they are kidnapped. Kids could also need to call the cops and report that someone is being mugged or robbed. There could be someone with a gun at school getting ready to blow peoples brains out with a cell phone they could call the cops and have them save everyone. Kids could be separated from their group on a field trip and need to call to set up a place to regroup.

There are other reasons to like if their parents forgot to pick them up from school one day then they could call them and ask for a ride home. They could also call to let parents know they are going to a friends house after school so their parents could pick them up later. Kids could go on a field trip and need to get a ride home from someone who they know. Kids could need to tell someone their bus crashed, and there are a bunch of kids stuck on the side of the road who need rides home.

Cell phones are a part of everyday life why should they not be allowed at school. If people can use them at work why can't students use them at school? Cell phones are a part of life that are now a necessity to live in this modern world. Kids need them to Get ride to places and to use in an emergence. Cell phones must be allowed at school for the safety of the kids.

I strongly support policy 1, which allows students to bring and use their cell phones during school as long as they are turned off in class. Students have the right to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times. With applying this policy, students do not have to suffer to try and hide their cell phones during class. It is also good for the teachers, without this policy teachers may have to stop lessons and talk to other students trying to text in class.

With this policy, students have a free right to use cell phones during any free period of time and don't have to worry about teachers catching them. Although I would advise all teachers, before class to check every students' cell phone to make sure they are completely turned off and put away. This also includes the librarian checking for students cell phones also.

This policy also rewards some students who work hard in school, and deserve the usage of their phone. If you put this policy to good use, you, as the principal can find out what really is going on around the school. Getting updates from students talking about the latest news and what is soon going to happen. The teachers would also get many updates from their own students at what has been going on.

If needed, you, the principal has the right to check their cell phones for any purpose necessary and can confiscate them. Policy 1 can be put to good use if you imply some kind of other rules if needed too.

I think we should be able to bring cell phones to school because kids can drive to school so they would need someone to pick them up. Also kid need to call there parents if something changes or they need to do something after school. When kids have something goes wrong in school or walking home or kids who do sports after school.

I got a cell phone in 7th grade when i made a sports team after school. if i did not have a cell phone there would be no way i could tell them if i have practice of if i didn't have practice. when i was on the basketball team after school sometimes i had a home game and my parents wanted to go and then when i got to school it changed to a away game and if we couldn't bring cell phones to school my parents would show up at dag and i would be away at a different school. i understand why the principal thinks that it would get kids in less trouble because than kids would text during school and kids steeling phone but it would be good if kids have an after school activity.

It would also be good if we were allowed to bring cell phones to school because if parent have to tell of if there would be a change in plan. One time i got a text and its was my mom saying to be a walker because they had to pick up something after and you have a game. If i didn't have a phone i would take the bus like i was could to that morning and i would miss my game and she would be waiting at the school and i would be home. it is important for kids i have a phone because the parent and kids need to see what is going on after school and where the y need to be after school.

I think you could go with policy number two because no teenager has a use for it when you go to school. For example, a teenager doesn't need a phone during school hours, if a teenager needs to use a phone he/she could ask the teacher if he/she could use it for emergency reasons. Another example is that, if a teenager wants to text a friend he/she could do it when they arrive at their house to text them all about their day at school or something.

Texting or calling in school is a big distraction for their education in school. A person can live if they don't text or call for at least eight or ten hours can't they? If they could then why bring a phone to school if you know the teacher is going to take it from you. I mean I don't want to lose my one hundred twenty dollar phone to the school or drop it and not even know i did these are some two reasons why i wouldn't want to bring my phone to the school.

Education always comes first is what my parents say about school, so if i need to text someone, i can hang on to it for a while and get my education first, so i can achieve in life and get a job so I can pay for the bills myself and not waste my mom and dad's money on my own phone bills.

I believe that we should have Policy 2. If we were to use our cell-phones during lunch or free time there would be a rise of Cyber bullying, it will lead to people getting there cell-phones stolen, and it is a big distraction. All of my reasons for Policy 2 are about the safety and education of the students here at SCHOOL_NAME. So we should go with Policy 2 because there would be a rise of Cyber bullying in the school, people would have there cell-phones stolen, and it is a big distraction.

One reason why I believe that the school should follow Policy 2 is that there would be a rise in Cyber bullying. Cyber bulling is the use of technology to bully someone. Would you not think that if a school yard bully got his hands on a cell-phone that he/she would try to pass his or her aggression on by using a text or phone call? Cyber bulling is dangerous and should not be taken lightly. I am not saying that Cyber bulling will happen but there is just to big of a risk.

Another reason of mine that I think that Policy 2 would be the best choice is that cell-phones will be constantly getting lost or stolen. Not every family wants their child to have a cell-phone. And if they don't have one there going to look at every one else and get jealous. Also cell-pones now a days are small. If they fall out of your pocket or book bag it could take a long time for it to reaper. You'd have to file the report and it would be oh so time consuming. There should be no cell-phones in school because they are easy to lose and easy to get stolen.

The third reason why we should have Policy 2 is because they are to much of a distraction. I would love just to whip my cell-phone every time I wanted to call one of my friends, but that is to distracting. We come to school every day to get an education; not to talk with friends. Students grades would start to suffer because they couldn't stop thinking about what there peers are doing. So cell-phones are a distraction and that is why they should not be in school.

Having a cell phone with you while you in school is good because what if there is an emergency in our family or something wrong happen to some one. Policy one is the best choice to have because if the teacher can trust while we have our phone we wont break that trust.

There is nothing bad we can do by having our phones with us, we cant kill or do nothing bad with them just talk and text that the only thing we usually do with phone. If we had policy 2 how would our family know were we are and what time we coming home. With out cell phones in school it would pretty much be unsafe to go or come back from school. If there was a drill where some one came into the school or had a gun while we where in school how would we be able to contact the outside world or what place we by where and what to do. The best part about having cell phone is we can text with out talking with out teachers getting mad because we talking or yelling that way they wont be mad all the time and have some quite time to her self or him self.

My final thought about all this is that student and teacher if teachers want we should be able to have cell phones. If policy 2 is the best choice how would teachers feel if they couldn't have cell phones not just because they are teaches means they could have one but if it was equal for every one. the same goes to every one what if they were all student of there job and they couldn't bring cell phones to there job it would be bad for them because they have things they need to do and people to contact.

38D37BF69E5F,"Dear Principal, I think policy 2 should be put into effect because there is no need to have cell phones at school and they just cause disturbances anyway. If kids were texting during their free time they might carry on a conversation into school time and get caught. That would be a big disturbance for the whole class.

Kids don't need to have cell phones in school because they usually text their friends who are already at school with them. Why not just walk over and talk to them; it's easier and a whole lot faster and you won't cause as near a big disturbance if you were just whispering to them in class.

Without cell phones kids couldn't send out big rebellious texts like what happened at our school. We had a big talk because one person decided to text everyone and tell them to do what the principal said not to do. The principal was very unhappy and banned a lot of clothing brands.

Another good reason to ban cell phones is because it prevents the kids from doing their work which in turn gets them bad grades. If someone is texting secretly instead of doing their work then they can't finish in time and that lowers their grades. Plus it distracts the person they're texting from doing their work also. So really for every person that texts in school it's lowering 2 people's grades.

I have a cell phone but I never use it during school unless someone sends me a text. Usually I don't even answer the text back. Texting can even distract kids that are smart and get good grades even though they don't send a text.

I think it would be a great idea to go with policy one. What it is really hurting if a student uses their cell phone at lunch or any other free time they have. I do agree that they cant have them during class because when we are in class we are here to learn in our classes. So what are we really hurting? So when you are done reading this will you please give this letter some serious thought for me.

With policy number one most kids in my opinion would love to use their cell phones during lunch or their free time, but don't get me wrong if they have them during classes I feel you teachers have every write to take them away. So going with policy one is the best way to go. Most kids would probably think that they have the coolest principle on the whole district. Really what does hurt if we use are cell phones during our only half an hour or our five minutes of passing time?

When we have are cell phones at lunch what or who are we really hurting? And when we have are cell phones during passing time its not going to hurt anyone if we have are cell phones during those times. And if we don't have them during classes I'm fine with that. It's just that I don't get why we cant have cell phones even during our lunch hour. That is the only free time that we get to have during our hour from 8:30a. m to 3:30p. m do you see where I am coming from?

So you see, what is the bad thing about having cell phones during passing time or at lunch. As long as we follow the rule about not having cell phones in class I think policy one is an excellent idea. So you see principle why I would go with policy one which states you may have your cell phones during free/passing time or during our lunch hour. So if you could take the time and think about what I just wrote about that would mean a lot to me. Policy one I think is the best policy and that's the policy I believe is better than policy number two.

I believe that yes cell phones can be distracting, and take away from learning time, but look at the advantages what if you are in a bad situation, and need to call for help, or maybe just need a ride you cant call into the wind for that . Cell phones provide advantages for the user. even then calling in class shouldn't be allowed reasons to believe it just really distracts students, and if you do come to a compromise cell phones should at least be turned off during school classes but still i do not see at that point of view that the providing of more disadvantages will stop.

So yes I believe that students should b e allowed cell phones just not on every bases for example. Shouldn't use them during main classes like math science, and so on nor should they use them during passing time really consumes most of it, and prevents them from getting to class on time. See as it may that will be a problem, but for the most part lunch is really not a very bad time to pull out the cell phone, because it is not taking out of there class time they are probably not causing trouble, and not annoying others, but that also means that if seen texting in class or making a call it is necessary to take it away.

In those reasons, and beliefs that i offer, and share with you i believe that you will see that some of these advantages will be good. Disadvantages not as much but hopefully you see it though a different point of view.

I think that you should select the first cell phone policy.

I think that cell phones can be helpful, and important to have and be able to use.

The first policy allows students to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times.

I think that would be a good policy because if the student has forgotten something at home, or needs to ask someone a question, they can.

Phones could even be used for studying with a friend.

It is the student's choice to study or not.

If they can't use their time well to get good grades, that's their problem.

In the real world, there is nobody to make you work.

If you don't choose to work hard, you will get nowhere, and it is your fault.

If students can't ignore the distractions of a cell phone to study, then they will suffer the consequences, and they will only be able to blame themselves.

Teachers could also use phones (while the students are in study hall) to remind students of assignments, or upcoming tests.

The phones won't be on during class, so the students can't cheat on tests, or be distracted.

Also, if you pick Policy 2, students will still bring phones to school.

They will just hide them instead of using them in the open.

Unless every student is searched upon entering the building, there is no way to stop them from bringing their phones.

I hope you will consider these facts when you make your final decision.

Sincerely,

Student",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Greetings, I have read your response and I can see why you are considering this policy awareness. I think that Policy 2 will be the most reasonable and the most effective for the students for their own benefit. The reason I think that this is the policy that should be taken action is because it'll will keep students focused on their studies, it will cause them to do other things besides using their phones, and it will keep them from damaging their brains from texting and staring at a screen all the time.

First, using phones distracts students from their studies and keep them from succeeding in schoolwork and other educational necessities. It makes them all worried about who their texting, the drama, and plans, or other unnecessary things to talk about when in school. It will cause them to fail in their school work and then not pass in their classes. It will cause them to lack behind in their work and also cause them to function poorly. Instead of going home and doing homework, they'll be on their phone chatting away because they have no idea what's going on in school.

Next, when not having a phone or any other distractions, a person can learn and explore more things. In their free time, instead of talking on the phone or texting others, they can have a study group Then maybe read books, or join fun activities in the school campus, or just hang with friends. They can do all of that phone business at home or in their other free time. School is highly important and it plays a huge part in a student's life and it has a big effect on their future.

Furthermore, it will keep the brain from damaging itself form all the staring onto a phone and texting. When to much pressure in talking on doing nothing but staring into a phone and always being on it, can hurt a person.

The brain should be healthy and have an open mind. It can hurt a person from just being all caught up in the drama about which a person is constantly texting, chatting or talking on the phone about all the time. A hobby or some sort of activity in a person's life should take place instead of a phone being a whole person's life story. This can damage the thinking of a brain development.

To conclude, schools should have phones taken away during their house because a students academics is one of the biggest achievements in life and education is very important. Instead of having a phone and person can have other hobbies and experience more things to get ahead in life and prosper. Using phone during class and twenty-four hours of the day is really damaging to the brain. A brain needs to stay healthy and be very open minded. Using phones, texting, chatting, talking, and just this constant entertainment is too much for a student in school. It doesn't bring any goodness to a child's academics and looses focus. This action must be taken. Otherwise if no one reacts we could have a very bad situation in the later years when not many people have taking their education as some thing very serious. Overall I think that taking away cell phones in school would be the best for the students for their own benefit.

49D1E60EB808,"Dear principal, i believe that u should have a policy about cell phones that allows you to have cell phones at school that you can only use during lunch, recess, and passing times. my reasons are because teens like to use cell phones to talk to other teens, what if an emergency comes up?, and what if you forgot something at home and you need to have your parents bring u it from home?

Teens like to talk to each other on cell phones to discuss current events and to discuss their feelings about school other people and their life. they need to outlet their emotions into something. and they should be able to do this at school because school is where most of the problems start out anyway and if they cant vent that out right when it happens then they wont have to deal with it throughout the day until they can get home to use their cell phones to talk to people and tell people about it.

What if an emergency comes up?

Phones are a huge part of our children's lives.

In your first policy you state that you could,

""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.""

In your second policy you state that you, "" Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.""

In my opinion policy number one is the best decision that you could make regarding the students.

The reason i say this is because by letting them have there phones, even at a potion of time, you would not have them sneaking them around as often.

Your letting them have some freedom when it comes to communication, but at the same time you have control over them.

If you chose the second policy you would have a lot of angry parents at your door.

Parents and children need to communicate, and they do this, most often than not, on there phones.

If you took away the only way parents could communicate and talk to their children, all these parents would be upset, and of course worried.

For you see, they would not know if there children were home or gone off to friends house, and they couldn't just call them up and ask because there phones would be with them, but at home.

So, please take into consideration what I've said to you.

I was looking at the policies you have come up with for cell phones. I think you should consider using Policy 1 because this will give students something to look forward to during the day and encourage them to get their work done in class instead of trying to be taciturn by looking at their cell phones during class. I think that if you allow students to look at and use their cell phones during free time the students will be less tempted to look at their phones during class time and when the teacher is talking or giving a lecture. I also believe that when the students begin to get distracted by cell phones or not focused on schoolwork you should take away the privilege and use Policy 2 so that the students know that having and using a cell phone is a privilege not a right and so that the students understand that they can use their cell phones only when they are succeeding in the classroom. They will also know that they can use their cell phones only during appropriate times when they are in and out of school, whether it be at work or in meetings they will be more respectful of the time they are given to look at and use their cell phones.

I think that if you do use Policy 1 the students will be more respectful of the privilege they are receiving and will use their time wisely so that they can use their cell phones during free times when they are not being instructed by a teacher. I also believe that using Policy 1 will cause less problems with cell phones being used at wrong times. It will also cause less hassle with the students not working because they will be encouraged to do their work so that they can use their cell phone outside of class. So when you read this letter I hope you seriously consider my ideas and thoughts when you are deciding on which policy you decide on.

I am here today asking you to have cell phone to be allowed in school to be used at any free time such as lunch, SSR(but students still have to read), free blocks, study hall, and in the hallways at school. For example, what if I want to talk to another person at another school and were both in free time I'm going to want to text him or her to see what is going on and if they want to hang out after school or something like that. If i wait for school to be over I'll probably forget or it will be to late they have other plans. I want to be able to not getting in trouble for things that i should be able to do. If you are worried about people sending people nasty text messages it's still going to happen weather in school or not. The time to change this bad rule is now so go with policy one because even though you must think that your students aren't texting in class the are most likely are you just haven't caught them. i believe that if we did a ratio that 75% out of a hundred kids are texting each other in class but you just don't know it. Students know that teachers look for a little light to see if there texting but the kids aren't that dumb. If the teachers didn't know this already you can dim the light on your phone so that the teachers don't know if your texting because they don't see that little light. All I'm saying is that you will never stop your students from texting in class so why don't you give them all the time they can get from walking to other classes in the hall, free blocks, SSR, and study hall and you will not have to worry about them texting in class because they can just wait every hour or so to texting the hall.

I believe that students should have cell phones during school for 3 reasons. one reason is to inform their parents if something has happened. Also, sometimes other students wants to talk to another student from a different table but they can't get up. Finally, because the parents can tell the parents if something has occurred.

Students should be able to use their phones to inform their parents about some issue that happened recently. Also, sometimes the kid can tell their parents if someone is annoying them and is tempted to fight them, they can tell their parents the situation and the parents can give the student some advise or go and get them before things get out of hand. The parents can also tell the students that their parents are wondering if they can go in for a meeting and they wanted to talk to the teachers.

Many times us students want to go and talk to our other friends about something that happened to them but cant because they cant get up from their seat. The student can send them a text so that they can remain seated and not break the rules. Also you might have a brother or sister and you wanted to tell them something but you cant.

I know that most of student will also agree with the policy too because even if you say don't bring phones to school most students still will. Another reason that we should go with policy 1 is because when your leaving school what if your walking on the street and someone came and took something from you while you was walking with it. It wont be that big of a problem because gladly you will have your cell phone with you and you can call someone for help. Another reason is what if something happen to you and your cell phone happens to fall out your pocket then if someone generous pass you then they will take your cell phone and see if you have your parent number there or call the cops.

I think that the better policy is Policy 1. Policy 1 ,I think makes a better point and gives the students a lot more freedom.

Policy one is a better choice because as long as they aren't doing anything bad with their cell phones I don't see any problem. Also if they don't use them in any of their classes I don't know why anybody else would mind. Students might also need their phones to call their parents if they forgot something etc. Policy #2 takes all of those possibilities away from the students that have cell phones. They should also be aloud to use them during free time and lunch periods as long as they have obeyed the rule and have not had their phones on during any of their during the school classes. I think that schools should let the students try polisy 1 and if they don't follow the rules then the staff/teachers should enforce Policy2.

I think that the you should use Policy 1.

You should use it, because if the teacher tells the student that the volleyball practice is canceled and if you don't have a office phone, then the student can't tell his/her parents about it.

Also, another reason is that, the students won't have to keep on complaining about not having their phone all the time.

When the students get out of school, (on the bus) they can call their parents, if they are going to a friends house.

They can also call the parents with their cell phones, when their after-school activity is done, so then the parents can pick them up.

What if there is an emergency(like a flood is coming) and the office phone is broken. Then, they could get their cell phones out and call their parents and tell them about it, so then the parents can pick them up, before the emergency comes.

The students can call their friends at lunch(if their friend has a phone or has the same lunch as them), so then they could just sit their talking on the phone, while eating.

If the student don't turn their cell phones off during class time, then you should punish them by giving them(any of these):

-a detention

-write an essay that's about why they didn't turn their cell phones off

- apologize to their teacher and let the teacher do the rest

Dear Principal,

I believe that the current cell phone policy at our school is getting out of hand. In order for students to get everything they can out of their class time, you should consider changing the policy. The policy should be that students are allowed to bring their cell phones to school, as long as they are off during class periods and other important times during school hours. Although, during free periods and lunch time the students should be allowed to use their cell phones if necessary. When students use their cell phones during class they lose valuable learning time. That time they spend texting is not letting them put all their best effort into their class work. That may hurt them later on in the future when they're presented with a difficult task. Also, using your cell phone during class time is a sign of disrespect towards your teacher. It is disrespectful because you are showing the teacher you do not care. However, students should be able to bring their cell phones to school and use them during free periods and lunch time for emergency purposes. Free periods and lunch times are for socializing with friends and classmates. By using their cell phones to talk on the phone or text message will not end up hurting them in the long run because they are not missing out on any important educational information. This policy would be beneficial for teachers and students because teachers won't have to worry about students being distracted their cell phones, and students will put most, if not all of their attention to class time.

I just read the two possible cell phone policies. I think that the school should use the first policy, that said you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

I agree with this policy because I think if the students are using their cell phones in the hallway, it is not interrupting or distracting to classes. Another reason I think the first policy is better is that if the students need something, like a ride home from school, they can call there parents during passing periods to tell them that they will be staying after school later and what time to pick them up. That way they will not have to go to the office to call during class. Doing this, they will not have to miss anything in class.

Students should be able to use cell phones at lunch because it is not even a class. They should be able to text or call people during that time. The teachers should allow students to use their cell phones because there is no reason they shouldn't be able to use them at lunch. Lunch and passing periods are supposed to be breaks, so that the students don't have to be working the whole time they are at school. If the students choose to use this time texting or calling people, that should be their own choice.

These are some of the reasons why I think cell phones should be allowed to be used by students during lunch and other free times. I think the teachers should be less strict about using cell phones at these time. Thank you for reading my letter and considering this ideas.

I think we shouldn't have our phones during school hours. I think we should be aloud to use it after school or before school, but once you enter the school there should be a policy for NO CELL PHONES. For example, what if your taking a district test or some kind of important test to get you to the next level and people are secretly texting the answers through there phone and sending it to their friends. If a teacher saw that, it would be an automatic zero and a call home from their parents. But if the teacher didn't see that, then a kid taking the test might have gotten a higher score then failing the test. For more reasons, lets say your a teacher and one of your students get a phone call during class, would you like it while he/she doesn't even bother listening to you teach, while the other kids want to learn? I THINK NOT! These are more reasons why other schools abandon having cell phone privileges. I'm not saying take away the cell phone if the student is not using it and just has it in their pocket for just incase. I'm saying if you see a student using it during school hours.

Dear TEACHER_NAME

It has came to my attention that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I personally am happy, because my cell phone is a big part in my life. I use it all the time and so do my parents. It's very convenient to have during the school year. Most of the cell phones today have internet access. Including my phone. That is something very useful to have even for school. I even see some teachers have their cell phone on one day, because they are expecting a very important phone call.

One of the policies I see you are considering is to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. I think this is the better choice, because if you ever forgot a homework assignment or gym clothes or something important you can ask your parent to drop it off.

Some teachers disagree with this because they say why don't the students just use the office phone? Well if you ever considered what students use the phone, you wouldn't want to use it ever again. A lot of students who call to home are sick. I doubt that the secretaries at the office constantly disinfect the phone.

Also if your parent does drop off something and the secretary announces it over the loud speaker, it disrupts the class. If you had you cell phone, you and your teacher would be the only ones who knows about it. Not the entire class.

I do think that is the better choice and a lot of students will agree as well, but i do see some problems with it. I could predict that because we could use the cell phones during free periods and lunch, most of the students would forget to turn them off. Therefore a there could be more disruptions.

Usually a couple of times a year at least one student's phone goes off during class. I think that this would happen more often because we would be aloud to use them. I think that the policy at school we have now is just fine. We are aloud to have them in school, just put away in the lockers.

I have to admit that when I'm doing my homework and my phone is right next to me, I easily get distracted. I'm sure that a lot of other students would agree that they too get distracted.

I understand that I have to pick one policy and I still think that policy number one is better, but there are problems to it. If I were you TEACHER_NAME, I would just keep the cell phone policy how it is today, or revise policy number one. Thank you for your time.

I have read your two possible policies. Policy one is a good policy the reason why is because know a days all students have a phone. It would be better for you just to let them have a phone because if you don't students will go in their own risk of consequences just to have their phone in handy. If you could notice, also know a days all students really care about is having their phone. That is a really special object to any teenager, your students from your school will really appreciate it if you allow them to use their phone during free time or lunch periods. I can ensure you that is you let this policy go students gradually will love you, and knowing that they can use their phone in those free minutes they will not have the need to use it during the class time. I would have to choose policy one as the most reasonable and it would be fair for both you as the principal and the students of your school.

Policy two will cause the students to rebel against the school just for not letting them bring a phone to school. As you know by now students will go to the extremes for one little thing. Not allowing to bring phones to school might be a trouble of some students. The reason why is because they use their phone to communicate with their parents or family members. If parents don't have a way to call their children after school to get picked up, or if something bad has happened would lead up to using the school phone just to ask any parents for a little question. It would be better just to let them have a phone so that this situation would not happen.

My main reasons to agree with policy one is that with that policy students at your school will have more respect for you just so you would let them use their phone at school. If this policy passes i think students will probably come down a little bit and they will actually like the school even more. They would tell their family and friends of the school soon a large amount of people would want to sign up in your school. These are the reason why i agree with policy one.

It makes me feel that the person doesn't really care about what I'm going to say, like my input doesn't matter. I do not think cell phones should be included in an ideal learning environment.

Cell phones are a distraction. I've seen so many people slide out their cell phone and text or play a game while a teacher is talking. Not only is it affecting your grade, but also is very rude. It is equivalent to asking someone a question and walking away while their talking. The teacher is there to help but the person simply ignores them. School is a place where you are supposed to engage and learn, not a place to play.

I've witnessed cheating before. I've seen someone walk out of the classroom texting answers to a friend. I've seen people use their cell phones to research test questions. Cell phones are for communicating. Unfortunately, people may misuse technology to cheat. Sometimes a student will whine to the teacher about having a cell phone stolen. That is one of the risks of bringing a phone to school.

Cell phones are great for communication. You could call your mom or dad or your aunt or uncle or anyone else. Maybe you need to go home earlier because a club was canceled. You could just whip out your phone and problem solved even if it is in sixth period History. This is the solution.

516C0021B78F,"Dear Principal of middle school and high schools,

I am a fellow 8th grader, and i know for a fact, that... teenagers love their phones. Why take them away when the could actually need them at some point?

I think it is fair for them to use them during lunch and other free times, but they should be turned off during class time. I think Policy 1 you should consider.

Yes, it would be rather irritating having their phones on during class and trying to text message their friends, so you take them away?

I think you should just say if you are caught with a phone, to call your parents and have them come and take the cell phone.

Another reason that I believe that if their parents need to call them for an emergency, like if one of them got in a car crash or someone got sick, or had to go to the hospital, then they should have their cell phone. If their parents really need them though, they can just call the school, right? Not their child because they know they are most likely in class.

Some parents do not acknowledge that their kid is in class, and not to disrupt them.

So therefore, I think the teenagers should be able to check or use their cell phone in lunch or in free times.

In case they have an emergency or parents called them for an emergency. That's the only reason I think that they should use their cell phone.

Should the students text during class though?

Is it a NEED? For some students, it acts like a need.

Some kids just get out their phone during class and try to secretly text or look at their phone.

Most teachers have caught on when they see this kind of thing.

What students want to text each other during class?

That's right, most teenagers.

Texting during class should be a rule at school, to NOT text. It is rude and your not paying attention to the teacher and you may possibly start to do worse with your grades and school work. That's why I believe that Policy 1 you should consider because it will allow students to have their phones in school, but to turn them off during class.

You are allowed to use them during lunch and free times.

I believe that Policy 1 is a better cell phone policy.

The students will better enjoy school.

You may have to really enforce that they can't use their phones during class, because some students will sneak them.

So the teachers should really watch their students, when their looking down for no reason, and smiling.

Most likely they have their cell phone. Then some students just obey, and don't use their phone during class.

They may use them during lunch, and other free periods, or times.

Policy 1 is better for the school and the students sake.

I, a student of your school SCHOOL_NAME, advise you enforce policy 1. I believe this because lunch is supposed to be a free time where students can take a break from school work in order to be able to work for the rest of the day. Though sneaking cell phones in classrooms are an issue in this option. However, I have made a plan to prevent this.

Teachers can make students turn on alarms on their cell phones throughout the day so teachers can detect cell phones being on. You would also have to make them turn their cell phones to the maximum volume so teachers can hear if the students are turning them down. There is an issue of students turning off their cell phone alarms during free times, but teachers can check their cell phones after free times.

There is also another problem with students turning off the alarms during class, though there is a solution to that also. Teachers can patrol the classroom while teaching orally. They can also get a chalkboard with wheels and patrol while teaching with a chalkboard. Teachers will be able to see their cell phones being used.

That is why I believe you should enforce policy 2 instead of policy 1. All problems that are very effective can be eliminated with the ideas I have. The students will be able to do work and have a effective break.            ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I think we should be able to have cell phones in our school due to the fact that you can see that most 14 or 15 year olds have cell phones and other electronics and so that we wont have to sneak them in anyway, I mean come on this school gives out psps and ipods and other stuff to us so its like there daring us to bring them to school.

It is the 21st century new things are coming out all the time every one has a cell phone or ipod or something you would think that we would be able to take our electronics to school by now, also don't you see all that violence out there. IT is always the same thing all the time some crazy person goes to a somewhere and starts shooting up the place like columbine, Virginia tech, and more recently Arizona some one just started shooting the school right now we wouldn't be able to call the cops for help and then you would have yet another tragedy at your hands.

I think that Policy 1 would be a good policy to have because, if students were able to have their phones with them and be able to use their phones they wouldn't have their phones taken up as much during class, parents wouldn't complain to the school about their kid's phone, and kids would learn more. As a matter of fact, one time I was in the lunch room eating lunch, talking to friends, and texting my mom on my phone. Then a teacher comes up and tells me to give them my phone but I refused to and yelled at the teacher and told them I was talking to my mom about tutoring after school. The teacher still wound up taking away my phone, when I got home I told my mom, she called the school and complained to them about it all.

First of all, students would not have their phones taken up as much during class. For instance, the students can text their friends, family, and boyfriends or girlfriends during free time and wouldn't get into trouble and have their phone taken away. Plus they could also tell the people they are talking to when they had to go so they could text them later. Also, with students being allowed to have their phones out during free time they'll just have more time with their phone, which means they will just the more quickly die out on the thrill of having a phone. Then they will most likely have their phones with them gradually lesser and lesser.

Secondly, parents wouldn't be complaining about their kid's phone anymore. Just like the story i told you earlier about me texting my mom, and then my mom complaining to the school. With less phone calls to teachers and to the principal about the phones the teachers will have more time to do the work they have rather then deal with a phone problem. Also, with the complaint level going down over the phones stress in school teachers will go down a lot. So I think that the parents complaint levels lowering would be a very good thing.

Thirdly, kids would learn a lot more. I think this mostly because, the kids wouldn't be obsessed over trying so hard to text someone and they will actually learn something in class. An example for this topic is, I am not going to lie, there are some days when I just try to text and don't learn anything. I",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Many kids have cell phones these day, and you can't help the fact that they do. I agree that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as their phone are turned off during class time and other important times.

I feel this way because if kids are using them during free times and not during class they aren't hurting anything or anyone. It should be the student's choice to use it when they are not in class. I don't think teachers and other adult authorities have the right to tell us not to use our cell phones when we are not in class. Many kids may have to contact their parents for important issues, so using their cell phone when they aren't in class is a way to let kids communicate with their parents or guardians very easily, plus it is not effecting anyone when they do it.

Using cell phones during lunch and other free periods doesn't hurt anyone or anything. I strongly believe that until it starts to effect people, students should be allowed to use their cell phones in their free time at school.

More and more kids are starting to get cell phones and it's a fact. This is why I agree that students should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as their phones are turned off during class time and other important events.

I really thank that students should have there cell phones at school cause what if they went somewhere in the school that no one can hear him or see him and he got trap he can get his cell phone and call someone or send a text. I leave mines at home cause it might get stole on the other hand. I really want to have phones out at school but you need to have them out class cause it take you from your work. During your lunch or break you can have them out and text but can't talk on them.

We can have the teachers to take them up before they walk in the class that how you do not have to worry about who phone was ringing or who texting. We should make a rule for cell phone to be brought to school and make sure they are on silence so when the teacher hear them they can take them then but if its on silence and you are at lunch or break and they hear them they can't take them from you. Our principal need to let us bring phones to school so if we got an emergency on the bus or when we get home and no one is there we got our cell phone to call someone.

Teachers should ask peoples to put there phones in a box with there names on it so when class is over with she would pass them back out. I had my phone took up before cause the teacher caught me with it. But if we had the cell phone rule i will have my phone right now but i got a new phone now and i'm not going to bring it to school until they say we can have phones out at school then everybody will bring there phones to school. My principal might let us have them cause his is a nice man and he know that some people walks around know with there cell phone if he see them he will tell you to put it up or if that's you second time he have told you he will be like bring it here or hand it to me and come with me to my office.

i just wish that they let us have them out at school so i can start bringing mine to school. So if you are reading this principal please let us have our cell phones out at school and just make a couple of rule so we won't just be doing anything when we have them out.

Cell phones are an important thing in today's world.

Most people have one.

While cell phones can be distracting, they are also very helpful.

Since you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy, I believe that the best possible policy is Policy 1.

Students should be able to have their cell phones in their free time at school.

Students sometimes need to be in contact with someone over something important.

They also could desire talking to their friends with their cell phones.

They could even if bored, just play games on their phone.

Those are some examples why cell phones should be aloud in free time at school.

Cell phones can be a bad thing at schools though, because they can get very distracting.

Recently, there have been many accidents due to people being distracted by cell phones.

Some examples of these accidents are people walking into things and many car accidents, all caused from someone being distracted by a cell phone.

It is even said that when a driver is distracted by a cell phone, it is worse the driving under the influence.

While cell phones are good, they can be very distracting.

If cell phones are used properly and at the proper times while at school, they should be fine.

If a student is caught using their cell phone in class, their teacher could just take it up for the rest of the class.

The only reason a student should be allowed to use it during class is in an emergency.

Otherwise, using a cell phone in class would be unacceptable.

Though cell phones can be bad, I still believe that they are more good than they are bad.

It is important to keep in touch with people.

If you don't see a friend at school, you could call them and meet up at lunch.

Policy 1 would be the best policy, and the more popular out of the two.

I think that you should allow students to use their cell pones during their lunch and free time only.

I think this because kids work hard in school and should have a reward for that not just by receiving good grades.

Also, cell phones are how we can communicate with our friends and family.

If there is an emergency, how else would we know that if our cell phones are turned off during the day.

Another reason I think that kids should be able to have their cell phones during lunch and free time is because with our technology today, the cell phone is a major part of that and it can show us new ways to create things.

Someone in our school may be the next person to build a new innovation that can change the world and if we can experience technology at a young age then that can benefit us in the future.

Going back to my reason of why kids should be able to use their cell phone at school is because if we make good grades we want to be rewarded just like most people would but not just by grades.

If we can use our cell phones during free time that can also give us a chance to relax our brain and give it a chance to rest before going back to work again. This can be a reward for everyone.

If its our free time then we should be able to spend it the way we want it for the most part, so why not on our cell phone?

Also, if we have a family emergency how else would we know, especially if we are at school? Our parents would probably call or text us, but if we can't look at our cell phones or if they are turned off then how soon will it be before we can look and see?

I understand that some kids well take advantage of this new policy and that we happen we can't say that it won't, but that is what's going to happen with every situation.

We just have to make sure that doesn't happen to many students.

If they decide to use the privilege unwisely then they should be punished like every other person.

We can't make everyone perfect so we just have to help and fix the flaws that will come with this policy.

I think that this new policy will improve students grades because when they go back to a class they will have a more relaxed mind.

Also, they will have to make good decisions during free time on how to use it rationally.

If they decide to use it irrationally, then they have to face the consequence of their actions.

This will also make the students feel more grown up, mature, and responsible because they have to make choices for themselves.

This prepares them for the real world ahead of them.

In my opinion, this is the policy that we should take on as our own. I think this will benefit multiple people in our scenario, not just the kids, or not just the teachers.

break and text all they want without having to hide their cell phones they will feel good and so will parents! they will have better grades in class and that's what SCHOOL_NAME wants right. there will probably be more and more students every year. this school will probably be popular and students will have found the right school. the one they fit right in.

I believe that the cell phone policy should be changed for the better. That is why I believe that 'Policy 1' would be the best for students. I also believe it would be an advantage to guardians as well. Continue reading to learn why.

Scenario 1:

During lunch, you remember you forgot your math homework, and you can't have three missing assignments. But you also know the teacher won't let you call your guardian. So if we had 'Policy 1' the you would take out your cell phone, call your guardian, and get your homework! you're happy because the teachers THRILLED you don't have three missing assignments!

Scenario 2:

Now do this. You're at lunch, when you remember you forgot your math homework , and you can't have three missing assignments. But you also know the teacher won't let you call your guardian. So if we had 'Policy 2', you'd run up to the teacher at the podium; and ask to call your guardian. Then, the unthinkable! He say's ""No."" Now you're in of class, teacher asks to see your homework. You reply. ""I left it at home."" and you get slapped with a detention!

See how the detention, and the humiliation could have been avoided. Now it reflects poorly on the school, because now the student has a bad grade. Something that I believe could have been avoided, but only if we accept 'Policy 1'. But if not, those scenario's, and ones like it will continue to happen. And to take it's effect on our school. Something no one wants to happen!

Now a guardian needs to call a kid to tell them to ride the bus, not wait to be picked up. They could call the office, but I work at the office, and I know how something's get messed up in translation! So the parent calls the student at lunch time.

Student's happy, guardian's happy, school's happy! Now why wouldn't we want the guardian, AND the kid, AND the school to be happy?

I believe we should have policy one , this is why, Policy one seems fair enough for everyone because it allows you to use your phone at lunch and free periods (passing period) and some students might need to use their phone in case of an emergency. Some students use phones anyways when it is not even allowed on the campus. In my opinion kids should be able to use phones as long as it is on vibrate or silent and they cant disrupt other kids or play music. I think they can use it in classes for a calculator or a timer, etc. Policy two you cant even use the phone at all. I think each school that's thinking of having phones should do a vote with the parents and students, and have students write an essay on why they should have phones and if twenty out of one hundred students have a convincing essay about phones then they should be able to have there phones during lunch and passing periods. If this rule is abused then we get one warning then another warning and finally just not be able to have phone at all the third time you tell us to not have phones out during class. A lot of kids don't follow the rules at school but maybe if you let them have the privilege of having their phones they will end up becoming more responsible. I hope that we will be able to use phones at school and if we aren't able to have the phones at school right now than at least consider it later in the years. In my opinion and other kids opinions we believe that we should be able to have our phone during school. Its something to think very hard about but what ever you choose people will respect your decision and maybe you'll even consider it later on when other kids are there and you are still the principal.

I think that they should be aloud for only lunch periods and free time. Advisory would be the only free time we really have during the day. I know the teachers think we will abuse the opportunity to use our cell phones. I think if you have it on silent and you don't mess with it in class unless it is and absolute emergency then it is fine. If you want to use it in advisory or during lunch then i don't see the big deal.

My personal opinion is the cell phone issue is blown way out of per portion. If the kid wants to check their phone really quick then let them do it. Its not like they have their ring tone blaring or anything. Teachers all know that we remember to put them on silent. Maybe if a student had the permission to use their phone in school from their parent. The teachers don't allow it but their guardian does. I think the issue should be resolved by parents and not by a student.

For one no one listens to us. They think were just a teenager looking for an excuse to use out phones. Well its not because maybe some kids like to feel safe with their phone. Its like their security to let them know their safe. Maybe their being bullied and want to talk to someone about it. And they don't want to bring the principal into it all.

They can text their mom or dad and resolve the issue. I think it is important to talk to them. Some kids have anger issues and can only be calmed down by loved ones. Only they can reach you.

Well i have expressed my opinion on the Cell Phone Policy and now it is up the school. And i hope you go back and read the story clear because their are reasonable explanations for the reasons for cell phone use.

I think it's a really good idea of letting us use our phones during lunch periods and other free time. I think it's a good idea because where stuck in class waiting and sitting and staring at boring text books doing work. I also believe we students should deserve some kind of free time for our selves to enjoy on our cell phones. Also it's a good way for us to take stuff off our mind like getting a bad grade on a assignment. it would be a good idea to put our cell phones on silence for the teachers wont get irritated like they usually do.

I think policy one is the best choice for our school. Policy two wouldn't be such a great policy for our school because considering the fact that we wont have phones at school at all is more torture for us students during free times, lunch, and during periods.

Should cell phones be allowed in school?

Dear Principal,

I know you are considering to whether or not to allow cell phones in school. Well I have some suggestions on why we should be allowed. First of all, mostly what is thought about for the purpose of cell phones is just to talk and text. Though, the real purpose on why we were given cell phones in the first place at all was for emergencies. I think we should be allowed to have or use cell phones in school during lunch or free periods is because we might have an emergency to deal with, sometimes we just want to talk and hang with friends, and/or we have to contact our parents on where we are, with whom, and if or if not we will be at home or somewhere else.

The most important reason I think we should be allowed to have cell phones in school is for dealing with emergencies. Let's just say something very unfortunate happens like a loved one has passed away, you have to be contacted immediately in order to know because our parents may not be able to reach us or pick us up because of such misfortune. Also, maybe your parents are stuck at work so they need to call you to get a carpool because they know they won't be able to pick you up from school.

Another reason I see fit for allowing us to use cell phones, is because sometimes we students like to relax and just hang or talk with friends. Some friends might not have any classes together especially in middle school and high school since our schedules are different most of the time. So, we want to talk to them at every chance we get but since they might be going somewhere you may not be able to communicate personally so that's where the cell phones come in.

Lastly, we should be allowed to use our cell phones because may be we need to call or contact our parents on our whereabouts. Such as, maybe you are going to go over to a friends house to work on homework, a project, etc. Also, to tell our parents maybe we're going to be a little late coming home because of an after school class, club, or tutoring session.

So in conclusion, if you can kindly so review or consider some of my ideas on allowing cell phones I and the student body would really appreciate it. You never know what might come up so it's good to have such a device with you at times. After all, we students might need it for emergencies, to contact our parents on our whereabouts, or sometimes just to talk to friends.

I think cell phones are an issue in school because sometimes there doesn't seem to be all that much learning going on. I believe that our school should use Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all. Students come to school to learn, not fiddle around with their phones.

Cell phones are just too distracting. While they are useful at times, like calling a parent after school or for emergencies, students shouldn't be messing around with them all the time. If kids were allowed to have phones they would be texting a friend in study hall, instead of using that time to be doing homework or studying. Plus not all students would follow that rule- some would be texting in class to their buddy who is in lunch or something. Imagine all the trouble it would cause. How are we to learn anything with the distraction of cell phones?

So even though cell phones prove useful at times, they can also be a problem and ruin our learning environment. So, which shall it be? Cell phones? No cell phones?

My opinion would have to be Policy 2 because you are at school to learn for a better education and not to be texting your friends during lunch because probably four fifths of your friends are all ready at school and why would you want to text them if you are sitting by them. Another reason is that if you give kids an opportunity to text during lunch then they would take advantage of texting and they would text during the school day and not pay attention in class. If it was my opinion I would not have cell phones in my pocket so i can call my mom when i get to school otherwise you do not need your phone to text during school hours.

C8F0F3C12D4A,"Dear Principal,

I understand that you may not like cell-phones being used in our school but the only problem with them is that they are a distraction to the learning process. As long as we do not use them during class time but only during free time such as free periods or lunch then I don't think that they are a problem.

My first reason is that almost everybody does some sort of after school activity whether they are sports or clubs or anything else. These things are constantly getting canceled and rescheduled. Students need to inform there parents if they have practice and what time their parents need to pick them up at. For example I planned on staying after school to watch the school basketball game. On the announcements I was informed that this was cancelled. My mother was coming right from work to pick me up. I had to inform her at lunch or she would have left work early and have been waiting for me. During lunch I informed her with my cell-phone and the problem was resolved but if you do not allow us to use our cell-phones then this could turn into a real issue.

My second reason is that cell-phones are bad because they are a distraction. If we are only using them when we are not learning then how can they be a distraction. At home sometimes I text when i am doing my homework and this really distracts me and I can't get my homework done so I stopped.

During class I totally agree that cell-phones are nothing but a nuisance to teachers so they should be turned off so students can learn. When we are not learning then cell-phones aren't always bad because we are having fun, getting something accomplished even if it is the littlest thing and there is no way they can distract us if we are not doing anything anyway.

People have some pretty stupid stereotypes for why cell-phones bad but most of these aren't even true. For example when someone says ""Cell Phones are a waste of time"", they are wrong because you might be asking a friend what the homework was or you may be planning a trip to Brazil to learn about the creatures in the rainforest. I am begging you not to completely ban cell-phones because this will cause an uproar of people banging on your door because you banned cell-phones without any hard evidence. If you go out and take a survey of all the students and they say ban cell-phones then I will be okay, but I am positive that what the student body at are school wants is to continue to use cell phones during class time because it is not disrupting the learning process.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I think your first policy is better because then maybe student will know not to use there phones in class when you gave them the privilege to use it during free time and at lunch. Also if you tell them they can only use it during free time and lunch the might like it because at least they are using there phones in school. Maybe it will help them focus more giving them an opportunity to use there phone in school. If you chose policy 2 that will get kids upset and make them want to use there phones in school even more. Like people say if you tell kids not to do something the still do. So policy 1 is better because by letting them use there phones in school them might have the scenes not to use there phones in class because the don't want to lose the privilege of using there phones in school. It will make kind understand that they are given an opportunity to have some free time to use there phones and they wouldn't want to mess that up. If kind don't listen and start using there phones in class again then that's when you cant enforce policy 2, but some kind wont listen.

In my own opinion based on things I've seen in school, I think it would be best if students are able to bring and use their phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times as long as it's turned off during class time. My reasoning for this is that students will be able to have a means of communication in case of an emergency at the school such as an earthquake or lockdown. Even though the teachers would have heir cell phones to help the students during this time, it doesn't hurt to be safe. Some students walk home where teachers are not available and may be involved unintentionally in badly times incidents. However the downside to this policy is some that students may disobey this rule and use their phones during class time to cheat or share answers with others as some students have phones with and internet connection nowadays due to the popular demand of smart phones which most likely comes with internet access. . So this policy has its share of disadvantages along with advantages.

Comparing the first policy to the second, the second policy about not having any phones in the school has at least one advantage. Schools who do not allow students to bring phones to school will probably a lower cheating percentage and no more confiscation. Then again with the students who follow the rules, there are the students who have nothing better to do but break, disobey, defy the school policies just because they wither want to show off that they can do it, are arrogant and think that they can do whatever they want, or rebelling in some cases. or just want to tick off the teacher for laughs and giggles.

Personally I think that the first policy would be the best for our school as I don't see many disadvantages to it. Students would be able to find each other if they split up, alert others of any school changes ahead of time, notify others about things their teacher changes in their classroom, or remind their classmates not to forget about supplies. They'd also have a means of communication in times of an emergency. The only advantage I see for not letting students have phones at school at all is that less people would most likely cheat on tests and they'd pay more attention in class rather than text one another in their own conversation. So personally I think the first policy has more benefits than the second policy.

I have been thinking about cell phones and why we should have them at school. You should allow students to bring their phones to school and let us only use them during lunch and other free times and then make us turn them off during class time. This could get a little worry off our shoulders, just a little bit. But for now here are some reasons you should let us have cell phones at school.

The first reason is about having them out during free time. Having them out at free time and lunch gives us a little more freedom, I think. We can get what every we needed done with our phones at those times and not in class bothering you and the teachers. This will let us ask our friend something that is in another room easier because then we are not asking to go here or there, disturbing others. This was one reason why we should have phones out in school.

My next reason is getting worries off our shoulders. By getting thing off our shoulders is if we left something at home for example we can text or call our family to bring it to the school for us and that will help us get our things to the teacher in time. Another example is if we are not feeling good we can call someone to come get us also.

Principal please think things over if you can and consider changing the schools policy to this. Hope that you will change it to this policy and so will everyone else. Everyone in the school will thank you for what you did if u do consider. So thank you and have a nice day.

465FAD6FEDC4,"I think that the principal should choose Policy 2.

I think this because, cell phones distract students at school, and without them, students would have all of their focus on their school work, and therefore, get better grades.

Also, cell phones are bad, because through them, students could get cyber-bullied, and people become less social, and communicate more through their phones, and via text message, than actual face to face, which is far more important.

Having no cell phones would mean that people would be focused more on their school work and all that jazz, rather than on their texts, and things like gossip, rumors, etc.

However, allowing the students to use their cell phones, would boost their morale, and make them happier, but it is not as good a trade, cell phones, and better grades.

Policy 1 may only allow them at lunch, and other free times, but that won't stop some students from using them whenever they want, and abusing their liberty.

Even with Policy 2, which is in use by my school, is disobeyed, and cell phones are still used, despite.

Therefore, it would be best to choose Policy 1, so as to not apply a distraction to the school day, and allow students to be more social face-to-face, rather than through technology.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I am writing this letter, to help choose which policy would be best for the school. I think that the first policy would be a better choice. Some kids have overprotective parents and they need a phone to let them know where they are or something. Also, what if on their way home something very bad happens; fall and can't get up, lost, hit by a car, robbed or many other possible things, they would need to inform their parent or guardian right away. Another reason i chose that policy is because either way kids are going to bring a phone, and because of that there would be a lot of confiscations. To avoid having parents come to school and pick up their kids phones, you should just allow kids to use their phones on free times. If every school had this policy there would be no reason to text during class since all kids would know they have free time in a couple minutes. That is why i think we should have policy 2.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

The school's cell phone policy should indeed be changed from the original policy to Policy 1. Children are stubborn, but nobody likes getting into trouble at school. Letting students use their cell phones during passing periods or lunch will give them a better attitude during their classes and one less thing they could get into trouble because of.

Some kids have significant others or close friends at other schools. The children in that category enjoy speaking with the people more meaningful to them even if it is during school hours. These people most likely put them in a better mood, so their attitude is to be expected to improve. With a better attitude during class will also improve students participation levels and grades.

Most kids get into trouble often for texting in class, but who wants to be in trouble? Kids from the junior high level to high school level will in fact bring their cell phones into school whether it is against the rules or not. Not every kid in America loves going to school and learning, so the children who don't, try to escape from class without exiting the room.

A1E4631053F4,"Dear Principal,

I think we should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school because they will be turned off in school periods, we should be able to use them during lunch periods and free time, and also during important events.

My first reason why we should be able to bring our cell phones to school because they will be turned off. They won't be a big distraction in class. Teachers wouldn't be able to tell if we had our cell phones or not because they would be turned off during class periods. either they would be turned off or on vibrate. So the teacher wouldn't notice if we did have our cell phones or not.

My second reason why we should have bring our cell phones to school is because when we do have lunch or free time at school we should be able to use them then but when lunch time and free periods are over we are going to put them up immediately. But while we are at lunch we should have time to text friends or catch up with others or the ones that weren't at school that day tell them what they missed or what they had to make up that day or the day they come back. We should also have our phones at school because what if we have an emergency and we have to call home to our parents and tell them.

Finally, my third reason why we should be able to bring our phones to school is because when we do have important events. Our cell phones would be turned off and wouldn't be a big mess up when it does go off they wouldn't have to stop and tell us to turn the phone off and tell us to leave cause the phone would already be turned off and wouldn't be a big mess up.

In my conclusion, these are my reasons why would should bring our phones to school because they would be off in class periods, we should be able to bring them during lunch periods and free time, and they would be turned off in important events. I mean children would bring their phones anyway if they wanted to or not. They think it's their phone they can bring it so the principal should let us bring them to school no matter if they are on or off. Students are able to bring their phones either if there on or off they could be silent or on vibrate it wouldn't matter to a student.

I think that we should have policy 1. Because some kids actually know how to respect the policy and keep their phones away during class, and some kids don't. but why else would discipline be invented? if their cell phones are out during class, the teachers can just take them away; and if that doesn't help, then you call the parents; and I'm pretty sure they'll deal with that!

So, policy 1 really caught my attention; i mean, if kids are using it during classes, cant the teachers just take them away as discipline? Kids would really learn their lesson if they get it taken away. I hear my friends talk about it all the time... Like ""Oh my goodness Ashley, my phone got taken away by the teacher! I'm going to be in so much trouble if my mom finds out!"" And the only thing I tell them is, ""maybe next time you should think about that, huh?"" They get mad at me but whatever. Ha-ha, oh well! It's only the truth! If you take their phones away! That's like torcher to them!!!

Let's see, if you have a school policy that you can have phones on free time or at lunch! Wow; our school would be known as the coolest school ever! Maybe not the coolest, but we would be known as a very good school. Everyone always complains about how we don't have any freedom, i think every school does. But our school would be very known; and i can promise you EVERYONE would be talking. I mean, you already complain enough about how our school is known for bad things; if you have policy one, people would think that we achieved all of the goals that were set for our school, that we have good students. All that kind of stuff. Isn't that what you wanted our school to look like? To be like? I remember you telling out whole school you that you wanted us to be known as a good community? I think that'd be amazing! cause it's way better then how we look right now!

Now, if people are taking advantage of policy 1, you can deal with that by calling their parents. Some student's are VERY scarred of their parents sometimes. AND even if it gets to the point where it's really bad; then you can call the police for a meeting, or even to take away the phone during the whole school year! I know if i was in that situation, i'd be balling my eyes out! i would be so upset, it wouldn't be funny at all! I'd probably go through a depression! hah, but seriously; some kids are like, ADDICTED to their phone! Kind of like me! (;

So, i hope this letter help you figure out what policy you're going to have, cause i mean come on; I'm pretty sure if you asked the whole school to do a letter about it; i'm 90% sure, they'd all agree with me!(:

Policy #1

Dear, Principal

The policy I believe is best for the student of are school is policy #1.

I think this because students should have more free time, and should be allowed to bring and to use cell phone during time out of class.

There is one that I disagree on in policy #1 is that student should not have to turn there phones of during time in class. I think this because phones such as iphones today are common to mostly all people. People should be allowed to use there phone for school work. Such as researching something for social studies.

All though student should have to turn cell phone off and put in a basket owned by the teacher during a test or a work sheet that is a important grade, and after the test or grade paper the student should be able to get there phone back. This should be done cause student will text the answers to other class mates.

In my opinion, student should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. Students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch and free times because it can help them communicate with their parents and other peers.

Students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch because it could help them find their friends on the large school campus. Sometimes, when you don't know what class your friend has before lunch it is hard to finds them, and by having a cell phone you can call them and find them easily. Also, during lunch some students would want to call their parents to ask if they are bringing them a lunch, or if they should buy a school lunch. Students may also want to ask their parents if they can go to a friends house after school, and so they will not need to pick them up.

Having a cell phone would also help communication between students and friends from other schools, and between students and friends who are elsewhere on the campus. Students could call their friends to get help on homework or other school projects, or to plan what they are doing after school. Another reason why students should be able to have their cell phones on during free periods in school is because some students, if allowed, leave the campus to eat lunch, and their peers may be wondering where they are, when they are coming back, or to alert them that class has already started.

By not letting students have their cell phones in school, they would be unable to communicate with their parents or peers. The school staff may be worried that students may use their cell phones during class, but if students are allowed to use them in their free times they most likely will not use them while they are learning. Teachers are afraid that students secretly use their cell phones during class, and that it takes away from their education. However, if a student is caught using their cell phone during learning time they know it could be confiscated for the rest of the day.

Many students use their phones after school to contact their parents, friends, or carpool. Many times parents are late to pick their kids up, and if the kids have their cell phones they can call them to make sure they remember where they are. Students also use their cell phones after school to call their friends and ask if they want to hang out or go somewhere now that school ended.

In conclusion, students should be able to bring phones to school and only use them during lunch or other free periods, because it makes communicating easier. As long as cell phones are turned off and not used in class, they will not be a disturbance to the students learning and education.

DDC53C7B5B42,"My opinion on using cell phones at school is positive. I think that phones should at school because it is needed for kids to call their parents to pick them up after school. Another reason is because what if one day a student finds somebody that needs help and need to call the ambulance. That student could save that persons life I say that for experience. Also in any type of emergencies like when your guardian or your friend, neighbor etc drop you of and forget something they could just call you so the guardian doesn't have to stop where their going and go all the way to the office to give them your stuff. Also the students would to check on their family when somebody is sick.

I think you should consider enforcing policy number 1. Policy number one is better for the school because if you would just let kids use their cell phones and other electronics, more students would probably pay more attention in class.

Instead of trying to text their friends in class because they cant text them at nutrition or lunch, or trying to listen to their IPODS because they can listen to it at nutrition or lunch, if you enforce policy number 1.

If us as students realize the rules your making are sort of unfair because sometimes teachers use their phone in and out of class and we don't get to use our cell phones (that's a little hypocritical), and if we think the rules are unfair were obviously not going to listen to them and make our own rules and have or make our own freedom.

So i ask as a fellow student , as an eighth grader for you to choose policy number 1, because if you choose policy number more students will pay more attention in class, learn more, get better grades, also as eighth graders you will have helped us make our last year here way better than it was going to be, and would have given us our freedom, and your trust.

Dear Principal,

I think that you should let students bring phones to school and use them during free times. One of the most important reasons why students should be able to bring their phones to school is if they miss their bus and they have to contact a parent or guardian. Or if they are involved in any after school activities like sports or clubs they would have to contact someone to get them when what ever they are doing is over. They are also great to have if there was ever an emergency. A good reason for letting them use their phones during free periods is they could find where their friend is and sit together. Or they could ask each other homework questions and help each other. Those are just some of the many reasons why students should be aloud to have their cell phones with them.

Here at SCHOOL_NAME we have a strict policy about cell phone usage. Some other schools don't stick to that rule as well as we do and you may think that is a problem, but not me. Personally I feel that we (the students) should be allowed to carry our cell phones around and to school if we use them wisely. We should be allowed to use them during passing breaks and at lunch because that will and does not affect our learning.

I see why this rule was so strictly enforced as well because some students could abuse this and bring their phones into class. Just having it in class wouldn't be that bad either but some students may try and use them. Which is why i think the rule of having phones be turned off while in class is the perfect solution. But if the students ever try to abuse that ability of having it with them, then the teachers just need to put their foot down and maybe even give punishments to the students who don't choose to follow their rules.

Some kids only got their cell phones so that their parents could contact them when needed. If students weren't allowed to have their phones then the parents may not be able to reach them when needed. We could check our phones during passing breaks to see if anyone had called or messaged us. Our parents would be happy with this because then we could tell them what they needed or just answer back.

Mostly all the kids here are very mature and I feel would be able to use this privilege in the best way possible. I have never been giving the chance to try, but I know we wouldn't let you down. If you would please consider what I said and let the students of your school, SCHOOL_NAME, have a chance to prove to you how good this can be.

Most students have good grades and a cell phone.

The students at our school like to be on their cell phones.

If you were to let them use their phones during lunch and the free times it would cut back on how many kids get in trouble for talking or texting their friends.

Allowing the students to use their phones during free times might keep them more focused during class.

Being focused in class is a problem for many teens because of their cell phones.

They are too worried about what is going on outside of the classroom and not worried about what is on the board.

Letting the students use their phones during free periods and lunch would let them be more focused in class because they would know what was going on outside of school.

Students would also be less tempted to use their phones during class because they just got time to use them during their free period.

If the students aren't using their phones during class there is a better chance that they will be paying attention and using their time more wisely.

During a normal school day many kids get in trouble for using their phone in class or in the hallway.

Their phone would be taken up and they would have to go to the office and call their parents to come get the phone.

If the teenagers were allowed to use their phones during lunch and free times the number of kids in trouble would reduce by a great number.

they wouldn't be as tempted to use their phone in class and the teacher wouldn't have to worry about catching a teenager using their cell phone during the school day.

The kids wouldn't get in trouble and their parents wouldn't have to worry about their kid getting in trouble for using their phone during the day.

The students would also be happier because they have been trusted and given more freedom to use their cell phones.

In the end teenagers should be trusted to use their cell phones during free periods and lunch. It would make the working environment more pleasant and the students would pay attention and learn more.

Everyone would feel more accomplished and happier about the work effort and participation from the students.

I honestly think that you should consider having policy #1. Students would love to have their cell phones with them during school hours. They should be able to use them during snack, lunch, before school, and after school. However, you should make a strict policy about using cell phones during class time. students should not be allowed to use their cell phones during class for these reasons: they wouldn't pay attention to the teacher anymore which would make their grades drop, they would keep texting and they wouldn't be focused on the lesson at all, and if everybody's grades start dropping the next generation would not have money at all. However, there is nothing wrong with them having their cell phone with them during snack and lunch. Some people don't have friends and at snack and lunch they sit alone and do not know what to do. if you give students a chance to have their cell phones with them during snack and lunch they at least have their cell phone with them and play games on it or listen to music. Students would also be able to communicate with their parents if they need something. For example if someone forgot their book at home but really needs it for the next class; they would call their mom or dad during snack or the five minute passing time and they would bring it to school. But if you don't have your cell phone with you then you would get an F for just forgetting something at home. If you let them have their cell phones and they cross the line like using it in class and getting in trouble too much because of it, remember, you can always go back to having no cell phones in school; but I think that you should try it and see what happens.

If kids were given the right to have phones at school all the time, I am almost positive that they would not only use them during lunch and other free periods, but whenever they wanted to. They would listen to music and text friends that are in a different school or in a different room. This would cause them to get into trouble and also the person that they are texting would get into trouble.

Having no phones at all is the best policy because without them there is less of a chance for you to get into trouble and having it taken away from you. There are less distractions and more time to focus on school work without a cell phone.

I believe the policy of allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time is a good policy. I think this for many reasons, like if there was an emergency at school, or if they need something brought in from home, and lastly to let parents know of cancellations without having to use the schools phone.

My first reason was that if there was an emergency at school, like a fire or any other emergency that could happen during the school day. Students would then be able to let their parents know they are safe. If other emergencies would happen, the students would be able to call police or anything else that might need done that adults might not be able to get to.

My second reason is that if the students need something brought in from home, many students forget things and don't want to bother asking to use the schools phone. It would create less hassle for the school, and make it easier for the students.

My third and final reason why students should be aloud to bring phones to school is because parents would need to know about cancellations of any after school activities, So they knew their children were at home and not a practice so they wouldn't have to get them at school.

Policy 1 is better for kids with cell phones then they can use them in free time and lunch. One thing about both policy's is that kids will use there cell phones when they are not supposed to . So either way it may be bad but i think policy 1 is better.

In policy one it allows students to use their cell phones during free time. That is a good idea. Many students would like that better than not at all. I am sure that many kids would be mad and think it will still be okay to use them so they will. but if you let them in their free time they will not care. That's the plan I would use.

But there are some bad things about policy one is that many kids will use them in class. But if you give them a warning they may stop. But some kids wont so you confiscate it form them. Then when they get it back they will not do it again. But most kids wont because they do not want it to be confiscated. That's is a good reason to confiscate cell phones if they have them out in class.

But policy 2 wont matter to some people because they do not have cell phones. But since they don't have cell phones they don't care about it like kids with cell phones. That's why I like policy 1 . I have a cell phone so I know that I wouldn't like policy 2 just like other kids with cell phones. That's another reason policy 1 is better.

Letting students bring cell phones to school is a choose of freedom towards the children

Policy one sounds like a pretty good idea. Student using their phones during any free time, though having them turned off during class. It is clear to the student of these rules, though if the problem is that someone is using their phones during class, a more suitable punishment would be to take their phone away like most teachers do.

Having cell phones completely forbidden from school may not be the smartest choice of all. Some students must call their parents when they get to school from walking or riding the bus so that the parent may know if their okay. Also, some students, such as myself, need to call their parents when they get out of school, to know that their child is alright and is ready to get picked up, or to even know if their parents are going to pick them up or that they must go walking.

Phones can be a hazard if they are not under the correct use or are not being followed by the rules. Yet, with the maturity level of the students, I'm pretty sure as young adults they will do what they are told.

Phones should be accepted in school, the only reason some people may think they shouldn't be allowed, is probably for disturbance of the class. But, do you believe a student can respect the rules? Of course they can!!!

I believe this because cell phones are only objects we don't need to have we just want to. I wont lie i love my cell phone and like to talk and text to my friends all the time but I think that we should have a limit to how much use we get out of them. If we bring them to school it will only increase the amount of people who just slack off and don't do work. My father told me that having a cell phone is a privilege not a given right that everyone has. I know that there's already so many bad things happening in school like bullying and people breaking the rules but i know what is right and what is wrong. People in school who just do whatever they want and don't expect anything to happen to them never win. I see tons of people in my school all the time with cell phones and there not supposed to have them but they still do. If we allow kids to have cell phones in school they will become lazy in there work and not try they will start thinking they are above the rules and above punishment. I stand on the ground that technology will corrupt people if we don't set guild lines for it. I know that since we have gotten more sophisticated technology kids are getting more and more lazy and mean. I know that not all technology is bad but i think we can do without some of it. I think if we had harsher rules and better morals kids would be a lot better than we are now. Our parents are teaching us the things that we need to know but they had much stricter lives than us and if we don't listen how can we learn. We have so many bad influences in our life time like TV stars and rock stars that we try and idolize and they usually end up making bad choices so if we try to be like them we will to. In our society we are cruel we judge people solely on looks and talent and if they have neither they are unfairly ridiculed. I think if we took the time to understand people we could all get along.

Even if you do not make that a policy we will text during lunch and class anyway so either way where still texting it's a wining situation for us that is but not so much for you a very good time to let us text would be in the morning during tag because we don't do anything in tag anyway except for Tuesday Wednesday and Thursdays.

But still we have Monday and Friday to text in tag but we should get to text during lunch everyday because all we do is eat and talk anyways and that's my final decision to the policy.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

I believe that the policy one is better because students bring their phones to school to communicate with their parents. Students also bring their phones to school to let their parents know if they need to be picked up from school or if they need to stay later with a teacher. Allowing students to bring their phones to school is also helping parents because they will know if they need to pick up their child or not and they will know what their child is doing. I believe if you allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times they are less likely to be using them during class time. Allowing students to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times will give them some freedom and will result in them being happy. With policy two and not allowing them to have their phones at school at all is not a good policy because students will not be able to communicate with their parents to let them know if they need to be picked up or if they need to stay after school with a teacher. By allowing students to bring their phones to school there is a chance for them to disobey and use them during class time without the teacher being aware. As a punishment for using their phones during class time without permission, the students phone should be taken away for a period of time. After that period of time is up the parents should have to come and get the phone. I believe a punishment like this should have the students think twice about using their phone during class time. If students are allowed to use their phones during lunch periods and free time I don't think they would try to use their phones during class time because they already know when they can use it so they don't want to get it taken away before their free time.

I think you should go with policy number 1. Because it might help kids do better in school. Some kids bring cell phones too school because they need them, to call there mom or for an emergency. You never know this days.

I do agree with policy number 1 because having kids have there phone off in class is good. Having kids have the phones on when its lunch time or free time is good.

But not having phone at all in school don't you think have a little unfair didn't you want cell phones allowed in your school when you went to school. If you did then this can be you time to change it. You can make the rules the way you wanted when you were a kid and having cell phone in school you can change that don't follow some other people opinion This is your school Have it the way you want it. But if you didn't want cell phones in you school when you were a kid well all i got to say about this.... are you crazy woman. Sorry about that but i really think you should allow cell phone in school. I think it will make alot of student happy and maybe even some teacher too. You never know these days.

The two policies are both important to the future of this school. Although that might be, policy two is much better for many reasons. policy two will allow the children in school to be able to contact there parents at any time in case of an emergency. Additionally this will insure that the students will always be in touch with family or friends during school hours so that they know they can get a hold of them at any time during the school day. When a parents need to let there children know something they can always let them know. This will be better because that will enforce to the children that they will know of any emergencies or change of plans at home. On the other hand, cell phones not allowed in class is good. This does make sure the students do not text or call during class. They need to be learning and paying attention so they will be smart and go to college and have a great successful life. This will be good for the children to be able to be in contact with individuals out side of the school area and yet still be learning and getting a higher education. Therefore, policy two will be more efficient to the children and to this school.

I've heard of the new cell phone policies, one where we get to use our phones during lunch and free time, or don't use our phones at all. I think policy 1 is better than policy 2, not just because I'm a student but because i think it's better. Policy 1 states: allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I think that sounds way better that not having phones at all. just think about it, what if something happens to a students mom and she cant take her son home, and if she tries to contact him, he wont be able to know because you chose policy 2. But if you chose policy 1, the student would call his mom back during lunch or free time and find out what happened. See, that makes policy 1 sound way better than policy 2. Now, what if their are some sneaky students and want to text in class? Well, tell the teachers to have a box and collect all of the student phones in the begging of class and return them back to the students at the end. It's that simple!

I think that allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are off or on silent during class time is a great idea because use kids be in school for a long time and sometimes we do get bored and off task but if we had our cell phone to living it up it would be much better as long as we can still come to class and get our work done.

But i also may think that its a bad idea because if more kids are being allowed to bring their cell phones to school that might cause more bullying and problems like phones getting lost, stole, broken and possibly taking when in class because students mite for get to turn it on silent or off before classes.

It also may be a very good idea because some penents don't allow their kids to take their cell phone to school because it is not allowed with in the building but if the children are allowed to use the phone with in some periods of the day. The perents will allow the kids to bring the phone to the school. So that the kids that walk to school can feel safe and protected. so that if something goes wrong like someone trying to take the child they can feel safe cause they will have their phone and the perents wont have to worry about if their child got to school safe or not.

Due to the recent fascination with cell phones and all the new technology, I can definitely see why you need the change in policy. You see, allowing cell phones as long as they are turned off for class and the ability to use them for free times, helps make a connection with your students. No one wants a principle that is too controlling, as in Policy 2, and you can't have students' cell phones ring all the time because it's distracting to the learning environment. That's why Policy 1 is a great compromise and a choice that benefits both sides.

If you did take cell phones away, you would create an awful tension between you and your students. People would be angry that one of their rights was taken away in a matter of seconds. What used to be acceptance would become anger and resistance. By banning cell phones you would make it seem as if bringing your cell phone would make you more of a rebel. Either way, this new policy would make students even more inclined to bring their cell phones.

Now let's say you picked Policy 1. People don't like change, but this time it isn't so big, which therefore means that people would be willing to accept it. By doing this you don't seem like a dictator and it's not pure chaos so this is an amazing choice that would create a bond of understanding. Not everyone is understanding as you may wish, but think of it as a life lesson for the students. Life isn't perfect. People just have to deal with that.

You may seem reluctant to this new age of technology and allowing cell phones but the truth is cell phones aren't all bad. I personally know many students that use there phone to get the homework assignments they missed or a calculator or even to check the time! When you are sick you need to call someone to get the homework. If you banned cell phones from school, it would take a lot longer to get the assignments. It's true that we also play games on our phones but it's to escape the shackles of society every once in a while.

Policy 1 is the best choice. It creates a compromise between your students that is fair. Students would agree that this is the best choice by far. Whether they like it or not, this is a choice and people will accept that. It's not to big of a difference either. People will adjust and life will go on. It's a choice that benefits both sides. These are the reasons you should pick Policy #1.

I think that policy 1 is a policy you could consider allowing us to use. Our cell phones being used during lunch and as long as we have our phones off during class. Because students should have a little freedom as long as we can be controlled. And it would be a privilege to be able to use them during lunch. Or may be you can let us use them on Fridays if we don't have any iss, referrals, or stuff like that. And maybe you can mix in both policy's but still give us a privilege to have some fun at the same time. You can also have it as a award as like when we do something good when you hand out those 200 tickets the award should be for that person to be able to use there electronics during lunch. i think the students in the campus would really like this idea.

But then again there is a down hill to this kids will not always follow these rules. So once these rules are broken that individual should not have the privilege to use his or hers electronics.

I consider that policy 1 is above par because of numerous reasons. Most students need their cell phone so their family and friends can contact them when needed. Some kids need their phone for the internet, like if their doing some kind of project that involves research then they'll need it. Most kids need to call their parents after school to let them know where their going to be after school, you never know what could happen.

Policy 2 is not the best choice because a lot of children are stubborn and not allowing phones to be on campus is just going to make them want to bring them even more.

As we all know you are reconsidering the schools cell phone policy.

The policy's that you are thinking of are A. Allow students to use cell phones during free times and lunch periods, and B. No cell phones at school at all.

I think that you should choose policy A.

I think you should choose policy A for 3 reasons.

The first reason you should choose policy A is communication.

Communication is my first reason because some students need to arrange plans that take place after school with their parents or other adults.

some students may need to do this because they could be staying after school and need to arrange a ride with a parent or adult as soon as possible.

Communication is also my first reason because if a student needs something for class they can ask their parent to drop it off during free time or lunch.

This is why communication is my first reason.

My second reason is long term projects.

long term projects is my second reason because now most students have phones that are advanced enough that they can hold files that are important to a project that can be edited on the phone.

Another reason I choose long term projects is because most phones now have e-mail and during free time or lunch you can e-mail a partner new information about the project to your partner if they are sick so they can still do their part of the project.

This is why long term projects is my second reason.

The third reason I choose is schedules.

This is my third reason because most cell phones can create schedules and planners and when a student gets a free time or lunch, they can plan out their week and plan when homework is due and when to start projects.

Another reason I choose this is because some students might lose their agenda book and have to move it on to their phone.

I believe that policy 2 works better because students will not be so tempted to text during class and disrupt others while they are working. And so that while testing days they wont be able to cheat off of each other. Also, kids won't follow the rule turn off there cell phones during class. And if they need to call someone they could use the school phone. So there isn't a real reason why cell phones should be at school. Cell phones are just a distraction during the day. Think if you were taking a test and all you could hear was the kid next to you texting for the answers. What do you think?

Isn't it a distraction to you and everyone around the kid? Well in my opinion that is just annoying. And think about when they are walking down the hall. They are texting and looking at there phone then they run into someone or they could trip and injure themselves and others. And if they and using there phone down the stairs they would trip and injure everyone on the way down. And that's why you should pick policy 2.

E11028B183D4,"To the Principal:

As you can probably tell, many kids at school have cell phones. They are an essential part of everyday life for kids and adults alike. I'm sure you have a phone and use it a lot for different reasons. Some reasons are the same as kids here at school. Many kids bring their phones to school to use before, after, or during school. I understand that some kids bring their phones and text or use the internet during class, but I think that can be prevented if you allow us to use our phones during our lunch and free periods.

You should choose policy one. I don't think kids should be texting during class, but most kids do. They do that because they don't get any other time to do so. If you let kids have their phones out during lunch and other free time, I think texting in class will reduce.

Sometimes kids have to contact their parents or parents have to contact their kids. Teachers don't always allow kids to use their phone to do so. If we are allowed to have our phones out during lunch, this would give kids time to contact their parents, or for parents to contact their kids. Parents sometimes change transportation options so they need to let their kids know before school lets out. Kids also forget things, or need to remind their parents of something. If you chose policy two, it would be hard to ask your mom or dad to bring you your lunch, your PE uniform, or remind each other of things.

If you choose policy two, I don't think people would be very happy. Kids may also still use their phones during class, even though it's not allowed. Sometimes people do things, just because they are against the rules. This rule would be that could be easily broken.

I hope you will consider my reasons for choosing policy one, as I am a kid myself and know what would happen if policy two is chosen. Parents and kids alike will be happier and more comfortable if kids are allowed to use their phones during lunch and free periods. Choosing policy one will also help reduce texting during class, or when phones aren't allowed. Thank you for considering my opinion.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I believe that you should select your first policy. If students can have there phones out during free time and lunch periods than they will be less likely to use try and use the in class. During school kids complain that they are not able to use there cell phones at all in school, but if they could use them during free times than they could talk with friends then and not have a need to during class. Think of what would happen if you go with the second policy, students will try and talk to friends during your teachers classes. When the students use there cell phones in classes they worry more about number one, getting caught and number two being able to talk to there friends. Most schools worry that students that have internet capability will post mean things about other students on social networking sites. You cant stop students from posting it at there homes, so they will do it there instead so you cant prevent that from happening.

If you select the alternative policy, and not the first policy than students would not be allowed to have them of use at school at all. If they were not to be of use than students would make it a game or a competition to see who can text the longest without getting caught by the teacher. It would be better to have them at use in school because than students that want to learn can and the students that don't want to learn repeat the same classes until they pay attention enough to pass there class.

Not being able to have a cell phone out at any time of the school day would be a bad idea. Having cell phones out during free time in the day would be a much better selection. Having cell phones out during class is a bad idea, but during their free time is there free time to do anything they want that is school appropriate.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
A3CE5BBDCD11,"To whom it may concern,

I believe that students should not be allowed to bring phones to school at all due to the fact that they can be distracting, they can be lost or stolen and can be used to start trouble.

Cell phones can be distracting during class. If a student forgets to turn their phone on silent or off it could go off during class and distract other students from their class work or test. Another way cell phones are distracting is that a student could show other students a funny text message or photo they received.

Most students carry their cell phone in their pocket or purse. When a student walks or engages in some physical activity the cell phone could fall out of their pocket without them realizing that this has happened. A student could leave their purse unattended, and someone could go through their purse and steal the cell phone without anyone noticing because the purse is left unattended. The school will be blamed that their cell phone has been stolen or gone missing. It will then be the schools responsibility to replace or find that cell phone.

Most phones have camera and or access to social networking sites these days. Students could use these features to harass someone. Someone could send a picture of another student around the whole school or they could post things about someone over the internet on their phone. They could also text someone things that could hurt a person's feelings. This is called cyber-bullying.

Others might think that cell phones are a great way to communicate and keep in touch with other students or family. They may also think that since cell phones are turned off during class that nothing can happen. They may also think that student's wouldn't harass someone in such a way.

On the other hand i feel as if cell phones do not belong in a learning environment. The school could be held responsible for a student's lost or stolen cell phone. Students could cyber bully a student through text messaging and photos. Cell phones can also go off in class and distract other students from their work.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8

So either way students are going to end up using there cell phones anyway don't matter what the problem is. Some students might leave there gym clothes or homework they had that night.

I really think that u should let the students bring their cell phones to school and be able to use them at lunch and other free class time because someone's mom might need to talk to them.

Example one: The reason why the students should be able to bring phones to school is because it shows them that you can trust them not to use their cell phones during class time.

Meaning that if the students use their cell phones during class time the teachers would give them three chances then after those three chances are up the teacher gets to take the students cell phone until the end of the school day.

Example two: Is that if the students can use their cell phones during free time classes the can do whatever they want in their free time they could talk on the phone, text people, play games, and etc.

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME

and I wanted to talk to you about the cell phone policy with you. My opinion on the policy is to not have cell phones out at all. I have a couple of ways to back up my opinion.

First off, I think cell phones are a really big distraction during school. When the teacher is teaching a lesson teachers do NOT want the kids to be side tracked so they don't learn. That would be a huge problem. They would do very poorly on tests and would have bad report cards (which grades are very important to me).

Also, if the kids have their cell phones out during free time or lunch break they could be sending out some things such as showy pictures of themselves and sending the pictures to different people in other schools or people around the school. They could also be bullying someone that doesn't fit in as well as other people or are just different. And that wouldn't be good for the kids or the teachers.

I strongly suggest you should allow students to have their cell phones out during the lunch time, and free time. They should definitely turn their phones off during class time, because we need to get their education. During class time, if some students just paying attention to their phones, they wouldn't get any learning done, or even pay attention to what the teachers are saying. I suggest, when coming into the class room, the students hand their phone over to the teacher, or must show the teacher him or her turning it off. The teacher would know that the students paying attention then. Having your phone in class, is foul. What if there is a test coming up, and the class is going over it, and the student is not paying attention. That student would fail, just because of his or her phone. The only time through out the day they should have their phones should be, free time and lunch. There is no learning being done, so why not have it out. There really isn't no harm in having your phone out during those times of the school day. If the students shows defiance, or abuse to the phone rule, the phone should get taken from that student. The students should get three warnings. 1. Warning. 2. Taken till end of class. 3. Parent has to come get it. Its good that you may allow us to have phones out, but if they abuse these rules, you should cut students from having phones in or at our school period.

Dear principal,

I think that all students should be able to use their phones when allowed. Like this students will get less distracted and pay more attention to the teacher because they know that they will have time to use it! Also think about this kids will get more passing grades because they will get less distracted in their classes but that's if we are allowed to use our phones on our free times or in our lunch. We should also have the ability to use our iPods or electronics what ever we have as long as it's safe.

We can pay more attention and if our phones, or iPods get stolen then that will be our own responsibility because ewe are the ones that want to bring and use. We should totally have the right to do it and like this teacher would get us less in trouble! I think that this will be the best solution for kids getting their phones taken away from teacher or any electronic that you might have. And I don't think that this could hurt someone or something why cant we have the right to be able to use our phones in our free time we got nothing else to do so we might as well do it on something that we like. When classes start and we will follow the rule of keeping them turned off. And if not we you teachers should just take them away and have a parent call school and get it back. I think that almost all students might agree with me and keep phones out during class.

Just let us have the right to have our cell phones out and use them in our free time. Than just teacher taking them away because they are using them in class. I think that will help teacher a lot of sending phones to the office and it will be much better if we could do that and not hide our phones or what ever you may have.

I believe that students should be able to have their phones during school. I think that phones are a nice resource to have. Although students are allowed to have their phones you could put restrictions on when they are allowed to be used. You could tell students that they are only allowed to be used during free times and not classes. If you find a student using their phone during class you could take it away.

I think letting them use their phones would resist them from the temptations to hide using it. Whether they are allowed to or not they will still use their phones. They will just hide the fact that they are using them. If you don't let them use their phones. It would make it less cool to use their phone because everyone will be using them but if you say that they can't then they will just be more rebellious and try to use it without your knowledge. You could make consequences for misusing your phone.

Our phones are a good source of communication and something that we should take advantage of. It makes communicating with your parents much easier and quicker. Instead of going through assistants or teacher for parents to talk to their students they could just contact them. It is also a good way for students to find each other.

36AADFA80764,"I think that the first policy, that students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during free periods or lunch as long as they are turned off during class is the better policy. You should let the students use them first because that will reduce the amount of times kids try to sneak their phones, and get in trouble, including during class. If you let them use during lunch and free periods, then the kids will be happy to have gotten to use it at all, and therefore have no reason to sneak it in class.

Another reason why the first policy should be put into action is because sometimes kids forget things like lunch money or their homework, and they need to contact their parents to bring it. Also, if a student needs to talk to a parent about a ride home or an after school activity, but the parents can only talk during those hours because of work times, or if it involves something directly after school, then there would be a need to contact the parents during a free time or during lunch.

The last reason why you should choose policy one is because the children are going to try to communicate anyways, they mine as well do it in a manner that is at least quiet. If they do it quietly then the teachers supervising the, can get more work done, and other children that don't communicate can get things done too without the distraction of kids talking out loud around them.

The kids work hard each day at school, and they should be able to talk with their friends, why not do it quietly if they are not in a class being taught at the moment?      ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I know that many students don't respect the school rules. They are using their phones during class instead of putting attention, or people steal their phones and etc,. and just wasting money buying one and another.

Its better to do not allow students to have phones at school, so they can put more attention to class. But what happen if its an emergency and a student didn't bring his phone because his school do not allow cell phones?

He has to call his parents so they can pick him up because they don't know at what time to pick him up because sometimes he has tutoring sometimes not, or maybe they are busy or in another close city. He can't enter to the school to call his parents because the school its already ended, for some reason, like here in my school that they do not allow students to go in after school ends. He can't call his aunt, uncle grandma even his parents, Why? Because he doesn't have a cell phone. What would happen to that student?

I believe that the first policy will be a good choice for the cell phone issue because student may have to contact family member or their parents through out the day. If there was an emergency with some one an they need to know about it they should be able to do so at lunch or any other free time they might have. The student might have to figure out where they have to go after school or if there parents want them home. Student should be able to use there cell phone when they have breaks, and when they are in class have to turn them off. I think that the students wouldn't be using there cell phones in class as much if they would get to use them at lunch or breaks. I also think that allowing student to use their cell phones during breaks will let them maybe check up on thing that are going on at home, or let them know if their parents are planning on picking them up early. I think this would be a better policy for the school then the second policy.

But inside the class room they should be turned off inside the class room and if you get caught with a cell phone out you get in trouble by the principal and you don't get back until your mom up and straighten everything out and that mean that you cant bring it to school no more. In between lunch and free period you should to use not just to call your mom just to come get you .You should be allow to do that only three times unless you have a dentist appointment that same day or a doctors appointment. Will in lunch you should be able to call your mom and tell you fast food or some homemade food because maybe you just don't eat lunch inside of school or you just think their lunch is nasty or just look nasty.,2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

I think we should be able to bring cell phones to school an use them during our free periods. If something bad happens an we have our phones we can call for help.

I think that if they let us do that us kids will respect that we have to turn it off during class time in order to use them in our free periods. I think that the you should go with policy one.

Policy two, In my mind is wrong because if something happens when we get off the bus an we don't have our phones with us we would be stuck in that situation, an not only could we get hurt, we could get robbed, kidnapped, an a lot worse.

Plus, what if our parents need to get a in touch with us at school an they cant drive the school, what are they supposed to do then? The answer is nothing. We wont be able to get in touch to know that something is wrong. I mean yeah some kids are not mature enough to follow the rules an not text during class, but that doesn't mean everybody should get punished for it. Cause its there responsibility, they should just get the people that are doing wrong and then punish them, but not everybody else that hasn't done anything wrong.

Another reason i think you should let the student bring their phones to school is because if you don't let them then their will be a lot of students who will do it anyway and then you will have to do something about it so it would be a lot easier to just allow phone to be brought to school. One example is that you will catch a look of students on their phone and you will have to punish them all when it would be a lot easier if they were not doing any thing wrong and that is why i think that student should be allowed to bring phones to school.

I choose policy 1, because its not bad to have their phones out at lunch period or any free time they have. I just think they should have them at their free time.

Well here are some reasons why I think that. Well for one they are not doing any school work or anything that's for school so why would you make them be bored. For second they can have their phones out and do want they want so they don't have to do it in class and get caught. Its not a bad idea and you should let the students have something that they want, because they are in school for like 8 hours and that's so bad. It drives me crazy everyday, I have to sit in a chair and do work and not even have my phone out at free time. Seriously that's wrong well I think it is and I probably think a lot of students do too. So you should let them have their phones out at free time, because they will love it and they probably will put it up when class starts. Just give them a chance and see how they do and if they have there phones out in class then say no more phones at free time anymore. Would you like to get chance at something that you would probably want? Well think about that for a while. I don't even know why we cant have our phones out at free time seriously we are not doing anything unless we are talking to our friends. So what is they big deal about having our phones out at free time, Do you really want to be rude and makes us wait in till we get out of school before we can use our phones. I just think its a good idea and I hope you do too because its awesome and amazing idea I don't know what other idea can think of.

Well anyways think about what I asked you and see what your answer is, because its not a bad idea about having our phones out at free time. I would be really happy if you did let them and that would make them a hole lot better. I bet if you had a phone when you were little and you wanted it out so you can be on it, but I don't know. Well the only I'm trying to say is give them a chance and see how they do because you will never know unless you try.

The phone is a true necessity indeed. It has established world wide communication, saved lives, and brought further advancement in technology. So what do I think of the phone? I believe it is a true tool indeed, and that it should be allowed in school, but only during free time. This is because phones help students communicate with their parents if they left something at home or need something, and the phone can also help improve student relationships by reducing social boundaries. Although you may say that the phone can increase bullying and other problems like sex ting, the technology that is available today can help diminish that by adding censors and what not.

Let's say this, OTHER_NAME

has left his language arts homework at home because he heard his bus roaring down the road and he had just woke up. So what does he do? Most likely it's rush out the door with as much of his essentials as possible, but he accidentally forgot his homework on his work desk. So as OTHER_NAME

arrives at school, he shuffles through his book bag and notices that his homework is missing, and the school's late work policy is cruel, stating that if work is late just one day, then it will not be accepted, but OTHER_NAME

here is very lucky, his language arts class is after one of the free time periods and he has a cell phone. So what does he do? He calls his parents for help and soon his mom comes to school with his homework and he gets an A. This goes to show how beneficial cell phones are at school during free time, but then, during the second free time of the day (lunch time), OTHER_NAME

doesn't have anybody to sit with.

Cell phones were originally designed for increased communication, but now with the introduction of new smart phones with instant messaging and other cool applications, they are now a social and business tool. OTHER_NAME

here can text his friends during lunch and say, ""Hey, I'm sitting at lunch table B, come and join me over here so we can chat."" So being his friends, they would most likely come over to his table and accompany him during lunch. So by the end of the day, everybody is happy. Except for the big, bad bully OTHER_NAME

who was jealous of OTHER_NAME

and his friends.

OTHER_NAME, being the bully he is, begins to go onto Face book during locker break (also a free time) and he begins posting horrible things onto OTHER_NAME

's wall. This might be your counter argument, but this isn't a strong argument. With the technology today, school's can place censors on radio waves. Meaning that if OTHER_NAME

here goes onto Face Book and posts, ""OTHER_NAME

is such an idiot ."" Then the censor will detect that and immediately terminate the post. Therefore keeping evil at bay.

As you can see, communication is an extremely vital tool for the success of further improving the academic system and social system, and this means that Policy 1 (Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.) is the best choice for students academically and socially.

Cell phone is a very popular device now a days and almost everyone use it to communicate with others. I have a cell phone my self too. I think cell phone is appropriate for student to use during lunch periods and other free times as long as they turn off their cell phone during class and use it for appropriate matters. Cell phone can help people solving matters by talking on the phone and contact when some emergency happened.

Cell phone can help people in many ways, as long as we have a limit on it.

Cell phone is a device that has many functions. It can help people in many ways. When there is an emergency at school, the best device to use to communicate with your parent to tell them you are safe, or polices to report the incident is cell phone. Cell phone is not a direct contact, but it gives the least secure to a matter such as you are safe, some specific thing happening in school, and some decision that can be solve using cell phone instead of meeting face to face. Cell phone will be fine to use at school as long as students are using it for the correct matter and does not let the cell phone disrupt them during class.

As time went by, more and more function appear on the cell phone can make our student and adult's life easier. Some cell phone can even go to the internet! Some people can use cell phone as a material to find resource, study online, and read books online instead of carry those heavy books home. Cell phone is simplification for many thing you do, it can not absolutely replace books, but it makes easier for people to read and study. If we can let the student to bring the cell phone to school and only let them use it during free periods or lunch time. I'm sure that it would benefit both our student and you.

I think we should change the original policy and go with policy #1

We students were abusing our cell phone privileges and were being distracted, and distracting others. I approve of policy #1 because, it allows us to still have our cell phones yet helps prevent us from being distracted or distracting. I think it is very appropriate to only be allowed to use them during free times.

I do not think policy #2 would be a good choice for the following reasons:

Students need some way in contacting someone in an emergency before, during, or after school, even if the problem is the don't have a ride, or want to see if they could hang out at a friends house. What if they forget something at home. We all know some student forget his or her home work today. do you want the office phone all jammed up just for home work? What if there is a fire, cant use the office phone its all plugged up.

In conclusion, Policy 1 Lets students have there phones unless they use them during class. Prevents distractions so that students can learn and not be distracted. Thus policy also lets students have some freedom with their phones, but only during there free periods/lunch. Policy 2, however, does not even let them have there phone at school no matter what. It also prevents them from getting help in case of emergency, or even lack of ride. This is why Policy 1 is the better choice of the change of policies.

I think that students should not be aloud to bring there cell phone to school, because you know as well as everyone else that there is going to be some one that doesn't turn there phone off. If you allow students to bring a cell phone to school then they might use it on a test. For example, a student has a big math test coming up that he/she did not study for. So that student could very easily bring his phone to class and use the calculator on it. They could also text there friend and ask them for the answer. If you do allow students to bring there phone to school the teacher should take up everyone one phones during class and if a student were to sneak it in the teacher should write him up or give then ISS.

If students were allowed to bring there phone to school they may have dirty pictures and show them to people. A student could also use his or her phone during school to threaten so body then they may not want to come to school. bringing cell phones to school would just make it easier for girls to spread rumors or gossip about someone.

I think that you should think about letting the children have there phones in school. it would help reduce all the students having them out during classes and reduce the amount of phones taken each day. This would give more class time instead of worrying about kids having phones out.

If students were allowed to have phones out during lunch periods and free times then that would give them time to call and check up on loved ones such as moms dads and other family members. This would help students keep up on school work by setting reminders on there cell phones to remind them when an assignment is due. Teachers could collect phones when it is time for there class to start to prevent kids from using them in or during class time.

I think students shouldn't have cells phones at school because its an distraction to all of the students. But it will be different if the students were just a little quiet with the cell phones, but instead they decide to bring DRAMA to the schools. Cell phones are the number one reason why fights are getting started at schools around the country. If they didn't have cell phones the percentage of fighting and arguing will be decreased.

Also ,there's another reason I think they should ban the cell phones because if we were to use our cell phones in class the only thing that would happen is that no one will learn anything but how to TALK on the cell phone, and how to TEXT on the cell phones and that's mainly the problem that we are still having to today.

Next, is the drama it causes sometimes it can ruin an friend ship or even a marriage it can be that serious. But to lose an husband or an wife a family mmbe an best friend over some stuff like that is really childish and it needs to STOP before it gets out of hand.

I understand your concern on the growing cell phone use at school. It interferes with our learning and it distracts us from our responsibilities. Cell phones were given to us by our parents or were payed for by us so that we can interact in healthy ways and can communicate. They help us learn how to talk to other people our age and older, or younger, and they help us learn responsibility for our belongings.

My response to the cell phone use at school is, let us have them at school, but, let us have them out at free time. Those times include: lunch, in the halls, in the locker rooms, outside, after class, etc. If we are not doing anything productive at those times then why can't we have them out anyways? They aren't being used as cheating methods. They aren't being used as ways to be distracted because we aren't doing anything but talking anyways. A way to make sure we don't have them during class is to make sure, by watching them turn their phones off while class is in session, then they can turn them off when class is dismissed.

Also, another good reason we should be allowed to have cell phones at schools is because it would be an easier way to call our parents if need be. We wouldn't have to get up go to the office and call from that phone. We could just text, or call, from our own cell phones, because sometimes parents think their child is in trouble if they see the school number pop up on their phone.

I thank you for taking time for reading my letter and I sincerely hope that you will think about the option of cell phone use during free time at our school.

I believe that students at school should not be allowed to have cell phones at school. I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.

Look at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades.

I understand you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy.

The first policy, I believe, would be more convenient for most students.

Some students participate in clubs or activities after school; therefore, they might have to call in order to get picked up.

If a student leaves a homework assignment or another important item at home, they could use there cell phones to have someone bring it for them.

A student might need there cell phone to call there parents or friends about an activity they planned to do after school.

Since cell phones are a disruption during class time, the students must turn them completely off.

The teacher should be allowed to check if a students phone is on or off, and if it is on they should be allowed to take it.

Cell phones in school has brought up many debates recently about whether they are to be banned at school or if they will be allowed to be used by students during free time such as lunch, before and after school, or other free times.

Of the proposals that you have suggested I believe that allowing students to use cell phones during free time is a wiser decision.

With this option students will have the chance to contact parents about changes of events or other news that may be necessary.

This proposal is a wise decision.

I believe this because due to today's fast pace many people are very busy during the day.

By letting students be linked to the mobile world during free time I believe that grades will improve because students will not be worried or stressed about what is going on outside of school.

I also believe that if students have free time where they will be allowed to use technology such as cell phones, cell phone use in class will decrease.

Allowing students to use cell phones during free time is a wiser decision than to ban all cell phone use.

Of your policies I believe your first is a better decision, while your second has major flaws.

With your second policy to ban all cell phones at school, I believe that many students will suffer academically.

Because cell phone use would be banned many students would sneak use during class, instead of during a free time where they would be permitted.

If this were to happen students would not pay any notice to the lesson being taught and grades would suffer.

Many students would also be at a loss because contact to parents would be very difficult and schedule changes would go unnoticed.

C7C8290B69FD,"I think you should go for the first school policy about phones. Students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school but only to be used during their free time. The reason why is that if you ban phones from the school than students might not really care and they will just bring their cell phones anyways. On the other hand you should also warn that their cell phones could be brought in and used only in their free time. You can also warn that cell phones will be confiscated if students are found using them in class.

The main reason is because they wont really care if cell phones are allowed and you don't really do anything about it. The more this happens, the more they will get used to it. If cell phones are just banned then they will still do the same thing, only they will use them more often, behind the teachers' back. This is why you should allow them the freedom for cell phones to be used only in their freedom. That way they know when and what will happen if caught. Otherwise they will continue to use phones in class if they are not confiscated until the end of class. If the phones were to be confiscated for a longer period of time, than maybe the students will start using them less and less often in class. The policy should have other things added in like for phones to be confiscated for long periods of time, consequences, and or like the contact of parents if caught using phones in class. This will not only get them in trouble in class but at home maybe, if not they will not learn. If they do manage to realize, than they will do better in the future or think better of the consequences.

Basically you should allow cell phones but with not so many heavy punishments that they will continue their previous acts with out caring. You should still have consequences and warn students of confiscation for long periods of time. This might make them use phones only during recess or lunch or other free times available to them. In the time being of the confiscation they will think better of their actions and therefore act better of it.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

And there is also a good use of the cell phones. Teachers can use it to send work to the students through text messages and the students can send there answers back. Also the students can help other students with there work by talking to them through texts. It will also be easier to remind students of up coming tests and remind them to study.

I think that kids should not be able to use there phones during school because of many reasons such as, not paying attention in class. Also if kids are aloud to use the phone during a free time might encourage them to use it in class. kids would get into lots more trouble with teachers if they use there phone in class.

First, kids should not be able to use there phone in class because, they will not pay attention in class. If kids are not paying attention in class then kids knowledge is not growing. We really need a smarter generation to help stop important stuff. Like someone in my generation could find a cure for cancer and become rich and successful. Someone in my generation could help the economy and things could be more affordable. also people could be not in debt. That is me first reason kids should not use there phones in school.

Second, If we have a free period of time were we can use are phones then that would cause trouble to because, since there phones are in there pockets it encourages them to use it in class. Also kids are not getting any smarter texting all the time. Soon kids will be using texting in there school reports and start to fail. That is my second reason why kids should not use there phones in school.

Finally, kids would start to fail there classes because, kids would start to into there texting and also calling people. Also kids would start to cheat on test by using there phones in class and getting answers from people. Soon kids would start to get caught and get into lots of trouble.

I think the first policy you are considering is better than the other one. However I do think it might or might not cause trouble. The only reason I would use my phone during school is to text my parents telling them if I'm riding the bus or not. Kids use their phones a lot. So that could also mean that some kids are going to text each other during these free periods. They already text during class anyway. Having the phones turned off during class might not work because to enforce that rule, the teachers would have to make sure each and every phone is off, and this could take up class time. Besides, kids would probably turn them right back on as soon as the teacher turns their back. But, I agree with this policy because like I said, some kids might have to tell their parents something. If we couldn't have phones, we would have no way of communicating with our parents, and we might get stranded at school, then Mom gets worried and calls the police, then an entire search goes on just to find that one kid sitting there at the front of their school. Cell phones have become a natural part of out life, so taking them away would almost be like taking away one of our limbs for the day, and that's an important limb too. But even if you do go with your second policy, there's no guarantee that kids won't bring their phone to school. I mean, already we're not supposed to have them, but every kid brings them anyway. Regardless if they have to talk to their parents or not. However if you did let us have our phones out, even for that little half an hour at lunch, it could make all the difference. Kids might actually be happier at school knowing they're allowed to have their phones. I think kids might feel restricted by not being able to use that little part of their life at school, where they are a majority of the time. Kids in a way need their phones.

We are in the era of technology, and we depend on technology very much. Nowadays, it is rare to find a student without a cell phone. Students bring there cell phones to school even if they're not allowed, so I say that students should be allowed to use their cell phones during free time only. They should bring their cell phones for emergencies, help on assignments, and relaxation.

I myself have a cell phone, but I only use it after school to call my mom or sister, and I am sure that many other kids have a cell phone for that purpose too. I know that schools have plenty of phones available, but they might not let you use it unless it's a drastic emergency. I consider forgetting your homework or backpack an emergency, but the office may not think so. You may have ripped your pants, and you need to call home for some new ones. You don't was to be wearing ripped pants all day long.

My second reason for bringing a cell phone is that many cell phones have internet. The internet is useful when you are doing some last minute studying or you want extra help on an assignment. You may say that the internet provides websites that should not be used during school, but it's during free time, so they won't be disturbing the class. Free time may be boring, so you may want to go on a chatting site or play games on your favorite website.

Many cell phones have the ability to store music. Research shows that music encourages creativity and your imagination. You can listen to music before a writhing prompt or art class to get some ideas of what to paint or write about. This may improve your grade because the art or writing came easy to you. Music also helps some people concentrate on their work because it relaxes them. Kids that usually cause trouble can be relaxed and calm after listening to relaxing music.

As you can see, cell phones work for many purposes. They come in handy when you have an emergency, you need some last minute studying, or you just want to relax before a test. So come on TEACHER_NAME. How can you not allow cell phones after reading these reasons for allowing them.      ",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8

Being able to use our cell phones in lunch and when we have free time in classes is an excellent idea. The students would have a brake from learning and do something that they want to do. Letting us have use of our cell phones in school would be a privilege that I am sure no one would be upset about.

I believe that the first policy would be the best policy because it would give the students at the school more freedom. We would be able to text our friends without worrying that they would be taken away. When having our cell phones out, it would make tons of kids happy and would make the school much more exciting.

When our cell phones are off during the times when we are learning and trying to get an education is also important. Turning them off during this means that no one can get distracted, confused, and we can stay focused when the teacher has or is explaining something. We can also listen to what is going on in class.

When having our cell phones off when we are working makes it more exciting when we have free time and can take it right out of our backpacks or pockets and text our friend to see what is going on with them and just talk.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I have heard about the new cell phone policies that you have been thinking of.

I feel that policy number 2 is the better one of the 2 choices.

hear are a couple of the reasons why I personally think this.

Students enjoy using their phone every day.

I feel that sometimes the can use it a little to much during school.

I think that letting students use their phones during lunch and free time is an excellent idea.

Also students wouldn't be interrupting class every day with their cell phones.

This would be a lot better than just getting rid of cell phones completely.

As principal you might want to consider possibly figuring out a schedule were students have free time during a couple of their classes.

Doing this would not only help the new policy, but keep it going throughout the school year.

students would appreciate it if during a boring class they got a 5-15 minute break to relax and use their phones.

But, there would be some rules behind the free time.

You would have to think of them so that students wouldn't be doing stuff that is against school rules.

So principal please consider the second policy for cell phones at our school.

students do want to use their cell phones and not keep them at home.

I hope you liked the reasons why please se",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I believe that Policy two would be better for students and teachers. Policy two states: ""Do not allow students to have phones at school at all"". I think this would be a good idea because students are too preoccupied with their phones and other electronics to concentrate on other things of importance. If phones are allowed in school, the fact that the phones are supposed to only be used at free time and lunch will not matter. Students that have free time will be on their phones texting other friends that are in class. Teachers may end up taking phones up because their students are not focusing on their work, but are instead playing on their phones. Students not paying attention in class can lead to their grades dropping. This also means that teachers will have to work harder to keep the classes attention.

Policy two will keep students on track, and they will earn even better grades. I also presume that teachers will have less work, without having to have meetings with parents about student's low grades. That is to say that allowing phones at school is a dreadful idea. I think that most adults would agree with me on this topic. Teenagers all over the world are becoming more involved with their phones every day. It would be better to have students focusing on their school work and grades rather than their social life.

I really believe policy number one is really the best because students know they cant use the phone during school so they decide to use it during class, lunch, or free periods.

I have noticed you were deciding to make a new policy and were deciding between allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during their own time, or not having students bringing cell-phones at all. As being a student, I think cell-phones are highly important because they are used everyday for personal reasons. I strongly believe that you should allow students to bring their phones and only allow them to use their phones during their own time.

From past experiences, there are many times when something last minute comes up and you need to call a parent or guardian to see what is going on. Students with cell-phones can easily call or text their parent or guardian and find out the answer. It is a quick and simple thing to do. But if you do not have cell-phones allowed at school, you would have more students needing to use the office's phone for just the silliest little things. It would cause students to have to constantly use the office phone and would cause you to have anther thing to stress about.

Another reason students should have their cell-phones is because there are certain situations when something embarrassing happens and you would rather talk to your parents in private than having to go to the office. If you talk to your parents on a cell-phone, you can go somewhere private to talk to them. If you go to the office, anybody can go in and hear what you are saying. You can't get complete privacy and even if you talk low enough, the person on the other line might not be able to hear you.

Finally, allowing students to have cell-phones is also a way of trusting us. Taking cell-phones away will cause us to believe you don't trust us. If you have not been hearing complaints from teachers about students cheating with cell-phones, there really isn't any purpose of you having to take them away.

In conclusion, cell-phones are fairly important to the students and should be allowed in school. They are necessary for information on rides and mishaps. We should be trusted with them. If some students don't respect the rules, not everyone should be punished. That is why I think cell-phones should be allowed in school.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Everyone loves to use the cell phone. Because it can connect us. We can talk to our friends. But now, a lot of students bring their cell phone to school. Some of them use the cell phone in the class. It was noisy. It makes students can't study.

So, I think you can't allow the student bring their cell phone at all. Because now, we can play the games, watch the video and listen the music, if the student bring the cell phone, they always play the cell phone and not study. The school is for studying, not for playing. And some student maybe will take away their cell phone. That is bad for the students.

Third, some students doesn't have money to buy the cell phone. It will makes they feel bad. And it maybe will makes the students buy the expensive cell phone to bring to school. I don't think it is good for the students.

If the student just play the cell phones. They aren't talk to anyone. They are not to make some friends. It just will make the students become cool and not like to make friends. Of course, we have to use the cell phone in the life. I think Principal can put some phone in the school. Let the student bring the money to use the phone will be better.

You are considering two policy's about having cell phones at school. The first, is to not let the students have cell phones at school. Second, to let the kids have them at school, but to not let them be on during class time. I strongly believe that you should let us have our cell phones at school ,and just have them off during class time.

I think that we should be allowed to have our cell phones at school, but not have them on during class. This is because, sometimes things happen outside of school that students need to know.

For example, say that someone's parent had to let the student know that they wouldn't be home when they said they would. The student would be able to check their phone during lunch and find out what they needed to know. Plus, kids have cell phones for a reason, and if we have our phones with us at school we will be able to contact people during the designated times about various things.

I don't think that you should make a rule that the students shouldn't be able to bring their phones to school for many reasons. I, for one, believe that children can be responsible if there are known consequences. If you are debating to not have phones at school because they might be texting, or using their phones to cheat during class then make a strict rule for it. You could say, that if a teacher finds you using your phone in class then there will be no warning it will just be taken away. If kids know that there will be a consequence then they will usually not break the rules.

Therefore, if you don't want kids to be fooling around on their phones during school then you can make sure that doesn't happen, but don't take away the student's rights to be able to contact people as, and when, they need. I strongly believe that students have the right to have their phones at school, if, and only if, they follow the rules and not abuse their privileges.

I think we people text in school it is a sign if u can do to things at once more power to you if u can get good grades and text why not.

Teachers don't understand how important it is to be social if America wasn't social America we would not have the things we need. Us kids and young adults know what we need to do to get stuff done

Cell Phones are what that are making every thing work. If we didn't have cell phones things wouldn't get done. Study parties get planned when people talk to each other and know where people are

Teachers don't know kids don't text in class unless its boring so maybe the teachers should make class more exciting and more hands on so are hands cant be texting the whole time

All most all adults would not a agree with me they say ""We were kids not to long ago"". But adults don't understands things have change a lot since they were kids. When most adults were kids they didn't even know what a cell phones was.

Some of the kids that don't have cell phones may be resentful that they don't and that's why they say its such a big distraction. I really dint understand why really before i got my cell phone is 6th grade I didn't rat on anyone come on guys really just wait a few years and u will be having fun like the rest of us and you wouldn't want to be in trouble because of some kids that don't have one would?

I heard you where considering to allow student to bring their cell phones to school and use them during lunch and free time, but having them turned off during class. I think that is very wise and good decision. This cell phone policy would give all of us (the students) some freedom. It would allow us to do something entertaining outside of learning during school. First of all, sometimes we do need to have some time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. Secondly, putting it away during class is very reasonable and I think that all the student will understand. Finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would take away from getting in trouble for using it without permission.

First of all, sometimes we do need to have some time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. Communicating with our parents or friends is something that as teenagers we normally do. We all have to check our emails, or call or text to. It is a norm of today's society. So why not let us do what everyone else normally does.

Secondly, putting it away during class is very reasonable and I think that all the student will understand. You give us sometime during the day to use and we will repay by putting it away during class so that we could learn. All the student would put it away because you have relieved our urgency to use it. I know you think we wont but I am sure that once we have time to use, during class it wont be that necessary. Which leads me to my last reason.

Finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would take away from getting in trouble for using it without permission. We wont be getting in trouble for using it during school because we have already had time to use with permission. The number of kids in the CSI room would decline and we wont have as many kids getting in trouble for something that we have had permission to do. Wouldn't you love an CSI room, without a student in trouble to be seen. Well that what that cell phone policy would bring.

In conclusion, if you would let use our cell phones during lunch or free time that would cause a good change in our school. First of all, sometimes we do need to have some time to use our cell phones during school to communicate with other people. Secondly, putting it away during class is very reasonable and I think that all the student will understand. Finally, giving the students some time to use their cell phones would take away from getting in trouble for using it without permission. Please think about this policy and be the wise man that you are and choose it over the other policy. Remember what i said ""a CSI room without a student in trouble to be seen.""

I believe that children that are in school should be aloud to have there phones just not in the class room itself .I think that because it's not really fair telling someone that they cant have something with them even if it is off in there pocket or purse because it is not bothering anyone if its off .I mean really the only age groups you have to worry about having phones is middle school and high school student because most elementary school kids do not have cell phones .

I also think that if you have your cell phone in class and it goes off and interrupts the class it should be took for a week or two and then your parents can come and get it back from you .That is because it will teach them not to bring it in class or it will get took for a couple of weeks and most kids that have phones use them all the time and they know how hard it is to go with out them . So there for they know that if they bring it to class and it goes off they wont be able to talk to there friends except for in school and if they have a house phone to call people on . So maybe if you enforce this policy most intelligent kids will not bring there phones to class except for if they are put up and also off. So maybe if you do that you wont have to get rid of phones totally at the school you just have to make sure phones are off when kids step in the class and also make sure they are put away .

So now you have heard my opinion on what to do about cell phones in school what do you think of my idea ?I think your idea about getting cell phones out of the school totally is a little bit to hard on the kids .I understand why you don't want cell phones in the school nut still in there free time they should be able to do what they want well in reason anyway .So please take into consideration my idea about letting the kid have cell phones at school just off when you step into the classroom .Let me know as soon as you can what you think of this idea .

I think we should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. This is because phones are used for communicating with others who are not around for us to talk to we like using our phones to talk with our friends during school all the time so we should at least be able to talk to them at some time during school because school is to make new friends and learn

I understand that talking or texting on the phone during class is bad but we shouldn't be prohibited from bringing our phones to school because many bad things can happen when you cant contact someone for something that has happened to you such as getting lost or having an injury but cant get help from anyone also talking or texting through your phone is a way to know people more better or talk in private so that no one has to disturb you or listen to what you are say to that person so i think that your policy 1 is a better choice for the school",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

The school is changing its cell phone policy, and I believe the best decision would be to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during our free time. This choice allows us students to be able to call in case of an emergency, stay more organized, and enjoy our free time. After reading this letter, I hope you take my opinion into consideration because I believe I represent a majority of the students in this decision.

Having a phone means being able to communicate easily with other people, especially your family. By allowing us to bring our phones to school, we can be prepared for emergencies. A lot of things can happen during school that would require a call to your parents;

you could get sick, school could be let out early and you need to arrange for someone to pick you up, a fire could occur, or you could forget to bring medicine or an inhaler that you absolutely need. If you didn't have a phone, you wouldn't be able to get the help that you need quickly.

Phones aren't just for calling people; you can also use them as an organization tool. Make notes on what you need to get done or what classes you have homework in. With some phones, you can even schedule tests and events in a calendar or memo. We could also use our phones to plan study groups with friends before important exams. There are a lot of possibilities for using our phones in a way that is useful for us to do better in school, and keep up with dates and assignments.

Another reason why students would like to bring cell phones to school is to make the most out of their free periods. It's important for kids to not just learn at school, but to have fun. If we were to just have classes non-stop and not take breaks to relax with our friends, it would be even harder for us to pay attention and sit still. With phones, we can enjoy our free periods more. We can take pictures, text friends and family that aren't at school, and, with some phones, we can even play games to keep ourselves entertained. Also, we wouldn't be distracted with our phones during class because we would already satisfy our need to text and use our phones during our free periods. We would certainly follow the rules and put them away once class begins.

Being adolescents, we want to be connected with the world around us, and cell phones help us accomplish that. If you allow us to bring phones to school we would prepared for emergencies, be more organized, and enjoy our free time more. This change in the cell phone policy would help us in many ways, and we would really appreciate the trust you have in us to be able to allow us this privilege. Please consider this option, and keep in mind all of the wonderful things cell phones can achieve.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8

My letter to you today should make you think twice about cell phones in our school. In my own opinion I think we should have the cell phones in our school and I also think keeping it in our lockers isn't right. I do not think it's right only because if we kept our cell phones in our lockers what if there were to be a fire you would have to give out the money or even give new cell phones to the children of the school. I think many students would agree with that also. So I think it would be a lot better to have them and carry them around then to keep them in our lockers. Plus, if we carried them around children would want to come to school because they would want to text and things like that because you know how the children are not getting up for school . But having the cell phone would want them to come to school and if we used our cell phones at lunch and in our spare time a lot more children would have there work done and not blow it off like most students do. That's why i think we should have cell phones here in our school only because children would have there work done and would want to get there work done so they could text. Having the cell phones would be like a reward to them. The children would love it! Also less and less children would get in trouble for having there cell phones in there pockets or they wouldn't get in trouble as much for texting. That Means you would have less cell phones and less parents in your office to pick up the cell phones up.

I believe the new phone policy for our school should be policy number one, because to forbid phones from school altogether may cause more harm to our school, then good. Cell phone can be put on silent and wouldn't even make a sound or distraction. punishments could be made if the phone isn't on silent.

First off, i would rather accept consequences then leave my phone at home while i go off to school. I also know that most of my fellow students feel the same way. Even now, when phone are supposed to stay in lockers, students rarely follow that rule. the subject of ""no phones,"" is just unacceptable for kids. If phones were taken from children, then resentment toward teachers and grownups in general might start. kids wouldn't believe that the teachers are in for their best interests. most student wouldn't follow policy number two and them who knows what other school policies will be taken for granted.

Secondly, phones are not only for social uses, but for emergencies as well. If something bad were to happen and a student needed to contact someone, the school wouldn't have all the contacts that might be useful.

Last of all, there is absolutely no harm done if cell phones were allowed during break times. Being a student, i still understand that it's a big distraction when phones ring during class, but if the students phones are off, then there is no problem. if a phone does ring in class, then a lunch detention would suffice.

All in all, its very important for happy students to be involved socially with each other. support is needed for school, and i believe that phones are a great way to bring students together. if teachers took cell phones away from student, the students will not likely respond well. policy number two is defiantly in the students best interest.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I believe policy 1 is the best choice for our school. Even though phone usage is a problem there are many reasons students should at least have their phones. I see that during class, phones can be very distracting, but there are also a lot of useful places for a phone in a school day. Students may need their phones to contact parents, so they can inform them on afternoon activities. Phones may also be used to ask a friend to meet up for study hall so they can work on a project.

If students have their phones and an emergency occurs then they can use them to contact their parents for transportation, or inform them of their whereabouts. For most students a phone is a sign of security that serves as a lifeline to their parents. Faculty could easily monitor phone activity in the school by making shore kids had their phones in their backpack during class. Personally I don't see the phones being much of a problem if policy 1 was put into place.

If cell phones were banned from schools, students would not be distracted in school by them. Cell phones do have their uses, but those uses are not for school. Although cell phones are a way parents can reach their children it should not be allowed because kids are distracted by cell phones, and students can use cell phones to bully other students.

Cell phones are a huge distraction for students when trying to concentrate or be productive. Kids will stop what they are doing to text back their friend and take time away from the student and the student they are texting. Students texting in class takes time away from the student, the teacher, and the kids around the student. Whatever they are talking about can surely wait till they get out of school.

Furthermore, students having cell phones in school increases the chance of cyber-bullying. Cyber bullying is when kids send mean and hurtful things to another student. It is not only hurtful things, but they can send threats to a student. if a student feels threatened they will not be able to concentrate or work. school is a safe environment for kids and if they are being threatened they will be scared to even come to school.

Although cell phones are a way for parents to reach their child during an emergency, if everyone's parent called their child at the same time it wouldn't even go through. Most of the time its the parents who call their child when they are in class, disrupting the whole class. If it was a real emergency they could call the school and ask for you. having a cell phone at school isn't a necessity and its a distraction to a students learning and kids go to school to learn, not to talk on their phones.

I would like it if you would reconsider the cell phone policy. If students can have time during breaks and other free times such as lunch, the cell phone problem would be less of an inconvenience to you as well as teachers. It would give students an opportunity to text freely and not worry about getting in trouble as well as wasting time and or disrupting class. Texting during class will be the least of your worries. Teachers could even check to see if students' cell phones are turned off before they enter into any classroom. This would be a great opportunity also because most of the time students are texting their friends that go to the same school, making it to were it distracts not only the student sending the message but also the student receiving the message. This is another thing that you won't have to worry about if you reconsider the cell phone policy. However, if the cell phone was to goes off in class, the phone shall be taken up and cannot be brought back to school. If the student is caught with the phone on school property, the phone will be taken away and will not be given back until the end of the year under any circumstances. It will be very important to be sure to be strict when enforcing this policy, but it is well worth considering for students, teachers, and most importantly, you. Please consider the policy.

EE6DDAF8FD20,"I would go with policy 1, because there are many reasons why students would have their cell phones with them. There could have been something bad in your family and one of your parents might call to notify you what has happened, there's some kind of murderer in the school and the phones are out and cell phones are the only device to contact someone when you really need help, or you are on school grounds in a severe condition and there is no one else there to help you, you could either call for help or use your cell phone. I kind of support the use of cell phones even though I don't own one, I might ask for someone to use their's when I need to make a call. Even though these events are rare, you might not know what will happen. In my opinion, I would tell the principle to use policy 1.

If I asked all the students who have cell phones with them if they want policy 1, there would be a chance that most of them would say yes. If I asked teachers with cell phones, probably most of them would want policy 2. I have already wrote a letter to the principle before this for an assignment if students should be allowed to have cell phones, either for educational use, emergency, or at certain time periods.

I Believe policy 1 is a better choice. I think you should consider choosing policy 1 because I think students should use their cell phones during free periods or lunch. Policy 2 is a little harsh because some students will probably use their cell phones during school then get caught and have them get taken away. Policy 1 is a much better and fair policy then policy 2. Policy 1 students can only use them when they are in lunch or in any free period. If a student is using their cell phones during any other class except lunch or free periods then they should get a warning and if seen again the teachers should take them away from the students and ask the student parents to come to the school and pick it up. If a student cell phone isn't turned off during class and goes off then the teacher should give the student a warning but if it continues to go off then the teacher should take it away from the student. I also believe if the student has his/her cell phone hanging from his/her pocket the teacher shouldn't just take it away just because they see a cell phone. The teacher should only take it away if the student is using the cell phone during any class except for lunch or free period. Policy 2 is not going to work because maybe the student needs a cell phone and has to bring it into school incase the student parents call the student for emergency's. So I believe students will still bring in cell phones because their parents told them to if the principal choose policy 2. That is my opinion if the principal should consider policy 1 then policy 2.

I believe that your first policy, the one which students are allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, is the best policy of your two choices.

I believe my in my opinion because it allows students to have a sense of freedom in the school. As long as students know that, they must turn off their phones during classes, I believe there wouldn't be a problem. This is a great idea because with this, less rules are set to be broken, because students know that their conversation will be open for comments once they reach lunch or a free period. This will make students a little more patient and focused during class. Along with this it allows the students to be more social without all of the yelling and screaming throughout the hallways during their free periods and lunch time. Due to the fact, they can simply send a text message or call a friend.

Some reasons why I believe that this idea wouldn't succeed is due to the fact that some kids may not be able or ready to handle the responsibility of having a phone, and may forget to turn it off, and then have a phone ring in class. Then this will give reason to the teacher to take their phone as punishment. However, this is only an assumption.

Now my reasons for the second policy, and why it wouldn't work. I have doubts in this policy because students may need their phones for after school activities and other emergency reasons. This could often lead to kids having a hard time communicating with parents or friends when a ride is needed. I also believe that to enforce this policy you may have to go through drastic measures to enforce such a strict rule. Such as investing in a metal detector to prevent phone entry into the school, which would costs money, limiting the funds for educational purposes.

These are all of my reasons in why the first policy for students of our school is the best way to go in my opinion.

Because the students work pretty hard and deserve some time to themselves on the phone. Once they are in the class the cell phones have to be turned off or put on vibrate. Because if they are on during class it will cause a big distraction to everyone else who is trying to learn. But it is also important to have your cell phone with you in case of an emergency. For example, if the school goes on lockdown the students have to inform their parents of what's going on. Or if an after-school activity gets cancelled the student have to let their parents know ahead of time so they can try to get a ride. So if you can please take the time to consider the options it will mean a lot. Thanks for your time and have a nice day.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
F6DB5CB9682B,"I would probably agree with policy 2 because i don't think kids need their phones. Even if they can use them during lunch they will start to text during class and it would be a big problem. At our school our phones are supposed to be off and in our locker when we bring them. The thing is nobody listens to that rule. Me i don't even bother bringing my phone to school because with my luck someone will call me during class.

Like i have stated i believe kids should not be aloud to use their phones at all unless there is an emergency. This means kids can use them if there is a family emergency or any emergency.

People in my school will text during class and put their phones under the table and play games when the teachers not looking. They also will never get caught either. These are the reasons phones should not be used during school because students will take advantage of it.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

I think you should allow students to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free time as long as they keep them off during class time. The reason I think you should do this is because students will use their phones no matter what as long as the teachers don't catch them. Another reason is because a lot of people like to use their phones, and at lunch periods it is our free time to do what we want, and we can waste our time by using our cell phones instead of exercising and working all the weight off we gained from texting too much but that's our choice. The last reason I could think of is if we have no friends at our school and a lot at another we could call or text them during lunch so we don't have to socialize with a bunch of mean people we don't get along with at all. There are some reasons I could think of to not let kids use their phones during lunch like someone could run into the person who is texting and then they would drop their phone and they might get in a fight.

we the students at SCHOOL_NAME have talked it over and we would like to tell you the good reasons y having a phone at school is a good reason. first off its a way of connecting with our parents on our break time we always need something from them and need to tell them something everyone and a while so we should be allowed to have them on our break time and also if we do get phones allowed in school we will not use them in class we have all agreed to that and also we can help u out with this to if u allow phones to be in school we will be more clean on our compass and the whole school will act more appropriately in school no more running in the hall ways or acting out in class it makes us feel more responsible if we have something to hang on to and keep track of also phones now have notes in them so we students text a lot and we can just text any notes that u are trying to say to us it would b a lot easier and we can just searched them on our phones in class and we can have our notes as fast as 123 so pales give it a second thought of how the phones should b used and please let us have our phones in scroll for those many reasons that have bee n told students of SCHOOL_NAME",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

I agree with policy 1 because you can interact with your peers more and talk about hanging out after school or talk about something private. I agree with number 1 again because if your having a bad day let that friend know by texting them. I also agree with them being turned off because people could cheat on tests and stuff, but if someone comes to the school with a gun you have your phone to call the police or your parents for help.

Like our school we have to have them off all day until we get outside, when most people have them on anyway. If you get caught with your hone here they take it for two school days then your parents have to come and get it. I think we should be able to have our phones during school hours in study halls or free time because we can get to know our peers more, which is good for our social life, so your don't die alone or go being depressed.

I think that with the situation you have been put in, the best thing to do is policy 1. I believe in this policy for more then just the reason of calling people and texting or doing something else during school hours is cool. I believe they are needed only for uses before and after school and that uses during school is just you being to nice to the students here at the school.

I know personally because i am one of these people, that you need your phone before school if you get rides from other people or if you think you might be late to the bus and you need to ask you friend to see if the bus is there. Even more important then that though, if you're parents want to contact you or need to find your ride after school and you don't know where they have parked and the your principle made the choice to band you from even bringing your phone to school, then might not have a ride home or an angry parent. So if you live over 5 miles away from school like me, then that's a long walk home.

So in conclusion, i think that policy 1 is the best for this situation and i would encourage you to choose that policy to run the new cell phone rules at our school.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I hear that you are planing on changing the schools cell phone policy. I applaud you for that. I completely agree with you that our school has been having trouble with the whole cell phone thing.

I have been thinking about your two possibilities and thought I would assist you with the truthful thought of a student. Although policy two assures that no student will be tempted to text during class, I believe that policy one is the right way to go because of the fact that kids forget things and need to set reminders like you can do on a phone, also you can text your family if you forgot something and need them to bring it to you. These are some of the reasons why i believe that policy one is the better way to go.

First off, students should be allowed to have their phones at school because now a days cell phones are becoming the only way for kids to be in touch with family and friends. If students need to get a hold of their direct family they need to have their phones. If you were to go with policy two students would have no way of doing that. Trust me when i say that students should be allowed to have their phones during school hours incase of an emergency.

Then there is the fact that if student have them during lunch and other free times they will be more likely to follow the rules of turning them off during class so they don't get in trouble and wont have the privilege of being able to use them taken away as well. I know that if you were to change the policy to number two I would follow those rules very carefully. Students would enjoy following the rule if that meant that we could use them during lunch and other free times.

Lastly there is the reason of how students would be more on task. They would have already talked to their friends during free times that they would have nothing more to say and would be able to focus more on the school work. If we are more focused then we are less likely to annoy the teachers with our chatty-ness and we would be able to get further on in the curriculum then we do now.

This would be better the school and for the students.

All in all, student should be allowed to have our phones with us at school. We would be able to talk to family and friends when we needed to during free times, we would follow the rules more so that we wouldn't lose our privilege of using the phones during school hours, lastly we would not be as talkative and would be able to focus more because we would have already gotten to say what was needed to be said. So please consider what I have provided in my letter to you about why i believe policy two is the better way to go. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I believe that students should be able to bring their cell phones into the school building. I believe that they should be able to use their cell phones at lunch or a free period.

It's a good way to let the students have fun and learn at the same time . But they should not be allowed to use their cell phones in class , because this will cause a distraction to them and other students. If this become a school policy , the students might even appreciate you and other teachers for letting them use their phones and have free time . This will also be a good thing that will let the students know that you appreciate the efforts and hard work that they do whether it's an after school activity or just class work. Students may even think that , since the teachers and principal are letting us take the advantage of using our cell phones at lunch or a free period , then we should show them that we are really grateful and satisfied by working more and improving well . They might even reward you with something because this doesn't often happen at many schools. Some schools are zero tolerance and very strict. But to really make the student do their best is to give them a break or free time to show you really care. Pressuring and making the students do something won't make them want to do it. It'll just tell them that , this school is boring and say things like I don't want to go here anymore . Or maybe they won't even recommend that particular school to others. So

I believe that this is a great way to make the students think positive and say great things about your school to others and maybe they would want to join your school .",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

What i think the principal should do, allow students to bring there phones but they must be off and students can use there phones before school and after school. Students need it more after school in case they stay after school for a sport or tutoring. Students aren't supposed to take out there phones during school or during class. If a student takes it out during class the student won't concentrate on there school work. They will be on there phone more than on there school work. If its on and the teachers see it out they will take it away and your parents have to come and get it from the office. Right when the teacher takes it you can't get it back from them they will have to take it to the office. Students start getting there phones like in 6th or 7th grade. If its on and it ringers during class the teacher will say turn it off. Sometimes they will give you a warning and the second time they will take it away. Some students can't live without there phones because they always use it to text or call people. Some students don't turn off there phone they just put it on silence or vibrate. In some phones you can hear the vibrate across the room. Some students do get there phone taken away once in a while but not all the time. One of my friends kept on getting her phone taken away like every week from the same teacher and they give it up to the office and when my friend's mom came again to get the phone they told her mom, ""Your daughter can't bring electronics to school because she always gets it taken away from the teachers."" So now that she doesn't bring her phone to school she has to call her mom or her dad from the office or phone her friends phone after school.

If the students don't do that job they might be in a big problem. in SCHOOL_NAME if the students do not turn theirs phone off and it rings during class the teachers automatically will take the phone from the students.

Eventually the parents have to come and get the phone from school and give them to their kids.

If the students bring their phones to school they will text their friends, call their friends and take pictures.

In contrast if the students are doing those jobs during classes and there were no school rules the students would play with their phone during class time.

The lunch period is the period were you have a lot of free time to do what ever you want and talk with your friends that moved. There are no teachers at lunch to watch you, so you won't get caught. If you use your phone during class you well sure to be caught. Also if you use your phone in the halls you could fall and get really injured or bump into someone.

What if one parents are really sick and about to die and they die and your in school and your in the middle of class and your parents calls, but the teacher says to not pick it up, but then they try calling back at lunch and you pick up and your parent are mad and they start yelling at you and you said that you can't pick up the phone during class.

Students should be able to bring cell phones to school for many different reasons. Like in case of an emergency or going to a friends house to call your mom before she gets worried or if you left home a important project or homework you can call home and tell your mom or dad to bring it to you.

Students should be able to bring cell phones in case of emergencies like your bus broke down in the middle of the road on a field trip and you can't get home. If you could bring a cell phone you could someone to come and pick you up and maybe your friend if he or she doesn't have a cell phone to call someone. Another reason is if you walk home and you go a different way and you get lost and need help getting home you can call your mom, dad or guardian to come and pick you up from where you are by directing them where you are over the phone. The final reason is if the power goes out at school and no one is at your house you can call your mom or dad to come home. That's some reasons why we should be able to bring cell phones to school.

Here's more reasons. Say you want to go over your friend's house and you and your friend decide to do it during the day and a few hours go by and you mom gets worried and starts panicing and you get in trouble when you get home you can call your mom if you had a cell phone and you wouldn't get in trouble. That's a reason why you should have a cell phone.

The last reason is if you aren't doing good in a class there is a big project worth more than half your grade and you need that project to pass, but you forgot it. With your cell phone you can call your house and have them drop it off and you do really good on it and you get a high average because of it.

I believe that ""policy 2"" is not such a good idea because students will bring their phones to school no matter what and will disobey your idea of not bringing their cell phones. Policy 1 in my opinion is a great idea because student will b allowed to talk to there friends or call home in case of an emergency they have. When students walk into class they should place their phones in a bucket so they wont b able to use them or have the teacher make sure their phones or turned off and put of way.

The cell phone policy in schools are one of the most biggest concerns to teachers because mostly in every class there is always a student guy or girl using their cell phone to communicate with their friends to talk. this is why letting students use their cell phones during there free time in school is a good idea so they can have time to talk and text to their friends and talk what they want to talk about so they can pay attention during class instead of texting their friends during class to talk and instead pay attention.

All though policy 2 isn't such a good idea but it will teach the students to not text during school. School is to learn not to socialize only on their personal time they can. students become less smarter because they are distracted by using their cell phone to talk during school and that's how they never learn. students need to learn that there is more to life then just texting and talking on their cell phones.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Should cell phones be used? I strongly suggest we use the first policy because at lunch or snack is our free time and we should be able to use our phones.

Teachers may argue about phones going off in class but they can simply tell the students to check their phone to see if its off and if it rings in class the teachers can take it away.

They should have a small rule like if your phone rings 1 time in class then its a warning then if it rings again a different day then it gets tooken away and given at the end of the period or end of school.

7E46229A7CA5,"Dear Principal,

You are rethinking our cell phone policy, and I think it is a great idea to be asking kids their opinion.

Cell phone can sometimes be a big issue in school, so here is what I think our policy should be.

Personally, I think that students should not be able to use phones in school.

They cause a huge distraction for a large population of our school.

Many people sit in class and text, use the internet, and sometimes even try to talk to their friends on their phones.

This is distracting these kids from listening to the teacher and getting their work done. Lots of times kids do not get their work done in class and also don't do it at home.

This causes them not to learn anything.

It also distracts many people around them, having to watch someone next to them text, listen to their calls, and being asked to hide them so their teacher does not see their phone.

I think that many of the conversations that occur in school are unnecessary and could be held after school at a more appropriate time.

They usually are just texting their friends, trying to go on their favorite website, post statuses on facebook, and just plain fooling around when they should be learning.

Since the office supplies phones to call home to their parents, they should not need their cell phones to do that.

If someone needs to talk to their parent about something, it should be important enough to be able to use a school phone, and should not be texting them or calling them with their cell phone in class.

Many kids use their phones so they don't have to listen in class, they use it to give them something to do instead of paying attention to their teacher. They also sometimes do not talk about school appropriate things, and are just messing around, or trying to act cool, showing everyone that they are texting in class.

It is a big distraction when someone's cell phone starts to ring in the middle of class, and it creates a big commotion.

Allowing kids to use phones in their free time could quite possibly be a big mistake. Lots of students may abuse the new rule, and make sure they have them in every class, thinking that if they are allowed to use them in their free time, they could use them when they are supposed to be learning too.

This could also cause lots of disruptions, and could possibly cause fights.

Kids may fight over what kind of phone each other has, or what everyone is talking about, if it is not a school appropriate subject.

It would be more likely for gossip to get around in school if everyone is texting about it.

Other kids may also attempt to use the internet on their phones in class, take pictures, and could use it to cheat on tests.

I think that the cell phone policy should not allow students to use cell phones in school.

It could cause many distractions, and school should be just about learning.

Each conversation should be able to wait for a more appropriate time.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

In my school we cant use them at all except after school. It would be great to use phones at lunch but for what for we don't use them at all here.

C0DF324B581F,"Dear, whoever this may concern,

I think that we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and during free time, as long as we turn them off during class time. If we didn't bring phones to school something bad COULD happen. For example we could be walking home and somebody could be following us, phones aren't just for texting or calling our friends, they are also used for emergencies too.

first, we could get kidnapped walking home from school or walking home from the bus stop. Many kids are being taken while walking home or to a friends house. If we had cell phones at school with us then we could maybe call somebody if we are suspicious about the people in our surroundings. If we are just walking home not in a group then, we could get kidnapped.

Second if we aren't sure about our surroundings and we get lost we can call somebody to help us get to where we are going. I know that if I had just moved into a new neighborhood, and i didn't exactly where I was going, I would most likely get lost. If that was to every happen a kid or a teenager who owned a cell phone would be able to call someone for help on where to go. If we got lost we could walk to a street sign and tell the person where we are at if you can get a hold of somebody.

If we want to go somewhere after school instead of going straight home, could cal our parents to ask for permission. Some parents like to call their kids after they get out of school to make sure they are okay. cell phones are a way for a parent to get a hold of their kids. If us kids aren't home around the time we usually are the parents get worried, unless you have called them and told them that you are going to go somewhere after school. Some parents might make their kids bring their phone to school even if they aren't allowed, just to make sure that the kids are safe.

I think we should be allowed to bring cell phones to school because they are used in emergencies, such as getting kidnapped, lost, or just a way for parents to get a hold of their kids. Cell phones are important to parents just as they are to kids too.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6
1D6BF18EB6EE,"Should Cell Phones be Allowed in School?

Do you think phones should be allowed during free time in school? I think this should be something children should be able to do. If i was the principal of a school I would allow children to bring their phone devices because they might have to communicate with their parents. Some reasons why i would allow students to use their phones during lunch and other free times are they might need to get in contact with there parents if they need something or have an emergency and, it is a way to become a social person. I would only allow students to do this if their phones were turned off at all other times. I would hope students would be responsible to only use phones when allowed.

Image you were in school and you needed to get in contact with your parents desperately and, you couldn't wait until you got home but, to make it even worse you couldn't use your phone. I would feel very unconstrained and i would not be able to focus for the rest of the day. I think I would not be able to do my work or, anything that involves deep thought. But none of that would ever have to happen if you were able to use your phone. You would be able to get in contact with them and be worry free for the rest of your school day. That is an easy way to get stress of your back.

Another reason why students should be able to use their cellular devices during free time is they can become a social person. Although you may use your phone a lot out of school you can become more social in school. Say if you meet someone new and you want to exchange phone numbers but no one has paper to write each others phone numbers on. If you had your phone you can exchange phone numbers very fast. It would only take you a minute and, right there you have a new phoned number. This can make you more social because you get to meet new people in school and, you wouldn't have to meet out of school. Plus the more you might text someone the closer of friends you may become.

I think these two reasons are why a principle should allow their students to use their phones during lunch and free time. It would make people get in contact with their parents when needed and, you can make new friends. I would have faith in my students that they wouldn't use their phones during class periods.

I think the cell phone policy 1 that states ''Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time'' is was you should consider the new policy. This policy is both fair to the students and the teachers. I feel as though why should i have to leave my phone at home, if i can just turn it off during class time. Policy 2 is not fair at all. Students should have some freedom with there cell phones. The biggest concern with the phones being brought to school is that the students will have he phones out in class, and will not being paying the teacher no attention. So they feel to eliminate the problems students should just keep them at home huh? But with policy 1 it makes it so much fair for the teachers and the students. It lets the students bring there phones to school and pay attention in class at the same time.

In the video it demonstrated a lot of students using there phones in the classroom as well as the hallways. I think that in the scene where the video showed the students in class having his\her phone out is where the problem begins. If you had a policy like policy 1 you wouldn't have to worry about it. I understand that the students need discipline also but giving them the policy to have to leave there phones at home is so not fair. Letting the students know that we are giving you the privilege to bring your cell phone to school but you MUST turn them off while your in class time, or teachers have the right to convenscate them. i feel that's fair because if the students follow the rules that the phones must be off they wont have to even worry about there phones getting taking. I don't understand the problem with allowing the students to have there phones out while there at lunch or having free time. For example say if we are having a school activity such as a dance or a basketball game. Everybody doesn't enjoy these types of games\activitys. So maybe they would prefer to just sit down and maybe play a game or something on there phone. Me personality i would rather be on my phone then watch a boring basketball game but that's my opinion.

With policy 2 there are not all problems or cons with that policy. I just think that the students should have a say to. Policy 2 can eliminate a lot of problems such as the following,

-Getting your phone stolen.

-Getting it taking from a teacher for having it out.

-Not pay attention while your in class because your on it.

All of these possible problems can and might would happen but, as policy 1 states as long as they are off during class time. I think by allowing the students to bring there phones to school gives us more FREEDOM & RESPONSIBILLITY! The reason i think that is because if we could bring our phones to school knowing that if we have them out when were not suppose to then we will have consequences to face. So if we have the responsibility to bring them then we wouldn't do anything wrong. Also this is giving us more freedom",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6
50A729516950,"I think that kids don't need cell phones in school, they don't need them because they see there friends in class all day i don't think they need them at school.

Even if policy two was to go into affect kids would still bring cell phones into class and into the lunch room.

the majority of my class has a cell phone and 90 percent of them use there cell phones during school hours. The kids mainly use there cell phones to text not to call or talk to people. I think You are at school to learn not to converse with friends digitally.

If there would be a rule about cell phones at school they would have to be in your locker, and off, but the only time you would be able to use them would be to be on the bus, and before and after school.

But if that rule was instated the kids would still use them no matter what, the kids can just get away with that stuff all day.

like my friend will text and text all day and never get in trouble.

she just puts it under her desk and the teacher doesn't catch her in the act.

But there is some times that the teacher will hear it going off and she will tell them to give her the phone and she gives it back at the end of class, but if they have gotten caught with it before she will send it to the office and make the parents get it after school.

So i think that kids should just keep them in there lockers off and put away for good until they leave the premises of the school.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

CD86F7930D58,"To the school principle,

I think that policy number 1 is good because it gives a little freedom to communicate with friends. Either for a class project that needs to be done, for a favor, or just chatting. but at the same time its better only when there is free time or during lunch.

The first policy is good because like said before it can actually be for something important. it can be for a project, homework or anything school related. sometimes even just to chat with some friends. But that's where its the free time when you can not just in middle of a teachers learning.

For me personally this is a good policy. its good because it actually is a good deal for the teacher and students. It gives students the freedom to use cell phones to communicate, but during some free time they have as in to not disturb their learning process, and it lets the teacher be calm without thinking her students are using them during class.

Even if the second policy is chosen I think we should be able to use phones because if you need to find a friend and your having trouble finding him/her, and lets say its for a project, then there's going to be a problem.

But back to the first policy, you can actually help your teacher in some way by using a cell phone. Like if you have internet on your phone you can look something up for your teacher and help instead of starting up a computer or even not looking for it.

so hopefully this helps you decide which policy to choose for the school. but once again the first can really be good for students and teachers.

Now days students are all for technology. We write essays on computers, call friends for help on our cell phones, and read text books online. So I think policy one would be a better choice for our school.

A lot of parents think that cell phones are getting in the way of school, but it is the opposite. School is getting in the way of us using our cell phones. In schools every where students are sneaking text messages under the desk during class because they feel school takes up there free time, so if you allow student to use there cell phones during lunch periods it limit our use during class time.

Another reason is that cell phones keep us up to date. We hear about news happening all around the world on our cell phones. We can make sure there have not been any shootings or earth quakes that have injured our loved ones during the time we are at school. We can check the weather on the phones so we know if we need a jacket when we walk outside or if our afternoon activities have been canceled do to rain. Having a cell phone is like having a news paper.

If the school chooses policy one it can limit paper use in our community . We can enter our homework , research projects ,and even write essays on our phones. Having our cell phones will also keep us awake and thinking during the day. Students will know that the school respects their time.

We bring school into our social lives everyday. Like when we spend two hours doing our homework or studying for test. So I think we should be able to bring a little part of our social lives to school. Policy one will keep us updated about the news, keep us awake, and even help the environment.

I think that phone should be allowed to come out during lunch or any free time that we have. One reason is because when we want to meet up with people like our friends when we cannot find theme all we have to do is get out our phones and call theme. And if you let us have our phone out during our free time then you worry about us texting or using our phones during class because then our phones would be off. Also when people are trying to ask to get something that they forgot and another person is still in that spot they can call that person or text theme and ask if they can bring it for theme. For instance it could be homework that they left in class or maybe even things that belongs to theme are left in class and the person can then bring the item for theme. That's another reason why you need to get in touch with another person on your cell phones. And if you did not let us have our phones out at all then we wouldn't be able to have contact with anybody like to meet up with theme or to ask if they can kindly grab something for theme that they forgot and if they are in the same thing or item that they forgot.

I believe that students should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and free time because their cell phones will be off during learning time. They won't feel the need to have to text during class. I'm sure there will be a decrease in the amount of complaints you receive from the teachers as to how many children continue to text in their classrooms. I believe you will be happy with how the numbers will change.

Also I believe that student may get a lot more work done in class without a lot of them texting. If they have time to read their text at passing time then they won't have to stop doing their work just to read their text. I'm sure the teachers get tired of repeating themselves constantly telling the students to put their phone away. constantly taking their phone. constantly calling their parents about it.

However, there may be students that will take this experience for granted. You can take that away form them which is only fair. But I'm positive this won't happen if you make this a school policy.

As you can see a lot of students grades can increase and the class texting rate will decrease if this policy was to happen. Please think about this. It may really change the school. There will a lot of honor roll students and less detentions.

I think we should have cell phones in school all time but have to be put on silent and in your pocket.

It would be nice to use phones during lunch time and free time.

But the phones to have to be turned off during the day because we could just put them on silent and know one would if you have it on or not.

What's it going to hurt if you have it on silent or if you could use it when the teacher is not giving incrustation to the class.

Because cell is another way to communicate with you friends instead for calling them you could just text them.

Also at lunch you could just text your friends with out going over to them and talking it's much easy to do that.

If the teachers don't let you have your phone in class that's dumb because people love there cell phones and use them all the time and teachers take them away because your not supposed to have them out but if you could have them when she/he is not talking or doing a lesson so we should be allowed to use them in those reasons and if them give homework do the homework first and then use your phone as long as you have permission to use them.

So really both of them are not the greatest policy's in the world I don't agree with either one of the policy's I agree with the one I just wrote, just not having phones in school is dumb and only having them your at lunch and other free time that's boring.

Come on if the teachers have them out why cant we?

Are there just better than us and can do what they want.

So for that i think we have them out when teachers and not giving incrustations or giving out homework thank you for taking the time to read this

I think students should be allowed to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times because if someone was hurt and there wasn't an adult around they could call someone to go and help them, and if they needed something they left at home and wanted someone to drop it off and because lunch is a time for students to socialize and talk to our friends by using our cell phones.

Imagine if you got hurt and there was no adult around to help you, you would automatically want to call someone with your cell phone. Its a lot faster to use then waiting for a teacher to come help you. If you were in serious pain and needed to go to the hospital, you would go straight to your phone and call 911. Lets say you forgot your homework or your lunch, you would want to call your parents and ask them to bring it to you at school instead of going to the office and calling. Its faster and easier to use your own cell phone.

Lunch time is a time for students to be with there friends and listen to there ipods and use there cell phones to talk to each other. Lets say you needed something from a friend and they were on the whole other side of the cafeteria. It would be so much easier to call or text them. Students are usually on there phones no matter what. If there right next to each other, they will still text each other. Some students would like it if we were able to use our cell phones and others may not. But the majority of students would like to be able to use them during lunch and any other free time.

In conclusion, I think student should be able to use there cell phones during lunch and any other free time because if someone was hurt and no teacher was around to help them, they would use there cell phone and because its a good way to socialize during a free time.

2CB6039E6165,"I agree with Policy number 2. I think that cell phones should not be allowed in school, because it wouldn't really make much sense to have them during free time when you just talk to your friends face to face. Cell phones are a distraction to school work. If the school allowed students to keep their cells phones for just free times and lunch, then they probably wouldn't put them away after those times. They are a distraction, and it would keep students eyes off their homework and school work.

Student's cell phones should be used on buses, on the way home, and just your house. Not the school building. If they were to be used during free times it might just wash away all the information just learned by the student. All of school hours should be kept just school hours. No texting and calling times.

Cell phones can be a cheating tool used. During the free times the students get they can text each other the answers to tests, quizzes, and/or homework. It wouldn't matter if it's free time or lunch, it can still be accomplished during that time.

I think that the principal should just stick with the no cell phones policy, if they want their students to stay on track and do their school work.

Teachers having cell phones is okay, because they already know all this information that's why they teach it. Although, they shouldn't have it out constantly because the cell phone is just going to get in the way of teaching the class what they need to know for their future. So if the teachers are texting during class they are just ruining the students future. I wouldn't think that would happen though.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
8E0A4CFAEA9C,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I strongly believe that students should not be allowed to have their cell phones out during school hours. Students will be able to focus better, students won't be late to class, and students will not distract others.

To start off, students should not be able to have cell phones out during school hours so they can focus better. If a student is on their cell phone during class they will not be learning anything and will most likely fail. Education is very important because if you are well educated you can get a scholarship into college and have a wonderful career. But if you are not well educated you will not get any of those things and you will most likely end up getting paid minimum wage.

Furthermore, students should not be allowed to have cell phones out during school hours so they won't be late to class. If a student is tardy twice to class they will receive a detention and the next tardy after that will be a referral. Those will affect your discipline record and won't get you into college either. At school, cell phone use is just not necessary and shouldn't be tolerated at all. Also, if your are late you will have missed the class instruction and as well as some academic material needed to pass that class.

Last, students should not be allowed to have cell phones out during school hours because it can distract other students from their work. I remember this time when my class was taking an important test and one of my classmates cell phone rang and that student got a zero on that test. If a students phone rings during class another student could be distracted and waste time off of that assignment and also lose credit because the work was incomplete.

To sum it all up,

I strongly believe that a student should not be allowed to have a cell phone out during school hours so students could focus better, they will not be late to class, and they will not distract others.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6
C3F0BCBEED7D,"Change The Cell Phone Policy

Dear Principal,

I know that cell phones are a necessity to people today. Everybody has one. A lot of students think negatively of the ""no phone's rule."" Every kid that has a phone wants to change it. There are pro's and con's to each of these options. I feel like the best though, is Policy 1; allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times. I know students that can't stop texting, during class, even though phones are supposed to stay in lockers. I feel like we should be able to have phones, but we could have designated times to use them. Lunch, is not a ""class"", it is the only 40 minute break from learning students have. In the hallways is another good example, students have 4 minutes to get to class, they can spend those four minutes however they want, except for texting. That should be changed. Students may need to text mom and tell her that volleyball practice is cancelled. Or that they need gym clothes. It is much easier than running down to the office to call her. I understand that phones can be a disruption from learning.

But, students are more likely to secretly text in class if cell phones aren't allowed. And a lot of students go to their locker, or the bathroom during class just to text. So you have to think, would you rather have kids more worried about texting in class, and not learning; or, paying full attention and knowing that they can text later? A student won't feel a necessity to answer a text right away, and get off task in class, if they know they will be able to at lunch, or in the hallway. I feel that changing the cell phone rule would benefit everyone, from the students, to teachers. It can even benefit you. Teachers will be more focused on class and not worrying about taking phone's away from students. And like I mentioned before, the students won't be so worried about getting caught, and they will focus on their work.

A day with cell phone's allowed, would be a positive influence, just give it a try. Coming from a student, trust me, it will be much, much better. In conclusion I think that changing the schools cell phone policy would be a great idea.

In my opinion I choose policy 2, against cell phones. policy 2 would best fit this school , I will tell you two reasons why.

The first reason is a lot of kids steal and lose there cell phones at school and sometimes they never get them back. so to lower the rate of people losing there cell phones we should not bring are cell phones to school period.

The second reason was is that the kids at school try to talk and text during class, that is why there phones always go off. So they should keep their phone off or just not bring it to school it causes to many distractions and we can not all afford to be held back because we were to busy paying attention to are phones.

I want every kid to make good grades but they cannot do that if they try to talk or text during class. I'm not saying don't ever have a cell phone all I'm saying is to keep them away from school grounds and if some kids try to think they are cool and have there cell phone at school then they should get a referral for not obeying school rules.

But i do think that it is a good idea to have the phones out at lunch because they are not learning anything at lunch time they are only eating. so i do not see the big deal of eating and texting but i do see the big deal with texting in the classroom because that stops you from learning. Also about phones off in the class room i think you should be able to keep them on but the sound all the way off so it does not beep or anything. but i think you should be able to have it on because if there was a fire and you needed to call your mom right away to pick you up then that is pretty important.

so i do agree with the first one because how much harm can a kid do with texting and eating lunch. so you might think that it is a bad idea and go with what you want but i really do think that there will be no harm done if you allowed them to get there phones out for lunch. also if you let them come to lunch with phones they will be more willing to not take there phones out during class",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I suggest you go with policy 1 that will allow student to use their phone in school as long as it is off during class. This policy will cut down on the rates of people texting during class and maybe even bring some peoples grades up because they wont forget their work and can ask somebody to get it for them. It would reward the students for there hard work and their attention in class. There would be no more sneaking phones into class texting while the teacher is not looking. that way the can focus on their class work and they can understand it and get a good grade.

If you went with policy 2 then kids would sneak their phones into class and instead of focusing on their work their focusing on not getting caught. So now they don't how to do there homework and fail a test. If their not aloud to have phones at school then what will they do if they need to talk to their parents after school, or need to get a ride with friends. phone are almost a nessicty kids need to help them with school and other things out side of school.

I think that you should allow Policy 1 for our school. Policy 1 is having phones at school but not using them during class periods. Students should be able to have cell phones. Every student has a right to bring a cell phone, but they won't use them during class because that's not one of their rights. Cell phones can be used as an emergency. If a student has an emergency, they cant use their cell phone because of Policy 2. If you consider Policy 1, then a student will be able to use their phone if an emergency occurred. If a student comes home alone and they see an unfamiliar car in their drive way or something, they can't use their phone because you wouldn't let them due to Policy 2. With Policy 1, the student can call their parents or parent and tell them and the parents would tell them what to do.

Some students express themselves through a phone. If they don't have it, they don't know what to do. If you tell them that they can have it but only during lunch and free time, they will be fine then. Everyone will have the right to bring their phone but they also have the right not to bring it. In Policy 2, students can't bring their phone at all. In Policy 1, students at least have choices about what they can do.

I agree that some students may be using them during class and they should not have the privilege to use them anymore in school. The thing is, what if students weren't using them during class and couldn't bring them anymore. Then, they can't use them at all even though they didn't in the first place and others got cell phones taken away from them.

I agree that there should be a stop to students using them during class. I was thinking, if students get caught using them, they would have to do community service for a day to help the community get clean and they will know not to do it again. Many of your students are dedicated to their phone and need it, but if they make the wrong decision and use it during class, then you can tell them they can't use it anymore during free time and lunch. If a student keeps breaking and breaking the rules, then I think you can take the phone away from them and, like I said before, give them community service. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you agree with me and consider Policy 1.

Other than that I think that you can have your phones out at lunch and free period cause you are not learning anything at those specific times. During lunch you are already socializing so why not let our phones be out cause that is socializing to except it is on a phone and not talk to your friends and passing note to them also. Almost every one has phones what is the point of having them if you can not use them out side of our core classes and related arts. If we are in free period and lunch I thing the should be expectable. We learn all day and sometimes we just need a break. I think that our phones relive stress cause you are thinking about your phone not what is going on like drama and grades. I am one of the people that always keep their phone in my locker unless it is a field trip or you are able to have our phones out.

Some of our teachers keep their phone on and out on their desk.

If we are not aloud to have our phones out in class they should be aloud to do it either. It is like taunting us like saying we can have our phones out and you can't over and over. When they use them during class really irritates me because they are supposed to be teaching and we are supposed to be listening and learning. Half of my teachers do this and I wish they wouldn't cause if they are not at school to teach then why are they here wasting my time and wasting theirs too? That is a concept that just blows my mind. So just allowing to have our phones out during lunch and free periods will take our mind of all the stress and drama that goes on thro out the days at school. Whether it be at home with home work or at school I think we should be allowed to have these devices out for a less stressful day of school don't you?

Students should bring their cell phones to school and only use them during free periods and lunchtime because using phones is important; it's used for emergencies, calling other people that are in different places, and chatting with your friends from separate places. Cell phones are the important devices that are ever invented, and they are used to save on trees. Back then, people had to write letters and send them to their friends, family, and businesses.

Cell phones may cost a lot of money, but they're important to use, and you can call your parents from school if you are getting ill, and you want to use your own phone instead of the nurses' phone. Cell phones are like travel phones, you can keep them in your pocket when traveling and use them just in case you need them. I know that cell phones may be obnoxious to use during school since they have ring tones, but they are useful.

Cell phones are the new telephones, because telephones are at-home phones, and you can't take them with you when you are traveling, and besides, telephones are getting old and people would want to have a device in their pocket while in public. Telephones might have more messages than a cell phone, because people are barely home and they might have longer work shifts.

When people are at work, they are wondering who's calling them on their telephones and they might worry that they missed a call. People who are at work might be thinking about getting a cell phone instead of worrying about their telephone from home. We know that people don't like missing important calls, and they hate checking their messages. Telephones aren't made for texting like cell phones are.

Students may also want to check appointments on their own when using their cell phone, so their parents won't have to remind them about scheduled appointments, and they can remind themselves on their own. Students may want to use a calculator in their free time while using their cell phone; cell phones also have a calculator program so students won't have to bring in their own calculator when doing homework in free time, and they can just use the calculator on their cell phone.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
B9B8F5E753FB,"Dear Principal,

I believe that your Policy 1 is better than your Policy 2. I think this because cell phones can be very helpful in unexpected times of emergency and/or other situations. For example, if something were to happen to a student, whether personal or bad, and the office was not available than the student could use their cell phone. Another reason is that this gives students an opportunity to communicate with other siblings or friends that do not go to the same school. Also, if there was an emergency involving another family member or close family friend, it would be easier to contact the student with the cell phone especially if it was a very personal family matter. If the students were not allowed to have cell phones in school at all and let's say, for a student, plans had changed for who was picking he/she up and it was decided by the parents after school was out. How would they contact him/her to let them know? Also, how would that student know how to deal with the situation? Cell phones help kids stay aware and figure out how to handle certain things that come their way during their days at school. So, from all this I think that kids should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. But, only as long as they keep them off and in their lockers or book bags during all class hours.

I think policy two is the best idea ,you should not let students have there cell phones in school at all. I think this because this could be a big distraction to the students, they may disobey the rules and use them in class, and also because they could send answers to a important test through a text.

When students use there phone that is mainly what they focus on when they are talking on the phone or texting . They may get in trouble using there phones because they are so distracted. For example say a student gets in trouble for using there phone's when a teacher is trying to talk to them. Cell phones could get students in to big trouble! I know when i am using my phone it is mainly what i focus on. Parents send there children to school to learn not be on there cell phones they can do that at home, cell phones are a bad idea!

Most school's do not allow students to use there cell phones because they are in school and don't need to but they always catch someone disobeying the rules and using it in class. We don't want this to happen when students should be paying attention to the teacher not on there cell phones.

You should strongly pressure students to leave there cell phones in there lockers and if they don't banded the cell phones to let them no that you are very serious about this and do not want cell phones during school hours.

Now think about it if you let students have there cell phones with them and use them out of class some may use them in class. For example what if you are having a big test and need everyone to do well to pass the class, say one person really doesn't want to study and needs a good grade to pass the class they may ask another student in the class to send them the answers to the test through a text! This is one thing that could happen we do not want this!

Now do you think cell phones are a bad idea during school hours, school is a time for learning not for focusing on your cell phones so i would strongly say that cell phones are a bad idea for three important reasons cell phones could be a big distraction to the students, they may disobey the rules and use them in class, and they can also send answers to an important test through a text.

920E71AABE39,"Policy 1:

My idea might become true. I want cell phones during free times at school. Like at lunch time, passing period and any other free time. If we could text during our free time we could plan events for after school with parents. Also just ask other students what homework do we have in different classes through out the day.

If we have cell phones during free times. The students would be more socially active. Also we could use math and other applications on our phones to help use with our homework. This would improve homework scores and other types of work in our classes through out the day. That can help

The places we can have our cell phones out. One place is at lunch. We spend about 30 minutes at lunch. I always see people doing homework when i am eating. So if we could use cell phones at lunch then we could use the built in calculator on our phones to help use work out problems.

Another place would be our passing period. this is where we can socialize with other class mates that we cant talk to because our locker is so far away from their locker. Also we could talk to parents about school events after school. Like if we had practice after school but coach didn't tell us. then we could text our parents and tell them. That is a very good reason to have cell phones.

Now there is a problem with it. What if people over use the privilege and use there phones during class time. Well here is the solution, right before class everyone takes out there phones and turns them off. Then they will give them to there teacher and she will put them in a box on her desk. But if you don't you stand a risk. If you get caught then you will have a Friday school, and also a letter grade taken down.

The schools in America need to let students have their phones during school. If they do they can get better scores on homework and other activities. The can be social with other people. Parents can know what their kid is doing after school and during school. This is a great idea and shouldn't be put aside, that is why i am writing this. So i go for policy 1.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Do not take cell phone away, I think that policy 1 is the better choice for three reason and i will tell you them reasons in this letter. The first reason is that students need their phones to be able to get a hold of their parents if its an emergency or they need to tell them something important. The second reason is that the phone can be used for many reason, hear is one example, if u don't have or forget your calculator your phone can be used as a calculator. The third reason is that if the office or a teacher need to get a hold of a your parents or another family member, but they don't have that persons number you can give them the number from your contact list in your phone. So mainly what i'm trying to say is that cell phones are important so please don't ban cell phone privileges

9C9A7F516514,"What I think about policy 1 is that it is good and bad because for the principle he would might think that it would make the teens safer for them to contact some one if their in some type of trouble, the bad thing about this is that the students will be more focused on their cell phones in class to check for a text message. Even if the school policy says turn off your cell phones they would not listen they would just say that they did turn off their phones, the trick for teens is that they would set their phone on silence or on vibrate. So personally i think the policy for getting rid of cell phones should not be a suggestion on the principle mind at all because how will we contact our parents or contact friends or even teacher so we know when our project or homework is due. The policy or the school district just think that we text for fun that is true but we also depend on it to keep tab's on what's going on with the school or when will the next pep rally began that's why it is so important to have phones in school we teens don't take it for granted, but for our safety in school or were ever we go and always have school information with us.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
280F4A13DE2B,"I think the principle should go with option of letting us use are phones during lunch and the other school brake times instead of the option of not having phones at school at all. Many of the students have there own cell phone and some students might need it for different occasion's to communicate with are family, parents, or guardian. An example would be me i needed my phone to contact my parents during are lock down that happened not to long ago, i sent them a message from my phone to tell them ""mom we are on lock down so i cant leave the school i don't know what time we will be out ill call or message you when its ok for us to leave"" that really helped me to communicate with my parents and if the principle went with the option of not having phones at school there probably wouldn't have been any way to have told my parents we were on lock down. I think going with the option of using phones during lunch is a good idea, it might even stop students from using there phones during class when there not suppose to, knowing as soon as there done with class and they leave they have time to communicate with friends or family. It can help students grades and can stop students from not paying attention to the lesson or teacher while they use there phones. Students would enjoy using there phones and knowing they don't have to hide it or get in trouble for using there phones during a break.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

The policy you should consider is the first policy. That is because in the second policy it says ""

Do not allow students to have phones at school at all"". That is not a good idea because an emergency can happen and if the students do not a phone and there is no one around the students wont have any way to call for help. The first policy is a good idea because it allows the student to have there phones and use during lunch and other free times. The catch is during class time the phones must be turned off. The reason policy one is a good chose is because when there is free time the students have nothing to do so they get bored but if they have there phones with them they wont be bored during lunch or those other times where they have free times. If students don't have phones , how will the students parents know were they are. On the other hand if the student have a phone the parent of the student will know were they are or who they are with and what are they doing. it is also a bad thing to have a phone because if a student looses a phone the student will make a big scene but if the student is careful enough they can keep there phone safe. the first policy allows student to use there phones during free periods but there is a catch , and that catch is that when the students have class the phones must be turned off. That is good because if you allow them to use there phones during free periods they will be satisfied so when the go back to class the have it off but they don't have to use it during class and be distracted",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I believe that we should be aloud to have phones during lunch because well people have them out anyway. Were also kids we love to text and sometimes talk to our parents or grandparents or someone like that. Some students may also be shy to talk to the people who go to our school. Its just something that takes some time to find out

I also agree that we shouldn't because well harassment could go on or people could tell there friends to bring a gun or something to school or even drugs. Yea it is fun to have our phones out but we don't need to focus our lives on phones some people around the countrys aren't lucky enough to have phones.

I say people shouldn't waist there time on phones get out and do something. There are allot of people who cant move a bone in there body we should be thankful we can. God gave us gifts one of my gifts is softball and gymnastics those sports i love doing but you cant do them with a phone in your hand. well you could but it would be hard of dangerous.

Phones have got ton me in trouble may many of times. One year i was playing softball worming up the pitchers arm for the game i didn't have any gear on not even a face mask to protect my face well my phone rang in my pocket and i was so exited to see what it was. So i looked at the text well the pitcher didn't know that at the time she pitched it and it hit me right in the eye knocked off my glasses and gave me a black eye.

So, i mean there are many good things about it and many bad things you just have to be smart about what you do. Many people already text in school but teachers done know that and yes there has been rude comets on them but its part of life.

You are our principal and we respect you, you've made great disitions for us just keep shooting them out at us were ready for you.

ED6E36CAFB74,"I believe policy 1 is better because a lot of people may have very important reasons for using their cell phones such as calling their parents or family members because they maybe sick or any other personal things and they want to stay in touch to make sure they are okay. Other possible reasons could be is maybe they forgot something at home like their homework or lunch that they need for school and they need their parents could come and drop it off for them.

There are many other reasons we should be able to use them but not as important such as maybe changing plans as for getting picked up with their friends which isn't really bad because they just want to check in with their parents to see if its okay. i think we should be able to use our cell phones for certain reasons or even just because its fun as long as we don't use them during class time.

Of coarse Policy 2 isn't wrong because many kids use their cell phones for wrong reasons such as picking fights and texting during class and using them to cheat on test which is wrong but I really think its very reasonable for us to be able to use our cell phones because the important reasons are more likely than the negative reasons.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
B8E0146FEFD9,"Dear Principal,

Students should not be allowed to have their phones out at school at all. Phones are a distraction that can easily be abused on school grounds. For a the sake of everyone, they should be left at home.

The number one reason not to have phones at school, or even have them for free time, is the fact that they will be abused. Once you tell them that they can have their phones for free time, they will do that, plus they will also have them out during the non permitted times. Students will have them out in class texting their friends just because they all have their phones at school.

Also think about the fact that some student might slip an inappropriate text about someone in. That student will get in trouble because they did it on school grounds.

If all of the cell phones were at home, the students wouldn't have a phone to text with.

Another reason is the unsocial aspect of a phone. If the students have already been granted with free time, why do they need the phones. They can just as easily talk to their friends during free time as they can text them. In this modern world kids are already unsocial enough, so don't encourage texting by letting them bring their phones to school. You might have heard of or even seen the classic teenager at dinner with their family texting. They are being antisocial and not talking to their family. Do you really want that at school?

Also, think about the school. If a student looses their phone, or someone steals it, he/she will be upset and blame the school. Well it isn't really the school's fault, or is it. The school allowed the students to bring them to school, so why shouldn't it be blamed for the financial loss.

Everyone knows phones are distractions. If a kid goes to class with a certain text that so and so said in their mind still, they won't be able to concentrate. If the student maybe even brought their phone to class because he/she didn't finish their conversation, they surely won't being paying attention to the teacher. The students are at school to learn, not to have social time. They already have enough time after school.

I know the school faculty might say that they can enforce the rules, and even the student's might say they will behave with their phones, but I know teenagers always find ways around rules and abuse them. I know the faculty doesn't want to waste their time cleaning up the mess that phones would leave.

In summary, phones are an unneeded distraction for teenage students in the classroom and at school. If allowed at school they would surely cause more harm than good. To keep it simple on everyone they should be left at home.

A858CDE91A41,I believe the first policy works best because students need their cell phones to reach their parents and/or guardians in case of emergency . This is also true because students spend most of their awake hours at school so they need to keep their parents updated on what's going on at school . Not only that the new thing on cell phones is internet and students need the internet to work on projects . Cell phones come in handy also to tell your friends not go to science class today because we are in the lab so go to the lab . Without cell phones i bet the student home work turn in rate goes down considering some students don't have a computer at home much less internet. Cell phones are always helping students weather its telling your parents theirs something wrong at school or telling your friend that science class is in the lab today so they don't go to the science class room go to the lab or even a student trying to use the internet to finish an assignment in which you need the internet for it proves very helpful .The bottom line is if teachers can use them then the students can.,2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
9BBEDD9BD0C9,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should choose her first policy, allowing student to bring there cell phones to school as long as they are off during class. I like that idea because it gives students a chance to be free and it will help students relax more in school if they had more freedom. If students are always under some type of strict rules it causes more problems in the learning place. Policy 2 would cause the students to sneak and bring their phones. If they are caught with them most likely the teacher will stop the whole learning process just over a little phone but if they were allowed to use them during free time they wouldn't have to sneak and interupt the learning process. The student will be happy to come to school and feel a little free instead of feeling like they are prisoners. It will help everybody work better including the teachers. They won't have to worry about students not listening to them trying to text because they can just wait til their free time. This also allows teachers to relax and chill incase they need to talk on their phones. Now incase a student breaks the rule of policy 1 i think they should be punished not the whole school because it would cause a problem. The students would complain and no teacher wants to here that.

9BEBB7FDB6A5,"I think that they should let us bring cell phones to school if it is off during class. We can use it during lunch and recess. It would be better for us with out interrupting class because, they go off in class. People love to talk, text, and get on the internet. They can do all that on their phones and it will also pass the time. We don't always go to recess because, they can only dismiss so many students to the gym when it is raining outside. When we are in for recess we can use our cell phones to do things. We may even need to use it for an emergency.

Now that i got the positive out of the way lets think about the negative. Students may forget to turn off their phones and may interrupt class. Their phone could get lost or stolen. They could get grounded for loosing their phone. They could be texting in class and get their phone taken away and make their parent come and pick it up. All these things don't happen very often though.

Now that we have seen the positives and the negatives there are more positives than negatives. There are several good things and very few bad things. So there should be phones in school.

6B4CAB939463,"When considering cell phones in school, policy number 1 is the best choice. Letting student use their phones in free periods/time is further the better choice. Student will feel trapped with choice number 2. They will feel as though they must hide their phones, and the consequences will be much worse. You may think that policy number 2 is better, but its not. Policy number 1 is, here are some reasons why.

When teachers find students using phones during class they believe it is because they simply do not want to pay attention. They see it as disrespect, therefore it is untollerated. The end result is the phone being taken away. teachers think that this solves the problem, but in the end this only worsens it. Everyday period, after period, someone loses their phones. Weather it is because of texting, phone calls etc. is not the point. We want you to greatly listen and understand to the points we have on this problem.

Teachers don't see why we may be truly using our phones. They do not have any knowledge of what goes on outside of school. Maybe the fact is we are waiting on information of a loved one, or a response from someone that has not been communicated with in a long time. We do not always use our phones for selfish reasons. Phones sometimes truly are the only meaning of communication between families. Teachers have to see that.

Teachers also think that more phones mean more possible theft. This is not true, if one is bringing a personal belonging such as a phone, we will be protecting it. Teachers have to give us those minutes of free time for our phone needs. Time in which we are allowed to use phones could possibly eliminate these problems all together. We strongly advise you to consider these points, and honestly think about whats betteer for everyone.      ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I really enjoy having my cell phone with me all the time. I think that the first policy is better. Almost everyone in school has some type of phone. I've seen many students trying to text in class. They are always trying to hide their phones from teachers. By letting us use our cell phones during lunch period and other free times it'll really help. Students need a time to text and it'll stop students from texting in class and students will start acting better.

Students really need a time to socialize and talk to friends. They might talk to friends in school but they also want to text. I think that if you let us text during free time it'll keep us from getting in trouble. We don't have nothing else to do during lunch time except eat and if we text during lunch is not going to affect our learning and there is nothing wrong with that.

Trouble. trouble, trouble. Many students will stop getting in so much trouble. During lunch time a lot of students throw food and mess around with other students. By letting us text students will be much more entertained by their phones and the trouble is gone. They will also stop texting during class because all they want to do is text for like ten minutes and that's it. You won't have to have a lot of phones in the office any more.

Since students know that they've had their time to text I think that they will start acting better. Students will not be walking and messing with people in the hallways. I think they will go to class and be ready to learn and then they'll get their free time to text or something.

As you see I think that if you approve that policy it'll really help the school and the students. Many students will do better in class because they'll pay more attention instead of trying to text and pay attention at the same time. I hope you approve this policy, thank you.

I believe that Policy 1 should be the policy that is used in schools.

Phones can be a distraction but if used write they can be useful and helpful pieces of technology.

Cell phones can be good tools if used correctly you can call someone to get you out of a bad situation.

They can even save your life if you get in a really bad situation.

There could be major issues if you don't let students have cell phones.

Someone could get lost and have no way to contact a parent.

What if they absolutely needed to contact a parent and there wasn't a phone around.

Cell phones make it easier to contact friends, family, and others anywhere they are.

There would be little to nothing good about not letting students not have cell phones at school.

Most people now have a cell phone.

Most teens have cell phones.

They are useful, and helpful and can be used for various things.

They are helpful and do more good than bad.

There is no reason to not be allowed to carry one if they follow the rules.

Most kids use them responsively and for the ones who don't well then there can be punishment.

There is no need to make them not allowed

There really isn't a reason not to have them.

If they can't use them during class then there's no problem.

If there not allowed then kids are still going the bring them.

I know you have a hard chose at hand and here is maybe some thing to make that chose better. Out of the two policy's I think that policy number one is the one you should chose. Because you would give the students a little bit more freedom to there own lives. And also there are some time situation where students many need to talk to someone or they need to make plans to do something important. Such as one of the rare a cations such as a death of a family member or a close friend. But also it might be some thing different and happens often such as they forgot a project or assignment at home and they need some to pick it up or e-mail it to them so they can get it in on time. Or it could be some is lost or trapped some where in need to call for help of a friend or in series case the police or fire department. Even this thoughts seem very far fetched they can is still possible they can become true.

I have been hearing from teachers and students that you are considering to make the new rule about cell phones at the school.

I'm writing this letter today to tell you that it would be the best rule to let students have cell phones out during lunch.

Many people are probably writing you a letter but if you are reading this you wont be disappointed.

First, cell phones can be used during classes and be helpful for the learning environment. A lot of students could use their cell phones for different things but students could use their cell phones as a calculator if they don't have their own. Also, students could use a cell phone to time something like in Science when you are doing a lab and need to time something.

And, if the teacher asked you what time it is in New York you could be the first to know because you would have your cell phone in use with times all over the world.

Second, many of people who don't have any thing to do after they finish their work could use their cell phone to keep them selves occupied and quite.

After a student is done with their work they could start to get loud and be annoying to the other class mates but if cell phones were allowed then the student could just play around on their cell phone quietly.

And, lots of students can concentrate better if they could listen to music while they work.

And, I my self think that it is a lot easier to think when I can hear music that I like.

Third, there is a few students that might say they would not want cell phones to be allowed in school because they can be very distracting in lots of ways. If cell phones were allowed at school they would not be ringing during class because students would turn their cell phones off or put them on silent or vibrate mode.

And if you would allow cell phones I as a student writing to you will promise that i would never take my cell phone out during class unless i had the permission to and maybe to see what time it is the faster way.

Many students and teachers have been talking about allowing cell phones to be taken out during lunch.

It was a great opportunity for me to write this letter to you explaining why I think it would be a great thing for cell phones to be allowed at school.

Thank you for taking time out of your schedule to read this letter that I wrote just for you.

The use of phones at school lunch is good for the students both educationally and socially. With the use of phones at school students could be more socially and educationally active. If you let students use phones at lunch their is less chance they will be using there phones in class.

If you let the students at least once a day bring out their phones there will be a happy student body at this school. A happy student body is important because if the student body is not happy their is a chance the students are more likely to break rules.

In addition if the students forget their work they could call their parents to bring their work to school. Did i mention students could then use up their time socializing and getting more efficient with technology.

I ask you on behalf of the student body to let the students of this school to bring their cell phones and use it at lunch period. To have an A plus school you must have an A plus student body.

I personally believe that if students brought their cell-phones to school and were able to use them during lunch and other free opportunities that this would be best. It would be best because students could call their families, and if they had them out at lunch they would not use them in class, also students would be better listeners. Students in the end that listen better, are better students.

If students were aloud to have their phones out during lunch and free periods it would be best because they could call their families. this would be nice because they could ask if they would ride the bus after school or if their parents would pick them up. Also, if a student plays sports for the school they could call their parents if practice or a game was canceled. This I believe would be an over all good idea.

Secondly, if students were aloud to have their cell phones out at lunch they would most likely not use them in class. The reason being for this is that students could get everything they wanted done at lunch. There they could text or call their friends and family. The ending result being that the teacher would have better listeners and less distractions.

Lastly I believe that if students were aloud to use cell phones at lunch you have a distraction free environment. Students could actually get their work in class done and would understand subjects better. The teacher would also not have to repeat things more than once. All in all this is a great idea.

In conclusion I believe that if students were aloud to use phones during lunch and other free times they would be less of a distraction. Students could first, call their families, second, most likely not use them in class, and third, students would be better listeners. So in the end, this is my belief.

I've heard that you're reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I've also heard that you have two possible options, one being that you allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times if they have the phones turned off during class. Two being that the students don't bring them at all. In my opinion option one is a better choice.

I know you're probably thinking that option two is better but the kids are just going to bring their phones anyway. They would also still use their phones when the teacher walks out of the room. If you let them use them during lunch and free time then they might respect that instead of not being aloud to have their phones at all. They might even start working harder because they'll have something to look forward to when they go to lunch.

Some bad things about option one might be that the kids get distracted because thy have their phone in their pocket. They might also be tempted to turn on their phone and text somebody. Also they could already have their phone on and get a text from their friend. They could even get hyped up because they're excited about having phones in school.

Considering the two cell phone policies, I personally think the first policy that allow students bring cell phones and use them during free time is better. Parents gave cell phones to their children because they want to know about how their children are doing at school; did their children get to school safely; and keep contacts with their children. Therefore, children need to bring a cell phone to school, to tell parents they got to school safety, so parents don't have to worry all day.

If their is an emergency that children need to call their parents or family members, cell phones are the easiest and fastest way to contact them.

However cell phones should be turn off during class time, because they are distractive not only to one person, also to the whole class, it interrupted the teacher or the students and wasted some class time for students to learn. For example, if 30 people's cell phones ring at the same time and everyone picks up their phones, then the entire class period is wasted.

As you can see, cell phones should be turn off during class times in order for the students to learn things using the entire class periods.

Most teens today have a cell phone, there are all sorts of cell phones who designed for teens who like to text, teens who like to go on internet on their phones, and teens who love to talk on a phone with friends. Cell phone is a easy, fast, and fun way to communicate with others. Students should have to right to do what they want. Also, talking texting, and do whatever they want on cell phones enjoying their free times and lunch periods do not effect others from what they are doing.

Over all, The first policy is the most suitable policy for the school, because students can bring cell phones to keep contacts with their parents to let them know that students are safely arrive school every morning, so they have the peace in mind to focus on their works. However, cell phones should be turn off during class periods, because it is distractive to the class, and keep others from learning. Also, students should use their cell phones during their free times and lunch periods, because it is a way to enjoy their lives without distracting others.

3CA61DE9B5C6,"Cell phones today are generally used for many reasons. They may be used for texting, calling, emergencies, and many more reasons. Shocking but true, in this day in time, people need cell phones. Some may be against this matter, but do they know everything besides teens texting everywhere they go? Cell phones are one of the major ways of communicating. Students should be allowed to obtain cell phones during school hours, and also be allowed to use them during free periods.

First and foremost, cell phones are a major way of communicating. Students may need to communicate with parents, siblings, and other students. Calling your parent for a quick minute or two may secure your way of getting home or even to obtain a book you might have left at home for your next class. Also, talking to other classmates throughout your school may give you extra time to study with them or to finish a couple of assignments you were unsure about or needed help on. Communicating with cell phones will provide you extra time to do this by sending a text or giving them a quick call, after all lunch time and free periods don't last forever. This takes less time and gives you extra time for many other priorities you may have.

Also, students need a little free time during the school day. If time is given to them to have their cell phones out and to check what they need to, students may not be prompted to sneak a text in class. Eight out of ten schools who allowed students to have their phone out at a specific time of day saw a decrease in the number of phones out during class time. Giving students this time will show that you trust them to do what they are supposed to in class. Plus, students may realize administrators trust them to keep their phones off and in their pockets during class.

Therefore, providing trust is a key to students. Showing them they have trust may provide the whole school with many other positive characteristics. Students may feel they are being rewarded with a little free time by having their cell phones out. If this opportunity is given 99% of students may do better in school. Many may think this just gives students a way to have their cell phones out without getting in trouble for it. However, students are actually very responsible and may do the right thing.

All in all, changing the cell phone policy will benefit the school in various ways. There needs to be a sense of trust and knowing they have responsibility inside them first. Students aren't always going to do the right thing. However, giving them this time will allow them to escape and talk with friends that they may not see everyday. This new policy will provide everyone with many opportunities that will have a positive effect.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8

It is my belief that if the students are given more freedoms instead of just restrictions it will reduce the chance of them violating the rules of the school on cell phones. It will also allow students to get their ambitions of telling the friends or peers something that the student wants to tell, but normally on a no cell phone policy would not allow unless they use theirs phones. Policy 1 would minimize the chances of a students losing focus during class time because of a desire to speak or communicate with their friends. Policy one would allow schools to still monitor cell phone use without losing control over it. The teacher will still be able to teach the students without worrying about someone not paying attention to them and their teachings. The administrators would still be able to do their jobs.

You are probably thinking that if policy 1 is approved students would still use their cell phones on class even thought they have total freedom to us the phone during breaks and lunch periods. Yes there is the risk of students still using their phones in class but what would life be without risks. Life would be boring and dull. Someone once told me it is better to live with freedom and danger than to live suppressed and safe. In my opinion Policy 1 would be the better decision it balances the rights of the school and the rights of the students.

I think that policy 1 should be our rule. What happens if one of our family members got hurt or going to die. We should know all the updates that is going on. Principal or any other adult shouldn't take our phones right away they should give us a waring. If they are going to take the phone at least give it back at the end of school or class. If a parent cant pick the phone up give it to the student cause the parent isn't going to be able to pick it up. If u pay for the phone and pay for the bills then you are the only one that can have possession of the phone and no one can take it away from you.

The policy and the school should have a vote to have what policy in and out of our school. The voting should be base on our choice. The school doesn't pay for the bills so why should they take it away from us.

42B977C6E77F,"I think Policy 1 would be a better policy then Policy 2. Policy 2 is a good policy to have at a school, but Policy 1 could be easier and safer. Both of the policies are a good thing to do for the school, but sometimes Policy 2 could be a lot harder to handle at a school.

Policy one would be a good policy because some kids do need phones at school. Some kids might walk home, and if there is an emergency they can be able to call whoever they need to call. In some cases, the child could be staying after school and the mother might have forgot and the mother would've been able to call. Policy 1 is exceptionally fair for kids too. kids can have their phones on during lunch but they have to turn it off during class. If kids turn their phones off during class there wont be any disruptions and everything will be okay. Another thing about Policy 1 is that if people respect the rules and don't text during class they wont get their phones taken away as much.

Policy 2 would be a good policy too, but not as good as Policy 1. If kids walk home and have an emergency, what are they supposed to do? kids should always have their cell phones with them just in case something bad like that happens. Also if there aren't to be phones at school then kids would try to sneak phones into school. If kids sneak phones into school a lot more kids would get in trouble. So it might be more stress on the school and the teacher to look out for phones instead of not paying attention to what they are teaching.

Like I said before, I do think both of the policies are good, but which ever one is better for student and their safety should be better for the school. Policy 1 would definitely be a better policy then Policy 2.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I believe that students should have the first policy. Students should only use their cell phones during their free time. During class they should be turned off so that they won't distract other students. We should have cell phones at school because if after school the buss left or an emergency and no one is around well you have your cell phone and you could call your parents. Some people think that's wrong to have a cell phone at school but we think it's okay. If you don't use it during class that's okay. Some students use their phones during class. If students just would use their cell phones and other distractive things only during lunch or in their free time it would be less distractive to everybody. Another reason why we should have cell phones at school it could be because what if your mom or dad ain't home and after school you don't know where to go or what to do. That's a reason why some people take their cell phones to school. Not everybody takes cell phones to school. Some parents think taking a phone to school is wrong. But we give the same reasons why we have cell phones to them. I hope you change your mind and you can give us a privilege to have are cell phones in school but not use them during class time. If you see someone using their cell phones during class time you should take them away and don't give that person any other privilege. Thank you for giving up your time and reading my letter.

If students agree to turn them off during class then I don't see what the problem is. If students are not given the right to take their phones to school then that will surely cause commotion and controversy. If students bring their phones to school then they must understand to only use them on their leisure time. Clearly, allowing students to bring their phone to school because it will encourage students to be responsible to not use their phones in class, students may need to make an emergency phone call, and policy 1 would please everybody.

To begin with, the principle should allow students to bring their phones to school because it will encourage students to be responsible to not use their phones in class. This will also encourage students to have self control. For example, if students bring their phones then they will learn to not use it in class or suffer the consequences.

I believe we should be able to use our phones for various reasons. Some like, we would be able to communicate with our parents when we are at school, we would be able to communicate with our friends, and we would like to come to school more because we can use our phones. Students will be happy to hear that we can text or call during school.

Their are many reasons why I want to persuade you to let us use our phones during school. One reason is, we would be able to communicate with our parents. Sometimes our parents have to tell us something and they call us but we can answer because we are at school. Other times our parents tell us we have to walk home and then again, they cant because we are at school.

Therefore we should be allowed to use our phones during school.

Second many students like to communicate and keep in touch with their friends. We like to text our friends 24/7 but yet we cant because we are at school and we have to turn our phones off. We should be allowed to have our phones and use them to talk to our friend. Even sometimes when your school is big and you can find your friend you should be allowed to call(text) them to find them. to conclude we should be able to have our phones off.

The last reason i will state, is we should be allowed to have our phones on at school because, we would like to come to school, because at our age our phone is our best friend and if we don't have it we wouldn't like to come. We like to have our phone to communicate. We would be interested in school knowing we can use our phones.

To conclude, we should be allowed to have our phones on during lunch and brunch, free time. We should have them on because we can communicate with our friends, we can communicate with our parents, and we would want to come to school. Therefore I hope you can go with the policy to let us have our phone on during brunch, lunch and free time.

In my honest opinion i think we should we should use policy 1 because its great idea. And its also reasonable how we have to turn it off during class time is good too cause we need to focus on our school work. Many students in my school would like for policy 1 to be accepted.

We should be able to use our phones during lunch periods and other free times because if teachers get to do so then we can't us students either. I think that's not very fair because the rules should apply to everyone at the school don't you think? And teachers not only are able to use their phones on their free time but do it other times too which really isn't good but i think this isn't fair how they get to use their phones on their free time and we don't.

I think its a great idea how policy 1 said we can use our phones in lunch but need to turn it off during class time. Education always comes first so that rule i truly respect but it isn't a bad rule anyway. I know like 90% of the students in the school would so follow this rule because the fact that we have the advantage to use the phones during lunch periods and other free time they would follow this rule just so we are able to use phones at lunch.

Probably about 70% of the teachers in the school will highly agree to this policy because since the students are able to use the phones in lunch time but would have to turn it off during class time would be a very good thing they would have against us. Like for example if a student is caught using their phone during class the teacher would probably write them up so they would get after school detention but then the vice principal would also get involved and what if she said' s we lost the advantage to use phones during lunch just because one student from the entire school but that mat happen if this is happening to many students.

I know for a fact if this policy is accepted for the school mostly all the students of the school would love that and take advantage but good advantage. And I know they would respect the rule that we can't use them in class because the fact that we will be able to use them on our free time and lunch would just be awesome for us students. Now if this policy is accepted you wouldn't regret it because as class president I would even give a speech and heads up to the students about this.

I also think that we should be able to use them during free periods like gym, certain electives, and lunch. I don't think cell phones are a bad thing to have at school. They do not harm kids, unless someone is texting or calling to say bad things to someone else. If that does happen then they should go to a adult or teacher or someone like that about it.

I want to have my cell phone at school, so incase something happens to my family, or there is a emergency with them, they can reach me. After school I do a lot of stuff too, like going out with my friends, or after school programs. If i don't have my phone with me then my parents would not know where I am or what I am doing, and that can cause a big problem. I like to keep my phone with me at all times because if i put it down for just a minute i would probably lose it.

If we did have our phones at school, I do think that we should have it off or on silent during all our major classes. It could cause a distraction to ourselves, and the students around us if it was on. I am all for having my phone at school, and I do want this rule to change and let us have them.

I think that you should allow cell phones during lunch period because it's not class technically. I also think you should let us have cell phones during lunch period because it's a way the students can communicate. They could also talk to their mom or dad to make sure that they have a ride home safely.

I also think that if you take the cell phones away all together the students will be very mad. I think that the kids would try to sneak their cell phones in the school and that could cause a lot of problems, and the students would be in more trouble and you would have troubles dealing with it. I'm sure you wouldn't want to deal with that anyways.

I think we should be allowed to use out cell phones during lunch or when we have a free period, because if we need to call our parents to come pick us up because we're sick, or we've gotten hurt, we should be able to.

Or if we just want to get in touch with friends, who also have a free period.

If we were able to use our phones when we have free time, there wouldn't be as many kids trying to be sneaky about texting in class.

To begin with, the nurse has a lunch right when we do.

She wont let you into the clinic unless you have a pass from your teacher.

Except, if you fall outside on the patio, or you get sick, there isn't going to be a teacher to write you a pass.

There also isn't going to be a nurse to call your parents for you.

This sounds like a pretty good time to be able to use your cell phone.

Just last year, when I was in 7th grade,

I was running a all day and I was trying to wade it out to see if I could make it through the day.

I tried to go to the clinic, but she wasn't there, and I threw up on the patio.

Had I been able to use my cell phone, I could have had my mom come pick me up.

Also, what if you get hurt out on the patio, such as a fall the cuts your knee wide open.

when there's no nurse, what are you going to do?

I believe this is a reason to think about when considering the cell phone policy.

Teenagers love to communicate.

What better way then with a cell phone?

Now, I know what you're thinking, but I'm not talking about allowing us to have out phones out during classes.

We need to focus on out education.

That's what those core classes are for.

But during lunch, or an elective, if our friends have a free period as well, what would the harm be in texting them?

It's not like we're distracting them from learning math, or science, or another important class.

Just by allowing us to have our phones out for the two or three classes plus lunch we have that aren't core classes, you wouldn't have near as many problems with kids texting in their actual classes.

I believe kids would actually focus more in their class knowing that they don't have to risk getting caught now, when they know there will be a time for them to text later.

When thinking about the cell phone policy for SCHOOL_NAME, I hope you'll take my ideas into consideration.

If kids are sick or hurt, and the nurse isn't there, what are they going do?

Be sick all day?

A quick call or text to mom or dad would help a lot.

I truly believe it would benefit a students daily life at school if they could use there cell phones during there free time. In this letter i will expand on this idea and why I believe that it is true. Hopefully you will consider it.

First of all i believe that with cell phones at lunch or break would prevent students from being tempted to take them out in class. With there phones out during there free time they will students could be more social with other students teaching them a valuable life lesson. Because students will be able to use them during free time, they will feel as though they do not have to use them during class time. Saving both the teacher and the students some trouble.

Also, i believe that it would benefit the noise level. Being able to use phones at lunch or other free periods would take more attention off of talking and more on texting or other applications that a cell phone has.

With all of the noise gone from the lunchroom or break area teachers could get more done with the day then waiting around looking to get people into trouble. Lastly of this idea every day i see teachers complaining that, a students phone went off in class, well if we could use them during free time maybe that wouldn't happen.

Finally, i will say that with cell phones there could also be better working conditions for teachers as well as students. With cell phones, teacher would be able to use that as a work device they could save time, they could be used to call an important person or a speaker to talk to there class, and teachers will be able to do work that would be unavailable to them on a computer .

Those were just some ideas to change your mind about cell phone usage. Please consider the students, and not just them but yourself as well.

I believe policy 2 will be much better. Phones shouldn't be used in school at all except for lunch, because while your in class because they will end up using there phones instead of getting a proper education. They will also distract others from learning when they are not using there phones. They shouldn't really even have it during lunch at all, everything will be a disaster. Most people wont even have it off during the classes they will just have them on as long as it doesn't make any sound in class. Students should have there phone during school because if there is am emergency that couldn't even call the office they should have there phones on vibrate. If they use there phones during school it just wouldn't work out, every one would stop paying attention during classes and when the teacher, principle, or staff is talking to them they would not pay attention. Even for the school assembly's or games they would not pay attention and just be on the phones regularly. The parents would get mad for the students not getting an education, and possibly fail there classes. Parents will get furious and file a complaint. If there phones go on in class teacher, and students will get distracted for the people who want to learn and will not get there education. When people try to study at the library they will pretend to study but use the phone when the test comes will not no what to do. When they are taking a math test they will cheat by using there phone as a calculator. While the teacher is on the board they will start to use there phones and not learn anything. While they are going to a class they will be on the phone, what if there was stares and they were to pay attention to the fall and trip or fall? they would really injured and school would be held responsible. While they are walking if they hit someone you never no if someone will find it like if you hit them on purpose and try to hit you back. In the morning when there waiting for the bell to ring and there on the phones when the bell does ring they would be late to class and just lie to the teacher and do it again.

If we get this policy we should be able to show our principal that we are young adults. If we have this policy i am going to be happy cause this a change to show our principal that we can do it without her telling us because we are older to know what's right from wrong.

I think that Policy 1 is the best choice for our school. This policy states that ""students are allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during free time and at lunch as long as they are turned off in the classroom."" There are several reasons why I think this is the best choice for our school. Below are a few of them.

Firstly, I think you should choose this policy because being a student here, I know what its like to want to communicate with friends. I think that if you let us use our cell phone at lunch to communicate with friends, we will be less likely to be rude and obnoxious in the class room.

Second, as you may know, some cell phones are equipped with internet, music, cameras and other things that could keep a student busy at lunch time. In example, if a student has a cell phone that plays music, that person will sit quietly listening to music instead of other, disruptive things he might be pressured to do by his ""friends"".

Third, if a student has a cell phone that they are allowed to bring to school, it may make them more apt to attend school instead of sitting around all day playing on his or her phone.

I know that there are several negative points in allowing students to bring cell phones to school, such as classroom disruption, thefts and damages to mentioned devices, but in my opinion i think the more positive points that i have listed above outweigh the negative ones. So, in conclusion, I think that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school.

Policy #1 Please!

I can't believe the principal is actually considering letting students use their phones; IN SCHOOL!! It's like a dream come true!

I think the principal should totally choose this policy number one. You want to know why?? Well here i go.

I think you should let us use our cell phones in school because I don't Know what the big deal is! As long as we can use them during our free time , I don't think it would be an issue. I can understand with you not wanting us to use them in the class rooms because that is the learning hour. So I think it would be okay and should be considered to let us use our cell phones at appropriate times of the school day.

I think if the teachers are still worried about cell phone use in class, they should make students take out their phones and put them on their desk top and take out the battery. This could really help out. And sure, I would love the thought of being able to use our cell phones at least once a day. At breaks and lunch would be awsome.

And it could be that if students get their daily talk out of the way, their lively to focus and do better in the class rooms.

So i don't think that you shouldn't be able to use your phone at all, just not

ALL

It would help the students out and the teachers out so that they won't be so worried and so the kids won't have to get in trouble and get sent to the office because of their cell phones go off in class or their caught texting.

I think that students should be able to use there cell phone during lunch and other free times.

First of all, students cant cheat on test or any kind of work cause during school when they are learning, she cant have there cell phone on or if they do and there texting they will get caught. they wont do anything if they use there cell phone during school, just text other friends. I don't think that it would be bad if students use there cell phones. Especially cause there's no work during lunch, not unless the student has detention.

Second, I don't think that students will text in class cause they already got that urgent feeling of texting out. I think that teachers should be more aware if the students are texting in class or using there phone. I don't think that a student will try and cheat with other students during lunch. If you ever allow this, I think that if a student is caught texting or using phone during class, i think that they should get there phone taken away and having there parents come and pick the phone up. And if there caught a second time then they should not get there phone back.

Third, if I were a teacher, then I would pick up all phones before starting class and put them in a box. Then give them back after class. I think that is far and smart. I also think that ipods and other electronics can be used during lunch or any other free time. As long as the phone are turned of during class time then i think that the students should be able to use there cell phone and electronics during school.

So that's my opinion on why students should be able to use there cell phone and other electronics during school.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Students will eventually disobey this rule so i think the punishment for disobeying should be that the students have to give up their phone for one month and then can get it back. altho the problem with taking their phone away would be that if the parents of the student wanted to reach them they wouldn't be able to.

I think that at the beginning of the day students should put their phones into a big bucket and then after school get them so they can have them after school. if a student is texting during class then they most likely would not be listening and would not learn things. if they are texting they might not learn something and forget how to do it when they have homework..

I sincerely hope you will not have to take such severe actions as to ban cell phones from school no matter what because that truly would not be a good idea. I think you should allow students to bring their phones and permit them to use their phones during free periods and lunch periods as long as they aren't disturbing people in class, which won't happen because you will make students turn their phones off during class and/or take them from them during class and give the phones back after class. This would cause the students to pay attention no matter what, even though the students already do pay attention.

Taking away all phone privileges would be wrong a dangerous very, very dangerous. What would happen if an armed person came into the school and the school's telephone lines were cut? There would be no way to contact the police or anybody to help with the situation. I say this because if students aren't allowed to have phones teacher's shouldn't be able to have phones at school either. That would be unequal rights, a form of segregation, so to speak. Students are not suppose to use phones during school at all and students very rarely break that rule. However, all the time students see their teachers using their phones. That is a bad example because that sends the message to the students that its okay to break the rule and use your phone during school. If you ban phones from students you have to band phones from teachers as well. That brings me back to the beginning of this paragraph. With no phones allowed to students or teachers there would be no way to contact help. That is a very serious problem and that should be more of a concern than whether students can have phones in school or not if they don't use them during class.

Suppose a teacher sees a student with a phone out in class, will happen? The teacher should take the phone away and not give it back until the end of class. No big deal. However you are saying that the teachers don't catch the students using their cell phones during class, well then they should make sure at the beginning of class that there phones are off and that they keep them on their desk so the teacher can see if they are using them or not. Or the teacher could just take everyone's phone at the beginning of class and not have to worry about it. That is a plus because students don't need phones during class anyway. I'm saying that the students don't need phones in class not all together no phones. I am saying this because some students have games on their phones that they can play during open periods or at lunch. That isn't affecting anything or anyone because they have an open period so there is no teacher to annoy by using their phone and they have a ton of time on their hands so they want to make there time fun. The video may have persuaded you the wrong way. Students dont really use there phone that much. Besides most of those examples were during free periods or free time that the student has. That would lead you to believe that the students should be able to use their phones during free time and that cell phones rarely affect the class and or class work.

In the video only one time does it show that a students phone is being used during class. The others are in the hallway, outside, or in a place where their phones won't disturb anyone around them. That is a big positive. Students don't try to annoy teachers they, it just happens that sometimes a random student gets bored and uses their phone but that only happens like once or twice.

i know that you are considering two polices at a attempt to stop the improper use of cell phones at school, but to even consider to not let people bring their phones to school is too extreme so please choose policy one.

What happens if we have a emergency?

What can we use to call the people we need to reach, we don't have our phones!

I personally walk home and my phone is my lifeline.

I may get a call from my mom saying that i have a dentist appointment, but i would have phone so i will cost my mom money.

I could get hurt while I'm walking no one is usually around me.

What happens if we need something for school.

We cant remember everything, we are human.

Our school get boat loads of important forms that have consequences attached if they are late.

If we forget to bring them in we can call our parent via cell phone and get them in.

Plus, it cost money to use the school phone, although it's not much money we still don't carry that around.

phones enable us to do so much we could never do with out them.

Although, our phones are get more entertaining and more advanced, they still help everyday.

The first policy states that we can use our phones during passing breaks and lunch so that is when we can use it for entertainment.

Cell phones are a necessity in our time.

they can help you get out of any situation.

They can get us through emergencies and homework.

In my opinion I say that Policy 1 is a whole better than Policy 2. Why? Well because if were allowed to use our cell phones during any free time or lunch it would make maybe stop us from using our phones in class because you will already be giving us a little bit of fun, and also because we are teenagers what fun can we have in school if we cant use our phones. Most of the time we don't even use them to text with, we also use them to play games or even listen to music or take pictures. What I'm trying to say is that if we are able to use our phones during free time and lunch and have them turned of during school it would be better instead of having to take away cell phones away from a student everything time they get caught for using a cell phone.

All the student will be glad to have Policy 1 just for the fact that we will have time to use our phones during school and I'm sure students will like school a little more. Hopefully the students will not take advantage of the policy. Just think about we will have fun during lunch and pay attention in class, because when we are using our phones in class we don't pay attention because we are to busy texting or making sure we don't get caught using our phones. And if you feel that you are giving us to much freedom then we cant have our phones on high volume or just give a certain amount of time to use our phone during school, we will be glad to be using our phones. So hopefully you think of the students and make the cell phone policy a whole lot better.

E4F64D34C2F1,"I believe that the use of the cell phone policy during lunch is a good idea. The kids need to use the cell phones for stuff like emergencies. The kids have already been caught before with cell phones. Why not give them a little freedom. We should be able to use cell phones as long as we don't use them in class. Teachers have caught students using them and it's never going to stop. You might as well do with the policy, because it's only going to be during lunch. If an emergency happened and a parent was trying to get to theirkid the phone would be off.

I have a better offer for you. We could just text. A phone ring could disturb people but if the phone was just on vibrate that would work better. Texting is a better way instead of hearing someone's ring tone. Cell phone privileges should be aloud in school's. They are a resourceful way to get information. Besides, it's just when we eat. The teachers shouldn't really care how we use a phone at lunch. Cell phones are used in everyday life and why not school.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
AF31964E08DE,"Principal this letter is for an school policy for using cell phones during school hours. I think that the first policy needs to be accepted that one that says ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use it at lunch and in free times. However they must be turn of during class periods or studing "". Because what happens if the parents of the student cannot come to school and the student grandma house its close to the school the parents can called them and tell him that go walking to his grandma house. The other reason is that if it is an emergency in the school you can call 911 or your parents to come to the school.

Plus what happens when you are trap in something dangerous and nobody can hear you and you just have your phone you can call somebody that can help you get out of their. That's

Why we want the phones that can be use during free time for emergency and caution so I telling you that make phones free to use during lunch time and free time only

I hope that you accept my offer.

44D6CAC4CC60,"To the principal:

(I'm assuming that, in policy 2, students will not be able to keep cell phones at school, even if they're off and in the lockers)

I believe that the idea of banning cell phones in school at all is absurd. What if the students need to call their parents or a friend for a ride home or to an event after school? They would be forced to use a phone provided by the office, which would undoubtedly have a long line leading to it. Based on the amount of people I see that use their cell phones to contact home, it may take a good fifteen to thirty minutes for all students to use the one or two phones that may be provided. Personally, I don't think I'd make it without my cell phone, with all of the events going on that I forget to tell my dad about, or that I wasn't even aware of (such as when I had to go to UIL or tennis practice, but I was unaware of it)

Allowing students to use their phones during free time could allow them to contact home as well, to tell parents at an even more convenient time that, yes, they will need to be picked up, or no, that they will not need to be picked up, before the parent has left the house (or not left the house) to do one of these two, or the parents would be notified in time to bring something up to the school that the students have forgotten. On the other hand, students could use this policy against the teachers and claim that they conveniently 'forgot' to turn off their cell phones, and were 'just checking if it was important'. However, I don't think that this would be a huge problem. After a week or two, you could stop giving students the benefit of the doubt, and start enforcing the punishments.

Without cell phones in school altogether, they would be useless. The main reason adults buy their children cell phones is so they can be contacted after school, in the case of an immediate change in plans. This will no longer be a possibility, and cell phones would not serve their main purpose. Parents may avoid purchasing cell phones for their children until they are much, much older.

In conclusion, I think policy 1 is better, but it isn't perfect. It has minor flaws (misuse of phones, etc.), but not as many as policy 2 has (inability to contact home easily, etc.). Policy 2 would make many students use the school's phones, which would have long lines anyhow, and it may take a long time to tell your parents something that is immediately important. Too much (freedom, in this case) is better than too little, and that's a philosophy that I apply almost everywhere.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8
059DFFE3A3A9,"Both policy's of whether cell phones should be aloud in school were brought up by the principal. In my opinion, i think that having cell phones switched off during school would be a great idea. It would create less of a distraction during learning time, which would help them do better in their classes. If the students feel they need to contact someone immediately, the school office or each classroom is most likely to contain a telephone, or even a mobile phone. Having a cell phone at school can also create problems of cheating and sharing answers on tests or homework.

In our world with so many new apps, games, and picture messaging, students are more likely to be getting interested in their phone than their school work. During free periods learning should still be happening. Instead of checking their myspace, facebook, etc., they could be trying to improve their grades and doing homework.

Kids may feel sick or need help from parents time to time. The school has phones in which they can contact the people they need. Having their phone with them is not going to better their chances of getting a hold of someone. It may decrease time till their help has arrived but it wont better their chances by getting a hold of someone any more then just a regular school phone.

As a kid, i have experience difficulty on tests several times. Has it been easy to just glance over and see the answer on somebody else's paper, yes it has. Does it make it right? No. Some student may choose to keep their phone on silent on past lunch or free periods and could possible ask a friend in that class for an answer they are struggling on. I have seen student do it, and although it may be wrong, having cell phones on you can make students tempted to do this.

Having cell phones in school is opening a whole new set of problems for teachers and student and should just be kept off during the day and used at home or while that student is out doing what his or her does. School is for learning, not for checking your e-mail or notifications on a social networking site.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6
594BA746F1E3,"Dear Principal,

I believe that the cell phone policy at school needs to change. I think that the policy that would best fit our school is Policy 1. Policy 1 allows us students to feel like we have more freedom. Choosing policy 1 would also help in reducing the number of students sneaking their cell phones out and secretly texting their friends or going on the internet to check their Facebook status. I believe that cell phone use is a part of the teenagers life. Our life depends on our cell phones. We eat, sleep, and are with our phones 24/7. Banning the use of cell phones at school will just cause problems such as more disruptions in class and more people rebelling against the no cell phone policy sending more and more people to the office. Whenever a student is caught with a cell phone, what happens? They are sent to the principals office! That not only causes a disruption in the classroom, but it takes away time the students should be using to learn the new material, not laughing and snickering at the person caught red handed with their phone. Also the student sent out will miss what was taught in that class, and high school is not a time in which one should be missing out on. High school is preparing us for the real world and if we are constantly being sent out because we were caught with a cell phone, less and less people will understand the material taught to them. That could cause failing grades, and those failing grades could keep someone from graduating.

So you see that by choosing policy one, you not only give us students the freedom with our cell phones that we want, you also get less classroom disruptions and more people graduating. Really, if you take a good hard look at it, Policy 1 is the best way to go! With policy one the students are happy, and you will be happy because you will see each and every one of you students graduate and take on the real world with the confidence that they need to succeed. Is that not your goal for all students? With policy 1 that goal will be accomplished in no time. So choose policy 1 when you reconsider our cell phone policy. You will see that the effects are going to be much better that policy 2.

Your student.      ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I believe that Policy #1 would be a better policy for students. I know cell phones can be a bad thing if student use them during classes, but letting them use them during their lunch and free periods sounds great. I think using them during those periods don't bother teachers because they can't really do anything to get them selves in trouble.

Their are pros and cons to this policy as there are for basically any policy. The cons are people's phones can get lost or stolen. Some pros are student can call one another if they need help on an assignment, call their parents if there is an emergency and students just love their phone. Kids spend a lot of their time with or on their phones.

Going with Policy #1 would also make a lot of other students happy, and maybe even some teachers. It's like a compromise between the students, who want to use their phones and the teacher, who don't. It might even lessen they amount of students who use their phones during classes because they know they can just wait till lunch or their free period to text of call their friend back. It can also be a problem if a student were to try and contact their friend during class, but all in all it really sounds like a good plan for a school fullof teenagers who can't live without their phones.

Say there was a man who came into your school and was going to do something bad, you would have your phone and be able to call for help, plus in College the students are aloud to use their cell phone, just not during class. This policy could be like getting the students accustom to how things are in College, and sort of teach them the responsibility of turning off their phone when they are somewhere with other people listening to a speaker or presentation.

It would be nice for students to have some freedom like this, and I think the students would really appreciate something like this. I know I would just love to be able to call my mom and talk about my day so far. or if I left something important at home and ask her if she could come bring it to me, or even ask her for a ride home. It'd be just a great thing to be able to do, if you would be as kind enough to let us be able to use our phones during lunch and off periods, we'd love it.

You should take Policy 1 because we work hard in school and we would love a little free time and put them away when we are in class or in the hall ways. Policy 1 is better for us because we have some thing to do on our lunch. Policy 2 is not good for us because if we are in class we cant focus because all we are thinking about is our phone and how we cant wait to use it. If we have policy 1 we could focus better and class and do our work better then when we have our break we wont be thinking about using our phone. But I kind of disagree because if we have our break and we are done with using our phone some people disobey the teacher and use their phones in class or when they are suppose to put their phones in their locker use them during any time the teacher is not looking so I kind of agree with Policy 2. I think you should pick Policy 2 because I could not stand not using my phone for more than 6 hours.

I believe having phones in a class room would not be constructive but at lunch and their free time they don't have to be doing anything constructive hence why its called ""free time"". Their also must be consequences set up just in case a student is using his/her phone in class.

I believe that Policy 1 is the best choice. Policy 1 is the best choice because it could be used for emergencies or to keep in touch with their fellow classmates. Many of the students have a cell phone and always want to use it for texting, calling, playing app's, and more. If we can't use our cell phones what's the point of having one? All the students will agree on Policy 1.

I agree with your thoughts about not having cell phones in class and have them shut off. If students have their cell phone out and use them during class they could be talking about the teacher, and making fun of her while she is teaching. Also, the teacher may not know they're talking about her and laugh along which will make her look stupid. All teachers should be treated with respect and cell phones may just make the teachers respect go down hill. Due to the text messages the could be sending.

Also, in the class the teacher could give out a pop quiz or a regular test. Most teachers would forget the rule of having cell phones in class. That would not be good because students could send the answers to their friends and class mates and the teacher would never know. This would not teach the students to pay attention in class all they have to do is text. Cell phones have so many high tech devices and can be used the wrong way. If the teacher is doing a review during the test a student could record it and play it over during the test which is giving them all the answers.

Although students can't have their phones during class, they can have them during lunch and free periods. This is good because students could keep in touch with their parents. If a student was talking to their friend about coming over to their house at lunch and they wanted to inform their parents they could call them or text them during lunch. Also, a student can keep in touch with one of their friends that's sick and wants to know how they're doing at home. Considering, if they want them to come after school to make them feel better.

Overall, Policy 1 is the best choice. It lets the students have time to chat with their friends and inform their parents about work in school or questions. Policy 2 doesn't allow students to contact anyone such as they're friends or parents. This is not good in case there is an emergency. However, Policy 1 can. That's is why Policy 1 is the best choice.

You should consider a vote from all staff and students to help you decide on weather or not cellular devices should be allowed period. Some friends and I have talked about your decisions, and have decided that policy number one would be perfectly fine with out questioning. That being said here is something to convince you that the first policy is the best choice.

If students were allowed to use cellular devices during their lunch and free hours only, they could use the cellular device to help with school work, and contact teachers and friends. To help understand I have come up with an example to help you see why this policy make sense. You have a student who has trouble doing homework at home because of the environment at his/ her home. so they decide to complete their homework during their lunch/ free hours. While doing a math problem they get stuck and can't figure out the answer to the equation and a calculator is no where near... If they were allowed to use there phone they could possibly use the calculator that has been pre- programmed into it. It's happened to students before and it will definitely happen again.

That wasn't the best example but it sounded very convincing to myself, so if you could please just think this over and definitely consider a vote from the school. It would be worth the time.

C03D9C272DBF,"Have you ever have an emergency in school? I'd had that's why policy number 2 is really important.

Sometimes student have emergency's, or probably we just want to call someone and make sure they are ok.

Everyone in the world use phones, but i think that the principle should let the students used the phone, during free time in school.

Student should not be allowed to use the phone during classes.

Sometimes I'd have emergency's for example: one day i didn't feel good my head was hurting during free time and i couldn't use my phone because the school didn't let us use it, and if they saw the phone i was going to be in a big trouble.

So i stay all the day in the school and when i got home i was really sick and had to go to the doctor, and it cost much more then just calling my parents to come and pick me up.

Another reason that cell phones are really important is when we have family members or little brothers stay at home by themselves.

We want to check on them and see if they are ok if nothing had happen in the house.

Having little brothers or sisters on the house by themselves is not safe, that's why you need a cell phone to communicate with them.

Without a cell phone you don't know if your mom or dad or anyone needs, how bout if it's really important, and you would like to help but without a cell phone you wont even know what's happening.

And if you do have a cell phone during your free time we could check the missing calls or if we need to call someone for an emergency, we could just call without getting in trouble, and without the teachers coming and start chasing you because we have a cell phone.

This is also a waste of time for the teachers too.

Having a cell phone in our hands we can live a little bit safer, a cell phone is not just play time, but it can safe our live, or maybe help someone by our cell phone.

That's why cell phone our really important to carry them around with us.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
3215F95D4312,"Dear Principal,

I have heard of the two policies you have been considering, regarding cell phones in school. I just wanted to share with you my perspective about this situation. I believe that you should select policy number one. You want the children to look forward to coming to school, instead of feeling like they are forced to go someplace they dislike. Giving the students the right to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times will give them the personality that you long to see. Also, if the students want to come to school more often that will have a huge affect on Count Day. If cell phones are used during these free times, i don't really think there will be a disturbance to other students/staff members.

Another, If students from other schools discover the new policy at our school district, they will want to transfer to the district to have these rights. Cell phones have been banned from schools for as long as i can remember; they should experiment with something new, since many generations are passing up the opportunity to still be in school, and just say, ""I never wanted to go to school, but I finished.""

The only thing is that I don't know what the parents of the children would say. Some might agree with the idea and won't mind their kids using cell phones in school, but some might disagree and want their kids to not be distracted during school, and to just learn the curriculum that the school has to offer. Many people are going to have different opinions, so the best thing to do is to take a poll for this matter. A poll where students and parents vote for what they believe should happen with this whole cell phone policy.

Therefore, my opinion is to choose policy one, where kids can use cell phones during free time. Let the students have some fun. But, it's your decision, you're the principal of this school, not me. Thank you for your time. Have a nice day!

Dear Principal,

I have been notified that you are giving us two policies about cell phones.

I think that the policy that should be chosen should be ""DO NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO HAVE PHONES AT SCHOOL AT ALL."" I know that three main reasons there should be cell phones at school is because of time, learning, and responsibility. Cell phones will be a major distraction on these things to students.

To start off with, time is a big thing in school. Be in school on time, don't be late and if there are any important days don't miss out. Cell phones will take time away from a students learning and education. It will also affect on the students grades. I'm sure a parent wouldn't want that to happen.

Secondly, the learning of students. These electronics we speak of is a big distraction to a students learning. Cell phones will take away what the students are trying to learn in school. Students aren't really suppose to be at school texting. They are suppose to be at school learning for their future.

Last but not least, I think phones should not be allowed in school because it will bring great responsibility in a students life. If the phone ever gets stolen, damaged, or anything happens to it they are going to have to be responsible with their own actions. They wont really have the right to blame anyone else because they made the wrong choices of bringing it to school.

I really hope that these reasons will prevent your opinion from cell phones. Once in a wile they could use it at school even though they are not allowed but the students have to bring responsibility within themselves. Other people may disagree with me but i think they should understand the consequences first.

I think you should approve policy number one, not because I'm a student who wants to have my phone out, but because sometimes we need it and this is why.

First ,how about if we had an accident, how could we contact someone, and wasn't able to go to the office. Like if you fell down and there was no one near you, you could take out your phone and contact some one.

Next ,its free time or lunch we could call a parent to bring us money or food. Sometimes students don't eat because they need to call there parents to bring them something but the office is closed you could just use your phone, and students wont starve anymore.

Last but not least , we wont use it a lot only for the necessary things . Its also free time, and we might get bored ,so we could just use your phone. It also wont disturb anyone and its easy.

kids could bring their cell phones too school but to have them off before entering there classes. so they wont get there cell phone taking away or get in trouble or in danger kids need to stop bringing there cell phones to school and listen to what the teachers in school have to say. like if there is a test and the kids are texting how are they going to know about it when their not really listening to what she is saying. kids are not even suppose to have a cell phone its a policy if you have it or not its up too the parents.

and plus kids bring their cell phones to school and they end up get stole or broke and the parents end up getting really mad at them. kids could text talk on the phone mostly after school not in school because we all come to learn not to really fool around. if kids keep on fooling around their is no education for them. in free times kids could use their phone it depends if the teachers let them. its not policy that you really have too use your phone like who are you going to chat with when your friends are right next too you. other times in school kids still use their phones and no one actually tells them anything .

And why would principals even let kids bring their cell phones to school just putting their life in danger.

I think it would be nice to be able to bring our phones to school and only use them at lunch or any other free time we have. We should be able to have the phones on in school just not aloud to have them on where you could hear it. But, having the phones in school and being able to use them whenever we have a free period is a good idea. I think this policy is better because what if someone or a family member has to tell you something very important.

I mean sometimes parents don't like to call because they know they student is in school so they'd rather text them. Instead of calling them because maybe they don't want they news broadcasted on the intercom. I don't think having the students not bring their phones to school is a good solution. Either way you put it they are going to bring their phone , or whatever else technology they have.

So I think letting the students be able to bring their phones is a good solution , because you are letting them use it at a certain time of the day maybe more because students may have a free period twice a day. Well all I'm saying is that you should take a good look into letting students bring there phone to school at least they wouldn't have they phone out only the time there aloud to use it. Like when you see teachers on there phone it's like oh ok i could use my phone to. But when they see the student use there phone it's a problem. i don't find that to be fair.

The other policy I personally believe is not a good solution , because either you put it students are going to bring there phone. You will see there phone out more than ever. And if you ask for it you wouldn't get it. They going to ignore you and act like they can't hear you with all the music they are listening to. So yeah i think it would be nice for you to look forward into having that policy you never know you might see improvement in things.

Dear Principal :

I agree with policy 1 & 2. Some student have their phone for emergencies, but most don't. Most student have their phone in class texting, talking, listening to music, taking pictures, & more.

I agree with policy 1, cause students should be allowed to communicate with others but not during class, during the lunch and other breaks are fine cause its not stopping them from learning in the lunch room, gym, or outside. Most students play basketball, football, run track, softball, baseball, or soccer they have games and they should be allowed to bring their devices to get in touch with someone to take them home or call a teammate to tell them it about to start or whatever, stuff like that should be a reason for them to bring there phones. But most students don't play sports. And they text and other things in class.

I also agree with policy 2, cause the students aren't paying the teacher any attention and she or he just teaching for no reason. That will help the test scores to if the cell phone were not allowed at school the test scores would go up. I think the students would sit there and listen to the teacher cause they would have nothing else to do. When the test scores go up maybe they'll be able to bring they're phone and other electronics to school, cause they they've earned to bring them to school and the principal trust them.

So i agree with both policy 1 & 2. Because their are several reasons that i could conclude about them.

F7B157AE1751,"dear principle, i think you should go with policy 1 is you would reconcider the cell phone policy in our school. i think you should use this one because 8 periods a day for for 6 hours a day all we do is learn and have a little break is lunch but in between periods there are lets say 5 minutes to travel to class to class and hense that your not learning so that make it our free time and our free time is,our free time witch should be watever we want to do that is not dangeruos or breaking school rules. so letting us use our phone would be a great idea to keep the bad kids from doing somthing stupid or so friends can cumunicate with each other if they dont see each other through out the whole day so i think policy number 1 is a good choice for the school and they students in the school and instead of turning your phone off during class i think isnt realy a good idea because we have kids that with just think that the teacher wont notice or look im cool because my phone is on. soo to get rid of that problem i would have each teacher have a bag or a box and when each students comes in the door they would have to put there phone in the box and if they got cought on them during class i would make the teacher take it away and they wouldnt see it for the rest of the day. and another idea for the cell phone policy is that all cell phone should be on vibrate or the sound should be off so you dont have all ringtones or beeping sounds goring throught the hall way when other students are trying to cumunicate by talking. so like i said you should go with policy 1 but change it up just a little bit just like i said to do with the sound off and with the teachers putting all the cell phone in a box before class and get them after class and if got caught take it away and the student wouldnt see it untill the end of the day.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
C546087ABE6D,I think we should be able to us our phones at any free time that we may have and that they should be off just in the class room. But if that becomes a problem then you can take away our phone privileges. We should be able to use our cell phones in case of an emergency or if we need anything from our homes. Some kids use their phones when the teacher isn't looking or when they go to the restroom or anything else when they leave the classroom or in the classroom. I only use my cell phone when its the end of the day and the bell has wrong for us to get out if school and go home or do anything that we have to do when we are out of school st that time. Some kids use it in the library when they are by their self's or in the hall on the way to class. But i think we should be able to use our phones at any free time and at our lunch period to text or call or friends or parents. I would love to use my phone at any free time because i have my friends texting me while we are in school and my parents text me at times to tell me that i am an car rider or to stay after school and to ride the bus so that's why i think we should be able to use our phones at any free time. Sometimes girls have their problems and they might need some personal things that them or their friends may not have and they might need their mother to bring them something or their guardian to do it for them. We have problems that we should be able to use our phones and get that type of help from our friends and other people that we may know that can help us with our problems that we are having because they might know the answer to our problems and other things like that.

Also if the principal let us have our own time to use our cell phone then student wouldn't have to argue about it because if we student can't have our own cell phone out then the teacher or staff shouldn't either because it wouldn't be unfair to some student who have cell phones cause they can't check their cell phones. If we have lunch time to use our cell phone then student would really be glad and thankful to the principal for letting us do this kind of stuff. Cell phones are a good help for us because cell phone can remind us if we have to do any home work or check online for anything that we cant find, and the computer/laptop would take a while to load up and start the program but our cell phones would be faster for us to look for some of the home work or school work that we couldn't find. If we turn off our phone during class and only use them for a certain amount of class period then it would be good for us student and what happens if our parents have an emergency for us and we didn't check our phone, sometimes it might be a big emergency for them to text or call us because what if someone in our family broke a bone or pass away, cell phone may be a big help if we need them. Also cell phone can be a help to check our phone or call our parents to remind us things we need and maybe our parents can remind us to bring home some books or some home work for our younger brother/sister to do when they are absent . Cell phone is a really big help but some teacher or staff thinks its just a distraction for other people because they might think different, and they might also though that the person is just using it to text or play with it for a while when the teacher is giving important information.

For me, Policy 1 is better, base from my own opinion. Because Policy 1 would be better from Policy 2. For students to avoid breaking the rules of their own school, Policy 1 would be the better choice. Because they can use their phones during their break, lunch periods and whenever they have a free time. In some cases, most students and parents prefer to have the Policy 1 so that whenever they have an emergency or an important thing to do so, they can easily contact each other, except for contacting each other inside their classes.

As long as their phones are in silence or they won't be using it during their class time, Policy 1 is a good choice. And for me, Policy 1 is the best choice among all of the choices that the principle would have. For students, having Policy 1 could be nice. I think they would really appreciate it if they would be having that policy. Because if in some reason, Policy 2 would be the one that the Principle will be choosing, there's a possibility that a lot of students will make a way to break the rule just to bring their gadgets, even though they might get into trouble. But, students must know their limitations whenever they use their phones or gadgets inside the campus.

Students shouldn't be using it whenever the teacher is discussing or whenever they're inside their classrooms. Because, instead of learning a lot of things from the school, they would just waste their time using those gadgets. I hope that you understand me why I chose Policy 1 rather than the other Policy which is the second choice. Because I know how it feels like when you don't have your phone by your side and didn't noticed that something emergency from your family is happening. I wish you would be considering or approving my opinion. I choosing the right opinion so that won't have any alibis for breaking the rule of your school.

Cell phones have always been a big conflict when it comes to school policies.

Many schools have a no phone policy. Other schools only allow cell phones during free times, such as lunch or between classes. I believe that students should be allowed to use cell phones at school during free periods. They provide valid communication, allow students to have more freedom, and shows that the principle has respect for her students.

Cell phones at school provide a way of communicating with other students. Say that OTHER_NAME was trying to find his best friend RELATIVE_NAME at school. Well, all OTHER_NAME would have to do is send RELATIVE_NAME a text asking him where he was. Then, RELATIVE_NAME could simply reply that he was out by the fountain at the front of the school, so OTHER_NAME could meet him there. Another scenario where your cell phone could be used at school, is if one of your friends is at home, sick, that way you could text them their assignments after each period. These are just a few ways that cell phones can be used for communication at school.

Freedom is a huge concern with middle and high school students. Allowing them to have their phone at free times gives them the perfect amount of freedom. It's just enough to please them, but not too much, so that it'll get them in trouble. Who knows? After a while the students could get tired of using their phones at school. At lest try to provide the students with freedom, and if that doesn't work the policy can be changed.

Almost everyone in the whole world wants respect. Especially teenagers struggling with a identity. Allowing the students to have their cell phones shows them that you have a certain respect for them. They'll be grateful that you allow them to have their phones. They will even start respecting you more if you have a respect for them. So, show your students respect and allow them to use their cell phones. I can guarantee that they'll return that respect.

On the behalf of my fellow classmates and I, we would like to consider the fact of not being able to use cell phones at school. Even though, spending time with friends is one of the most important things in a student's life, it should not allow a disruption during a student education.

In this case cell phones should not be allowed to be used during school hours.

To start out with, I know that students love to have cell phones but it should come to the case where they should not stop from learning. There is only one reason that I think that students come to school is because they want to learn and to become more educated for future plans. The different ways a cell phone can disrupt a students' learning is by texting constantly and talking out loudly with a friend and causing the teacher to take superb action.

In addition, the last thing that a student wants to have if their cell phone taking away and their parent being informed about it. So the best thing to do is to not have them out to begin with. Even though, it would be really nice to use your cell phone during free time, it could also lead to complaints and father discipline. Such as the music being to loud or when the bell rings a student may not hear it and forget to go to class.

Finally, if our school lets students bring in their cell phones, there will be a never ending rush through the halls looking and blaming other people for taking their cell phones. And chasing other students all around the school and yelling to give it back and also causing disruption for other class learning or taking a test. Plus, there would be more talking about other things than just school work. And if a student does not focus on their school work, their grades could fall greatly causing their cell phones to get taken away by their parents.

In conclusion, my fellow classmates and I know that cell phones should not be allowed in any school because of the reasons that could affect the students way of learning.

I hope that when our principal reads this letter that she will considering that cell phones being used at our school is not a very well thought out idea to have.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Also, if we could use our phones in our free time we would be distracted from fights with means no crowd to hover over the fight. I do believe we should be able to use cell phones but only at break or any free time.

2F7A35D57F7E,"Dear Mrs. Principal,

I believe that we should use the first policy that states that the students can bring phones to school, but should be turned off unless they are currently in lunch or any other free period.

I think this because students need to socialize in between class periods or in their free time, and cell phones really help with that.

Also, many students have parents that are away a lot of the time, and so they rely on their cell phone to talk to them, or when they get home and can't find the key, they can simply call their parents instead of breaking into their own home.

I know that students should have their cell phones in school because they need to socialize.

I know this because talking to other people or peers can really remove a lot of the stress that students feel during their school time, because school does actually put a lot of stress on students.

As a student, I have encountered the school stress firsthand, and if you ask anybody, they will tell you the same thing that I am telling you: When you talk to someone, you feel better about your current predicament.

Another factor why you should let students have their phones during school is that students may need to call someone that isn't in their school, such as a parent or a sibling.

I know this because many students aren't what you would consider to be ""angels,"" and so some students get after school detention, and so they must contact their parents or guardians beforehand so that the parent or guardian can take time out of their schedule to get you once your detention is done, before they make plans and then ruin them by getting you.

Then your parents will be disappointed in you even more than they would if you had just gotten a detention without ruining their plans, which just adds onto the school stress that all students endure, just requiring more cell phone usage.

A last reason why you, as our principal, should choose the first policy is because, with the economy as it is, many students have parents that work past the time when their children get home from their school.

If the child forgets where the lock is or something like that, they can simply call their parents for directions to where it is, but if they don't they must endure a few hours outside of their home, hoping that their parent will be home from work soon, just to have their perfect, peaceful day ruined by you, causing your stress levels to go up once more.

I have experienced a scenario similar to this firsthand, and I know the type of stress that you endure because of not having a cell phone in your pocket to call your mom or dad.

What happened was I came hoe from school in the middle of a small snowstorm, and I found that the locks on my doors had all frozen shut.

Frustrated, I kept tugging at the lock until the key I was trying to place in the keyhole irregularly bent in a different way than it should have, costing my family money.

Instead of going to a nearby friends house as I should have, I walked three miles with my backpack to where my sister worked.

She then had to disappoint her boss by taking me home and getting me inside my warm, comfy house.

On the car ride home, however, I was getting yelled at by my sister, only adding to my bursting stress levels already.

Clearly, Mrs. Principal, it is a better choice to have cell phones allowed in school for the following reasons: Students need to socialize to relieve stress, students need to call family members for help, and to simply enjoy the use of the cell phone so that when you start up with your class work again, you are ready for a new subject and ready to learn.

Also, it can't hurt, because they don't use them during class time.

Mrs. Principal, you should choose policy one.

CDEDC1098F6F,"I feel as though, students should be able to have cell phones at school. Of course, we should turn our phones off in class, but as far as our free time, we should be allowed to have them. When we get our cell phones taken away at school and then we have to pay to get it back, that's so kinky to me. Its Like, Where do i money go?

Students would probably do better knowing that they can have their cell phones out, instead of sneaking them out. When we see our teachers texting or accepting calls in class, that's makes us want to do the same. We understand their adults, but the teacher can interrupt our education, just as well as we would if we had our phones. So, why cant we have our phones out again?

This is my last year in Middle School and from what i hear about at the High School, were allowed to take calls outside of class and use our phones. I just don't see the difference from Middle School and High School. This may sound crazy, but i seriously think students would do so much better in school, if we could have the privilege to have our cell phones out.

The way there making cell phones now an days, we can actually do homework on our phones. I've actually typed a Rela report on my Blackberry, emailed it to myself, printed it, and turned the paper in.

So, phones aren't all about social networking, we can actually do school related activities on there as well.

Well, I hope whoever's reading this can take this in consideration and understand where I'm coming from. I know administrators might think its a bad idea, but just try it and see how it goes. If students cant focus in school and their more interested in their cell phone, then take away the privilege away from them.

I think that we should be able to have our cell phones during school being able to use them during lunch periods and free times as long as it is turned off during class. I think that because if a students parent is sick or in the hospital they should be able to use the cell phone to call. I also think that we should be able to use cell phones because if teachers get a phone call they can answer it i think that we should be able to. I think that you should only be able to answer you cell phone if it is like an emergency or if it is a call from your parents but if it is like a phone call from a family remember but i think that if we are allowed to use them then if something was to happen we could contact somebody. And if we are sick instead of going to the nurse you can just call your mom. And then again if you say no i understand because you will be thinking like what if i let then and then because i said that they will think that it is ok for them to use their phone whenever they want to and that they will just pull out there phone and just text i think that we should for if there is an emergency with a family member.

Your first policy sounds a lot more plausible and lenient to me than the second policy. School's shouldn't take phones away from the students. It'll only cause us to be more angry and use them further. If you suggest a less strict rule such as ""Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times."" I believe it will encourage the kids to only use cell phones during those times, or at least use them less frequently during class hours.

One reason I believe this is I, myself text in the lunchroom. Only because I need something from my mother or to ask a friend something during class free time. If my school let students have their phones out in free times[Or during lunch] they'd probably become less rowdy and are less likely to text during class, for most classes have free time towards the end of class or at the beginning.

Another reason why the first policy would by more appealing is that, if you allow kids to have their phones during free time it might make them feel more at home or relaxed with the environment, so they could open their minds to learning the lessons in the classroom and text when their outside of the classroom.[Or when the lesson is done]

I believe that kids only text in class because they feel like its a normal and rebellious thing to do. They feel bored in class so they text, but if you allow texting to be allowed in classroom free times they won't feel the need to text while the teachers trying to teach, they'll just think ""Oh, I'll just text him/her during free time""

Therefore, that is why I believe in your first policy [students should be able to have their phones out during free time and lunch time only] and I hope you are convinced.

I think that we are old enough to take care of our valuable stuff at school. It's also a good thing because the phones will be turned off in class and not distracting other students that are trying to pay attention.

The teachers don't have to worry about taking students phones away if it goes off. The students don't have to worry about getting in trouble at home because the teacher took their phone away during class.

Another reason is, if we need to get a hold of our parents we have the phone all ready and won't have to use the office phones. Or if our parents need to get a hold of us, they could just call. We should also be able to have them so if theirs a game and its finished we would be able to call our parents. If we get bored at lunch time we could just hear our music from our phone or call another spouse. You could make plans for after school to study or to go eat out or to hang out. If you have friends that need to borrow a phone you could be a good friend and let them call their parents at lunch time. Say you are at the library and get tired of reading you book well you could call someone and talk for a while.

C9F2A45330E1,"Dear principal, I think policy 1 because students have a lot of free time at home to get on their phones. I understand that teachers want students to keep their phones away in class because they are trying to teach us new things. Another reason is that if the student has a test he/she must put them away so they won't get distracted. That's why teachers want them to get on them if they are not in class or anytime when they get out of school. Many teachers say that phones can make the student feel like he/she don't care about their work but they do. I think phones are allowed because there might be an emergency that happened at school and they can't contact their parents.

If you would allow the students to bring cell phones in only for emergencies, there might not be as much disruption in class from the phone ringing. Some parents tell their children to bring them to school because you don't relay know what's going to happen.

I choose policy 1, because there is know reason to make us have to put our phone away when we aren't doing anything like lunch break, before school, while we are changing classes.

The best time for the cell phones are during lunch because most of the people don't eat the lunch food or they are shy and only talk to certain people.... Everyone has a cell phone, and all the teachers know when we are in the hall way we are going to pull them out. Most kids pull them out when the teachers are not look or don't think they are looking...

Some teachers don't like cell phones so bad that if the see it in the there pockets they try to take it.

When the principles take the phone they will try to make u wait until the parents get there but by that time the kids have convinces the parents that the teacher took it for know apparent reason. Then the parents get mad at the teachers. The principal starts getting all kinds of phones calls and complaints all because the teacher took the cell phone.

I know your thinking im just an 8th grader wanting to use my cell phone anytime i want to but its not like that al all. I fell its a very good reason why we should get to have our cell phone because everyone has one anyway and we cant always talk to our friends, they have other classes all the way down the hall way. If we not doing any school thing why not. i understand not having them in classrooms because they disturbed class if the ringer go off.

It has come to my attention that you are considering banning cell phones in school. Please do not do this. Students have a right to talk to their friends even if they aren't face to face. As long as students don't use them during class, there is no harm in using them at all. Students can't do anything with cell phones out of class that they couldn't do without them. It just makes talking with friends easier.

What's the difference between allowing students to text their friends and allowing them to talk to their friends? Maybe if a person doesn't have the time to see his friends between periods, he can just text them instead. It doesn't do any harm as long as you don't allow them in classrooms. It's not like you can cheat outside of a classroom. If they were to pass on answers to a test they could do it even without cell phones.

If a student doesn't use cell phones during class, then there's no danger of cheating. Even so, it's very easy to tell when someone is cheating. I highly doubt that someone is going to have the exact same answers as his friend by pure coincidence. Also, most people don't have a habit of looking down at their lap then immediately writing down an answer. Cell phones reduce the danger of cheating while making it easier to catch cheaters.

Lets face it, it's human nature to do what we are not allowed to do. There's examples of that throughout history. If you disallow cell phones, it's going to make more people use them, and in ways they aren't supposed to. If you allow them, people will be much more willing to follow the specific rules since they are still able to use them.

So, I do hope you consider my appeal to you. Cell phones aren't a bad thing as long as they are used correctly. They reduce the risk of cheaters and make those that do easy to spot. And remember, if you do ban them, people are going to want to use them even more.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

The ability to have cell phones on school campus is not the best idea. Kids can cheat on tests without the teachers knowing. Sometimes teachers trust the students that they wont text in class, but kids can break that rule. Yes, sometimes it is nice to have your cell phone out for a calculator (if you are allowed to use one) or even to call your parents if there is a big emergency happening at the school, but kids ruin the advantage that they get for being able to have their cell phones out.

Since I a' m a student at a SCHOOL_NAME, i think it will be awesome to be able to have your phones out during break times. The only thing wrong with that is kids will have their cell phones on in classes and text when they are not supposed to. If i was sitting next to a student that texts non stop during class time, it would be very annoying. So not only is it rude for students to text while their teacher is speaking, but also can be disturbing to students around the person that's texts while they are trying to do class work.

If you can only have your phones out during break time and not during class session that wont be a hard problem for some student to listen to. Some students will listen to that rule and teachers can trust them; but there are still students out there that will text during times that they are not allowed to.

In conclusion, students should not be allowed to have their cell phones on school grounds. If they were allowed to have their phones, then they would text during classes which is rude to the teacher; and they also won't learn anything if they were texting.

If you give students the chance to have a cell phone do you really think there just going to use it during learning lab or free time, no their going to be using it in all classes.

Instead of doing their work they are going to be texting on their cell phones besides doing their work.

do you really want that?

I didn't really think you did.

If you gave me that opportunity i wouldn't be focusing on my work, my head would be some where else.

another good reason is that cell phones could be going off all day without the students knowing it.

do you want to be walking down the hallways and all of a sudden you hear a thousand phones ringing?

I know i wouldn't.

As you probably already know about kids having a lot of friends and they text each other during school in the movies right? do you want that to be your school?

also you would probably be getting more complaints then you ever did if you change the cell phone policy.

Last but not least cheating with cell phones is a great way to cheat now a days. did you know that 60% of students now to this day cheat on quiz and test?

Where do you think they got they answers from?

Calculators and internet that is built into the phones.

Can you believe it? Well yeah I know for sure because, i was taking a test on Friday and this boy who sits next to me pulled out his cell phone and used his calculator that's on the phone to finish his quiz.

Still thinking about changing the cell phone policy?

Not only changing the cell phone policy bad, it's terrible.

why even think about something like that!

I just hope you don't change the policy because you would be doing harm to some people and great for less people. Think about it.

I believe that students should not be allowed to bring phones to school at all . Students may text in class and not get the full education they need . Phones are a distraction to students from completing work and it doesn't keep them on task . Phones take time away from learning and getting the education needed in a day in school .

Many students tend to use the phones and other devices during class hours , they usually tend to not complete the class assignments . If they do finish , most other answers come out wrong . Phones in school are a major distraction to all students and i believe they should not be allowed in school even if they are on or off because even if the students claim the phones are off , they can always turn it right back on . They may use it while their reading a book , which in this case their not . Students may be using the phone and not actually working or studying as they say they are .

Students might bring phones to school to use for an emergency , if so they can always contact their parents by using the school phones and contacting the teacher for help all so . Therefore , i agree with Policy 2 . Not to have phones in school at all . Its a complete distraction in class and it doesn't help in completing anything what so ever . Phones are one of the reasons why students usually fail a grade or have to retake classes in the next grade that they go to .",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
F4C26753B35F,"I think the 1st policy is better because kids should be able to have their cell phones because they want have to hide it anymore and, it can save teacher more class time instead of stopping then taking a phone that's like five minutes of learning the teacher just wasted. I like policy number one because we can deal with taking our phones out at free time. We also want to learn so we would turn the phones off. The teachers wouldn't have to worry about us talking as much because we would be able to text each other. We can study from our phones too that's another good reason why policy number one is the best. Another good reason we should have policy 1 because we might have to call someone if it's a emergency. Policy two is not the best because as i said earlier if a student gets caught with the phone during class time that stopping the whole learning process. Another reason why policy two is bad because what if someone had to call for a ride home and they didn't have their phone because the school wouldn't aloud that. So they decide to walk home and gets kidnapped. All of that could've been prevented if the school would've just aloud kids to have phones.

You have listed two possible policies about cell phones at school. The issue is common among all schools, considering that children are texting in class. You have presented two very common ideas about cell phone usage; the first allows students to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, while your second suggests banning students from having phones at school. While both ideas can be considered good, I personally believe that your first idea is the better of your suggestions.

If you ban the use of cell phones at school, it cannot stop the students from bringing them. You can stop children from using their phones on paper, but this would not stop them from using them. They could take out and use their phones when teachers are not watching, and use them without being noticed. And when somebody gets caught, they just get angry at the school and have their parents come up to the school to get back the confiscated phone. This will give you no progress, as students would still use their phones in class and just get them taken away. Even if they have the chance of getting caught, they would still text or call somebody if they felt that it was something important. also, students would have to use a school phone to contact a parent if they are sick or forgot something, and not all teachers allow students to use class phones. And if they do, a sick person might use the class phone, allowing the germs to spread, possibly putting other students at harm of disease.

If students are allowed to use phones some point in the day, then they might not use them as often in class. Students could then contact friends if they do not have the same free time as them, and are able to contact a parent or guardian if they are sick. This will cut down on students using class phones, and will help stop texting going on in class. If they believe they have the liberty to text during free times and lunch period, then they will be less likely to text in class. By giving them freedom, you are helping yourself because they are less likely to break the rules if they have something to tell their friends or family and they do not need to break the school rules to tell them really quickly. They would have time to do and say whatever they wanted to friends and family, and that would cut down on students getting in trouble during class. It would also reduce the amount of parents that have to come to school with complaints and to retrieve the item that was taken away.

This will allow students to fell as if they more freedom, treating them like adults. If they feel they are treated like a grown person, they might start to act like one. This could improve their studies if they stay more focused in class because they feel well respected. This could also help they pay attention more in class if they are not texting during the teachers lesson. The teacher can not always see if a student is texting, so the pupil could easily get away with it. During a free time, students would be able to get all of their important texts to their contacts, and be able to focus more in class. This will improve the grades of students, and help prevent students from being held back or failing a class. It could even keep kids out of trouble. If a student gets bored after finishing their lunch or while outside, then they could mess around and get in trouble. But if they were allowed the privilege of their phones, then they could avoid getting in by talking to their friends instead of goofing around.

Over all, I believe that banning phones from school is a bad idea. None of the students would follow the rule, and they would just bring them to school and hide them. This will get zero progress, and will create no change in the school environment. If you let students text during free time, it could keep students from texting during class, and help them focus more. By distracting the students while they are outside or have free time, it could prevent them from doing something to get them in trouble. And less people would be angry. You would not have angry students or parents coming up to the school to take back a confiscated item, thus not having to bother with any angry people. This is where I stand on the policies, but the final decision is up to you.",6,Cell phones at school,Independent,1.0

I believe that allowing student to bring phones to school and using them during lunch period and free time but as long as the phones are off during class time is a bad idea because what if the student don't listen to the policy and they have there phones out during classes and there texting during there class and when the teacher ask what is the answer to ""2836/847 they don't the answer how they be able to learn. Here's an example I think I can bring my phone to school and text, call, go on the internet go on facebook do what ever i want do and if it goes to far. That student will start to fail school and not doing the homework. That student will start going to classes. Then start skip school her so cool and popular. I also believe don't allow student to have phone at school at all is another bad idea because what if student needs to call home call someone else what if a group of student are walking to school and someone got shot how would they call the police if there phones are at home that student will be dyeing right before the other students eye what would you do.

I believe that policy 1 would be better for our school, because I think that students should be able to have their cell phones out during school hours and not get in trouble. Cell phones should be able to be used at school. Students should be able to have their cell phones out at lunch and during passing period. while in class people's phones should be on silent, so that it doesn't interrupt the class. Cell phones should be used at school in case of emergencies, and sometimes your family needs to get a hold of you at school. If the phones become a distraction the teacher or someone should tell the student to turn their phone off, but they shouldn't ruin it for the rest of the students. Therefore everyone else should be able to keep their phones out as long ass they are not a distraction. Most teachers have their cell phones out, so why wouldn't students be able to have theirs? It wouldn't be fair that a teacher can just answer their phone in the middle of class while a student has to have their phone taken away. What if that call the student was getting was for some kind of emergency? Then they wouldn't have been able to help out with what ever happened. I believe that all schools should allow cell phones out on campus during school hours. Cell phones can be used as a way of getting help at school, for example if you don't understand something, you could just text a friend for some help, and if your friend doesn't understand it either, that's when you know you should ask for help from the teacher. Another example of why cell phones should be allowed at school is because if a student were to see an intruder coming on to school grounds, and no other adult was there to see it, the student could just pick up their cell phone and call the office or if its really serious they could even call the police. When cell phones become a distraction, that's when the school staff should be allowed to take away the phones or at least tell the student to turn it on silent. Another example of why there should be cell phones allowed at school would be because of some kids that can't speak the same language as everyone else, they could text other students that speak their language and get help from them. If a student needs a book from the library, they could just text the librarian about the book that they need, instead of interrupting the class to go get a book from the library. If a student needs something from home, instead of interrupting the teacher during class, they could just text their mom and ask if she could bring what ever it is that they need from home. And that concludes the reason for letting students have cell phones out during school.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

82E21B844F8E,"To Principal TEACHER_NAME:

Cell phones have been in every household for the past couple of years.

They are completely changing not just communication, but ways of life.

I have heard that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy.

The policy right for our school is to not allow students to have phones in school at all because they cause a distraction, could get broken or stolen, and students can cheat easily with cell phones.

Initally, cell phones should not be allowed in school at all times because they cause a distraction.

If teens were allowed to have phones out during free periods and lunch time, almost everybody would be texting and talking on the phone.

With over one hundred people in the lunch room or just fifteen occupants in the library can become really loud.

Others around them may be trying to do work or study for an exam, but it will be difficult with the constant noise of cell phones.

Also, all this speaking and music that can be played on a phone will disturb classrooms nearby.

A teacher giving a lesson in the room next store will have a difficult time raising his or her voice to talk over the chatter close by.

To continue, it is safer to just keep phones off school grounds.

A person can drop his or her cell phone in the cafeteria and have it trampled on by many students walking around.

Phones can also get stolen by others.

Someone might take another student's phone out of jealousy, revenge, a joke, or a different reason.

The person who lost their phone could even go as far as pressing legal charges to the stealer.

Now this all seems like an ample amount of issues just to bring a phone to school, so it's better off left at home.

Next, phones can lead to students cheating.

Picture this: two students have a free period.

One is in the library studying for a big chapter test, and the other is eating lunch in the cafeteria.

The person eating just took the exam his friend is cramming for, so he helps out his buddy by texting him the answers.

The student in the library makes a pneumonic device to remember the multiple choice answers and he cheats on the test by doing so.

Even though the cell phones weren't used in the classroom, they still caused problems and took away from a teenager's education.

I agree that we should only let them take the phone if there using it in class but like when we are switching to are class we can talk or text for a min but when class starts then no cell phones. But are school we cant have are phones out until the end of the day and we have to wait until we get outside its like unfair.

If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy i think the best idea is to choose policy one. Policy one is the better choice to pick, not only is it more favored by the rest of the students, but it gives the students responsibility. Also policy two is a bad choice, not giving the students the right to have their cell phones is wrong when almost all of them has one. A rule like this is easy to break and many students will get into trouble. If you make it a rule that students can not have their cell phones at all, the students will bring them anyway and if they are already breaking a rule by just having them, most of them will break more of the rules and start using the cell phones. Policy two, i think, is a horrible choice. Policy one however, is an excellent choice. Students will be happy that they can have their cell phones and be able to use them in the time given.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
99149E7B5299,"Dear, Principal:

Students are obsessed with their phones. They use them 24/7. They use their phones to go on the internet, to text, to talk on the phone, to take pictures. Most students would go into a black depression if you took away their phones, while most would be drunk-happy if you let them use it during school. I believe that you should not let students use their phones during free periods.

To begin with, if you let students use their phones during free periods, that is all they will think about. Just last week, I was sitting in math class, bored to my skull. I was thinking about how next period, lunch, I would finally be able to use my phone to text my mother to bring me a cheesecake. Mmm, cheesecake. And so there I was, not hearing a word the teacher said, my eyes desperately glancing the clock every five minutes. Of course, since I was not paying attention, I didn't hear the teacher that we had a test tomorrow. The next day, I failed. Lucky me. Last Thursday, I observed a predicament just as mine. In language arts, I was writing a paper when I heard the tell-tale buzzzz of a vibrating phone. I looked over to witness my friend Kelsey hungrily staring at her pocket, wanting to know what her phone had alerted her to. Was it a text message? A missed call? What could it possibly be! I could almost feel her fingers itching to rip her phone out her pocket. Her curiosity was eating her alive, the poor girl. Since she was too pre-occupied with her phone, she didn't hear the teacher's five minute warning, and never finished her paper. All because of a buzzzz.

Furthermore, if students use their phones during free periods, they will be more tempted to use them during class. For example, it's just like eating food, or marshmallows. Since when do you eat just one marshmallow? You don't. Since when do you text only during lunch? You don't. You text through the next class, science, and then through history, and then, if you can, even through PE. Students will be less likely to put their phones away if they are already using them at the moment. To the students, it is cruel of you to let them use their phones for only a short, forty-five minute period. But what if you send a text at the end of lunch, only to get a response during class? You just whip out your phone, respond, and put it away. No big deal. But then what if they respond again? And again, and yet again? Then before you know it, you're caught up in a textversation. (text conversation.) Notice, this isn't lunch anymore. It's their precious, educational time that the students are using.

In conclusion, I believe that students should not be allowed to use their phones during free periods because they will not concentrate during class, and they will be more likely to using their phones during class. Oh, I just got a text message. Hold on, this'll just take a second.",6,Cell phones at school,Independent,1.0

I heard that you were reconsidering our cell phone policy and i truly believe that policy one is the best option regarding our cell phone policy. I believe policy one is the best decision because it is the year of 2011 and us students practically live off of technology. Cell phones are the only way that we communicate in our society. If cell phones are turned off during class periods then i do not see a problem. Having cell phones during free periods give us the opportunity to get in contact with our parents if needed. Sometimes after school activities are cancelled and then everyone has to go through the hassle of using your teachers phone in order to contact your parent. But if everyone had a cell phone on them during their free periods or lunch, then this would immediately eliminate the problem.

Another reason why I think that policy one is the best way to go is because some phones have internet access. Internet access can help us with our studies and finding information for a research project or a homework assignment. Although there are computers during free period, sometimes you are unfortunate and all the computers are being used. If we were aloud to use cell phones then more people would be able to get their work done during school. The last reason why i feel policy one is effective is because you can communicate with kids easily. Sometimes your friends do not have all the same classes with you and you maybe be in one class and they may be in another class somewhere across the school. If you have something important to tell them then you would have to search for them, but with cell phones you can easily just text them the important news. If you choose to pick policy one for our new cell phone policy, not only will you be making us kids the happiest kids ever but also you will be helping us a lot as you can see.

I believe that you should let teenagers bring their cell phones to school and contact people during their lunch period. You should do this because some teenagers might need their cell phone for after school activities. For instance, RELATIVE_NAME has baseball practice after school and needs to tell his mother that he needs to stay after. RELATIVE_NAME can't call from the office phone because their lines can't use that certain area code. So, in his case he can use his cell phone to call or text his mother and tell her that he has to stay after.

I do know that some teenagers will text during class, but that is up to the teachers to be paying attention to their students and not their computer or other activities. As you can see teens might need their cell phone in school for a useful reason, not just to text their friends. You will need to advise teachers will need to pay more attention to their students if you are going to come through with this idea. In the other free times and lunch period is usually the best time to contact people because you will not get in trouble for having a cell phone out. It is hard to hide a cell phone in class, in that case most teens will not try to hide it. Only few students will actually try to succeed; and it is fairly easy to tell when a student is texting.

In conclusion you should let teenagers have their cell phone at school but only be allowed to contact people with them in free times. Also because, even if you do say no cell phones allowed at all about 60% will still bring theirs in.

Cell phones should most definitely be allowed at school. Many kids have them, and many have the urge to use them. Principals should change the school policy about using cell phones during free time and passing periods. Most kids today have cell phones and would love to be able to text or call a friend from another school during their lunch break or free time. Kids have many things to talk to people about, but just don't always have the time when there busy talking to their other friends.

Being able to use cell phones at school would make kids much happier, and might even get the students to want to pay attention or learn more. When you give privileges to kids, they will be happy and will want to ""kiss up"" to their teachers so they can keep their rights of having their phone out during free time.

It makes plenty of sense only allowing them to use on their own time. I'm sure teachers wouldn't mind this rule as long as it will not disrupt class. Being allowed to use your phones at school would be the next big thing. Students would be super happy and would have way more fun at school than they usually do. If they do at all... not to say that school is not fun.

Personally, I would love to be able to use my phone at school. It would make school that much more fun for me. If I was allowed to use my phone on my own time, I would take full advantage of my opportunity. I would talk to my other friends from other schools who also would love to have the privilege.

Having cell phones at school is an important idea, because you have to think about the kids at school they need a phone for emergencies ,someone never knows if something will happen. Things happen for a reason. Another reason is that some students may forget their proper school tools and have to tell their parents that they need to bring them. Kids ask for permission for an example, they may need to call or text to tell them that they are going to stay after school for an exam or a makeup test. Some students don't feel good and they want to ask their parents to come, and pick them up.

Parents are caring for their child and think cell phones are the only way to keep them in contact, because if something happens to them they can call the police or mom and dad.

Our school should not ban cell phones. Cell phones are important to the safety of many students and is also a source of communication for students and their parents. There are many uses for cell phones other than to talk to friends.

One of these reasons is that if parents give a cell phone to a student it is probably because they need them to have it. If a student has to walk home alone it will reassure their parents if they know that they have a cell phone and they can communicate with them. If something important happens at a students home and the parents need to tell the student about it they can either call them at lunch or text them.

Another reason is that many students don't feel comfortable going to a teacher or other adults at school and telling them that they feel sick or something is wrong. Cell phones allow them to tell there parents directly and makes them more comfortable.

Some people may argue that there are phones at school that the students can use and that they should have their parents pick them up instead of walking home. They also may say that cell phones are a distraction in class.

Although these are good reasons, I think that it is a lot more difficult for a student to go up to a teacher and ask them to use the phone than to just call their parents on their own phone. Many teachers and nurses will ask a lot of questions about why they need to call and things like that and it makes students very uncomfortable to have to answer these questions. Also, many students have to walk home because their parents work or have to go somewhere.

As you can see, cell phones make students and parents feel comfortable and happy. They give students a way so communicate with their parents without being questioned by teachers.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

With our generation being so technologically advanced, I think we should use these tools to our advantage and not try to make them an enemy. By the time students of this school have their own families and jobs, the cell phone will be used everywhere and for everything, if they do not invent something even more advanced. I think that if you are still concerned about the students using their phones during school, you should put a bucket in every classroom where each student puts their cell phone in with their name on a post it note attached to the cell phone that is theirs. They use this strategic move in Congress when they are having a meeting and from my understanding, it seems to work. If students fail to follow this rule, the cell phone should no longer be a privilege to said student for the rest of the semester. I think that if we take away the cell phones completely the students will try and most likely succeed in smuggling them into school. There also might be some parents who are so outraged that they can not reach their child to tell them who is picking them up after school or if they are walking, that they will transfer their students to a different school district who allows them to use their cell phones. If I am right, you get a certain amount of money per student you have at school, so losing a couple of students not only mean losing a couple of bodies in the classroom, but also losing money that could be put towards furthering students education.

In addition most student would still bring there phones anyway. So would you rather have your students going behind your back and bringing there phones to school and text all threw school, or let them bring them to school and they only text during lunch.

Cell phones should be use lunch periods and other free times because if the kids use their cell phones at free periods they'll not use their phones during class. They will know that the only time they can use them is at free time. Also they are more likely listen in class and actully learn something.

Cell phones are fun so I guess that's why kids use them so much. Not all kids use cell phones to text or talk with their friends. Some kids use it for important things like if someone forgot their money at home and they couldn't eat cause they had no money. They would use their cell phone to call home and get the money ,but they call at free time. Not in class which if they did they would learn anything cause they were try to call during class and not after.

2B683EE1691A,"Students bring cell phones to school for either 2 reasons, 1 is for texting in class, and 2 is so incase something happens they can call there parents. I think it is ok for kids to bring there phones to school but if they are texting someone or playing with it in class you should take it right away because they aren't even aloud to play with it or text on it in class.

when they say to turn off your phones in class the students really don't turn them off they either hide it from you when it makes a sound, or they turn it on silent or on vibrate so when they get a text no one can hear it or if someone calls them.

My opinion is to allow students to bring there cell phones to school and to turn them off when in class but they should be allowed to use them if they need to, but would have to ask the teacher and they can only be calling their parents or any other close family members, or their guardian.

If they are not calling their close family members or parents then take the phone away and call their parents and tell them about it and tell the student to com get it from the office after school is over.

The reason I want to be able to have phones at school is so that we can have a way to call are parents with are phone because there might be something wrong.

If students can use phones during lunch periods and other free times they have, they might be taking out there phones in class and calling/texting there friend during class time. A student could be helping another student out during a test through texting ,so i wouldn't recommend policy number 1.

Policy number 2 has a good side and a bad side to it. The good side to policy number 2 is that they will not be able to communicate to other students during class time. But the bad side of policy number 2 is that they would not be able to call there parents after school to pick them up. So i recommend a policy number 3, which is: students should not be aloud to have phones out during school hours, they should be turned off, but they may take it out after school if they need to call someone. That way they will not be calling/texting any one during class, and if they are caught with the phone on, they should get it taken away until the end of the day . Then after school they will be able to call someone. Thank you for reading my letter, i hope you take my recommendation of policy number 3.

I think you should reconsider on the cell phone policy. I think you should allow us to have our cell phones on, and be able to play or use them during free time and lunch. As long as we turn the off when we are asked.

I think allowing us to have them on and use them, would increase the students in getting in trouble. Most people who are getting in trouble are using cell phones, and breaking the school rules. When i first got my phone taken up, i was VERY upset. I thought they couldn't take your cell phone cause they didn't buy them?

But i was wrong, and i figured out they could, because it's the county rules, not JUST your school.

Principal, you should really think about this and give us a chance, because it might work. And if it don't, change the rule back to; no cell phones. I'm pretty sure the students wouldn't mess up!

I understand that you are debating between two policies about cell phones. One of which would make the students very happy. The other would be popular with teachers and staff. Each policy would be popular with one group, and unpopular with the other. Both policies have their pro's and con's.

Policy one would allow students to have their cell phones out between classes and during any free time they have. This would be very popular among students. They like to be able to text or call anyone and talk to them. This would make the school day more enjoyable for the pupils. On the other hand this could lead to a higher percentage of cheating. students could text their friend the answers to a test in a class the student just had. This would upset teachers because they have to focus more on cheating.

Policy two would not allow students to have their cell phones at school. This would focus students more on school work. there would be less distractions. This would also not raise the percentage of cheating. However pupils would not like this policy. They want the freedom to text or call their friends. This would make the school day less enjoyable for them.

Weighing the pro's and con's of each i decide to pick the second policy. Students don't need to text their friends in school. What kids need is a good education. They cant do that if they are texting their friend about what they are doing after school. It may not be popular with the students, but it is the smartest decision. What ever they need to say, they can wait until they seem them or are out of school. That is what I think, at least.

Regarding the optional policies for the cell phone, I personally believe the second one is the best. Truth be told, if you allow students to bring them to lunch, that will just signal a green light to them that it's okay to ""text their buds"" during class. When students use their cell phones, you never know what they're texting about. Unlike notes, you can't just confiscate it and read it, because unlike scraps of paper, students can set a password lock on their phones. That means that they could be texting about drugs or sex, and even the answers to their science test without you knowing. Another problem is that students can hide their caller ID and cyber bully other students without them knowing who it is. Today, students can also access the internet on their phones and look up who knows what. Their also isn't a reason to let them use their cell phone during lunch because they will be able to talk to their friends there, so why the need to text them? Another issue is that the students are here to learn not chat with their friends, so the need for cell phones is at a low minimum. Though the use of cell phones should be banned, we should be able to keep them in our lockers in case of emergency or to call parents to pick us up after a school event.

It's time to take the initiative and end the madness here and now. Ban the use of cell phones during school, and help the students become responsible adults.

my first reason why is that kids would get in less trouble. they wouldn't have to sneak around and text or talk on the phone in class. they wouldn't have to always have to go to the restroom to call there mom or text a friend.

my second reason is what if something bad or embarrassing happens to you. what if u get sick or you fall into mud or you fall and hurt your self. then that is when you can use your phone to call for help our call your mom.

my third and final reason is what if you catch a bull or kids doing stuff there not supposed to. if you catch this stuff u can call the office or a teacher or even a principal.

then again people would say phones are a distraction or that if you need something go to the office. for kids its not that simple what if its really embarrassing it would ruin there reputation or there in a big problem.

I agree too policy 2. I don't think the kids should bring cell phones to school because if it vibrates while in class they might get too distracted , then they might pull out there cell phones and try to sneak them while the teacher is teaching. I honestly don't think kids should be aloud to bring any electronics too school.

Kids today are way different then back in time. They didn't have phones back then. So now the years have passed and all kids want to do is use there cell phones. They don't focus on school , they worry about the internet and drama and texting or on the phone. That's why the population of smart kids are going down. They make it seem like school doesn't even exist.

School is more important than talking on the phone. So yes i agree too policy 2 because, that's the problem now with kids. Well , if they bring there phones too school they have too make sure there on silence because most kids put them on vibrate. It might vibrate too loud.

Some kids are starting to make bad decisions , the only reason some kids have phones is because in case something happens. But you don't need your phone at school because , the school should already have your parents number if something was too happen .

Too me personally i think they should just stop bringing there phones to school. There's not a reason too bring it , that's what i don't get ! why bring it too school ? If i take my phone too school my phone stays on silence and in my locker , not in my pocket or anywhere else.

Parents just let there kids do any and everything. They should start being more protective. Because one day the kids are going to do what they want and not ever listen to what there saying. They will notice when there child starts too fail , they will realize taking there phone to school shouldn't be called for that's pretty much it, there parents will know letting them bring their cell phones too school is a bad idea.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I believe that policy two is the best choice. Students shouldn't be allowed to have cell phones in school at all. If you allowed them to use them during breaks, they would have them all the time. This includes during tests, in locker rooms, and during other important parts of class. If a student had their phone with them during class, they might think, ""Hey, I have it with me anyways, I might as well use it"". If this happened they could cheat on tests, distract other students, and send inappropriate photos to their friends. Students only want to use their phones during a boring lecture when they'd rather be talking to their friends. During breaks and lunch, they can talk to their friends in person, so there's no point in using a phone. The only way to stop students from using cell phones in class, is to not allow them in the school at all. There have been times, during class, when someone's cell phone has rung, and gotten everybody off task. The teacher stopped teaching and had to take the phone from the student. And all the kids started whispering about who's phone it was and why it rang. It ends up taking fifteen or twenty minutes to get everything sorted out. By that time the teacher forgot what they were talking about and the students were acting like animals in a zoo. Also, there have been cases where students have had their cell phone in the locker room and decided that it would be a good time to take an inappropriate picture and send it to their boyfriend or girlfriend. The only way to stop things like this and other things, like getting answers from a friend on the biggest test of the year, is to not allow cell phones in school at all. I hope you agree with what I believe and make the right decision.

D38815C5F013,"Dear Principal,

I think that policy #2 should be set. School is a place where students should go and learn not use phones and be distracted.

Maybe our school says yes to using phones then who are you supposed to text or call? Your mom or dad? That's the thing, you have no reason to use your phone. What if you leave it on a table during lunch and someone steals it? Or maybe your sitting outside with your friends and you loose it. You don't want to have to face the consequences from your parents.

Another reason is your education. Being a student I know what other student would do if you gave them the privilege if having it during the day. Sure you'll tell them to turn it off but think about it, do you honestly think they would? Backing up that is the fact that a student could be texting during class. And once they start, they wont stop. Pretty soon they would have missed the whole lesson, and that wont be fun when a test or their report cards come home. A student could miss the tardy bell because they were too interested in texting their friend.

Setting the first policy, is setting the start for a child's failure in any subject. Say your a principal and also a parent, would you want your child to fail because they wanted to text their friends saying ""What's up?"" No parent wants their child to fail, and no principal should either.

I think that having cell phones at lunch periods and at other free times such as locker break would be better in ways students could communicate with other class mates with work needed to be done and needs help reviewing, but having cell phones at school could tempt other students to text or call their parents to pick them up for early dismissal or a feign sickness.

Having cell phones at school would be crucial to school functioning because students would abuse the rule and do unneeded things at school such as ""sexting"" sending hurtful messages through other people to start a rumor.

Some people might get in fights and grades would probably decrease because people would be obsessed with texting.

In a worst case scenario the school could get sued by a student getting a white slip, detention, ISS, suspended, or expelled and disagree about doing the wrong thing they did or if they where given it through ""hard feelings"" between a teacher and a student.

also some parents want their kids to take their cell phones incase for an emergency. and so that students could call their parents incase they forgot something. further on after their free time is over you can take every student to their locker and make sure they don't have their cell phones so they wont use it during class periods.

I think that because students should be able to have cell phones to school. They should be aloud to have them during free times because they would not be a distraction to anybody because they have nothing to focus on well other than what they are doing. Students would be much happier in the halls if you allowed them to have cell phones.

Another reason would have to be if a student had to get a-hold of there parents because of an emergency, but were not able to have phones.

There are many kids with health problems. What if some kid had to take medicine and forgot to? There are many problems that could happen to a student and they would need to talk to their parents but were not able to get the help they needed. Yes you could get help from a teacher, but if it is something that a teacher did not know what to do, you could have a lot of problems there.

Maybe a child will have like a die heart emergency!? as of now we have to pay a quarter no matter what!! But, if we can have our phones then we can use it for those times.

I think you should use Policy 1 and allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. It would give students a way to communicate to each other, but also allow them to focus on their work during class. If any student is caught using their phones during class, you can take their phone away as a warning. It also gives students a way to communicate with their parents if anything goes wrong at school. For example if a student forgot something at home and they need their parent to drop it off at their school, they could use their cell phones to contact them. Or, if a student isn't feeling well and they need to go home, they can contact their parent to bring them home, with permission from the health teacher or other school staff.

I think that giving students a chance to use their phones during lunch period and free times will make them more eager to come to school. Allowing cellular usage will help them to see that you can trust that they will follow the school rules. And making sure they turn their phones off during class to make sure their focused in class is an excellent idea. It gives students the freedom they want, and the chance to communicate with friends and family. Whether its for emergency or recreational purposes, they will be satisfied and grateful for the privilege to use their phones at school. I also think that allowing them to use their phones will help them to get their mind off of school work and help them to relax for a little bit. And when they return to class, their minds will be refreshed and ready to learn something new.

Students will be happy to know that they won't be restricted to use their phones during free time and lunch, and a majority of them will probably want to keep using their phones at school, so its a definite possibility that they will follow the rules.

First off, I think the students at your school should be able to use phones at school during lunch periods and other free time because students might need to call their mom for something. Like one time at school I forgot my lunch and I didn't have a cell phone to call her so I went to the front office because they had a student phone to call your parents But there is only one phone and there was at least four students in front of me trying to call. So I waited about a half hour. When I got back to the classroom my teacher said I missed her whole lesson.

Very few people can deny that we will in a Cyber World. Everything today is pretty much technology. You can't go anywhere without seeing people on their cell phone whether its calling, texting, or on the web. I go out to dinner with my family a lot and there is always people in the restaurant on there phones. In my opinion people are addicted to using technology. I know very few people that don't have cell phones, it's extremely rare for someone to not have a cell phone today.

Cell phone use is excepted in many places, almost everywhere except school. A lot of kids use their cell phones in school whether its aloud or not. I saw cell phone use a lot when I was in 7th grade more than I do this year. There is so much kids can do on a cell phone these days it's hard not to have them with you all the time.

I personally think cell phones should be aloud in school. What's the harm of texting during lunch or during or a study hall? I don't see any harm. I think if we had phones aloud in school the detention rate would go down because people wouldn't be ""illegally"" using there cell phones during the school day. Having your cell phone with you could be a very good thing for example, what if there was an emergency at home and your parents couldn't reach you. If there was an early release at school we could easily contact our parents at home or work to let them know we are getting out with school early.

With cell phones in school comes big responsibility's for students, they would have to resist texting during class when it wasn't aloud. A good plan would be in classes that texting isn't aloud the phone would have to be silent on there desk where the teacher could see it.

Cell phones these days are very advanced and could benefit kids greatly. They could look information up if teachers aloud, on their phones. If some kids misused their phones in school teachers could just revoke privileges. Schools could make it so if students got in any kind of trouble all cell phone privileges would be provoked for a period of time.

With having cell phones in school comes a few minor problems. Would kids without phones be less benefited? Would kids text each other test answers before a class?

I think cell phones in schools would be a good thing in my opinion. It could reduce money for schools because we wouldn't be using textbooks as much because we could look up information up on our phones without going to a computer. If we didn't use textbooks as much they wouldn't get damaged as often so the schools wouldn't have to buy then all that often.

E9739967700C,"I prefer policy 1 because i think we should be able to use are cell phones at lunch and other free times and because sometimes it gets boring at lunch and i just feel like texting as long as its turned off in class i think we should have them and i think that its crazy because were almost grown and we still have to put phones in the lockers and another reason why i think we should have phones is because what if the school or something happen to the school i wont be able to keep in touch with her and i think some boys try to get a girl number at lunch time so we should have are phones instead of waiting until the afternoon so i can write it down on a slip of paper and i think we should because and because what if we are sick or don't feel good and the teacher wont let us go to the nurse then i should be able to text my mother and tell her that im sick can you come pick me up or bring me some medicine and having a phone in the lunch is phone because when you just feel like you don't wont to be bothered then you can plug in some earphones to your phone listen to music and eat so yes TEACHER_NAME

I am a student at our school and I have some thoughts on the polices that you and the school administrations will be imposing over the next weeks. It is my belief that it would be in the best interest of all the students and teachers if no cell phones where allowed during school hours under normal circumstances. I think this is the correct option because, while at school a student's mind should be on the work he or she has been assigned and the job of keeping his/her grades up. Cellular devices are a distraction from school work and assignments they keep a student occupied with social activities and interaction rather then the grades and assignments that the student has been assigned. Also a cell phone is not only a distraction for students but a hazard. Imagine if you will how hard it is carrying all your books and other school related items without distraction then amagin your cell phone going off in your pocket, of course you answer it but while pulling the phone from your pocket you trip and fall. it is much easer to fall and drop books or food while talking on a cell phone.

There is however one exception to the general rule of no cell phones. that is in the case of an emergency, such as a fire or a hostage situation. Since these are risks that must be taken into account. I propose a compromise between the two extremes. Student should be allowed to keep there phones on their person as long as they are turned off at all times during a regular school day. this then creates the problem of students texting during school hours and class so I propose that students who are caught texting or using the cell phone during school our not in the case of an emergency should have there phones took away for a set amount of time. much like if a student does something wrong he/she is punished with a certain amount of time.

I thank you for taking the time to listen to my thoughts,

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I believe that you should allow us kids to have our cell phones out at school for many reasons. Let me tell you some reasons why you should let us bring our cell phones.

My first reason would be is because if our parents call or text us something that's important, well then we need to check and see what they said. Maybe it is something we need to do for one of our classes, like a missing assignment. Maybe we forgot our lunch at home and our parents are telling us that they are coming to drop it off to us. It is very important that we know these kind of things. Now this is just one reason, but there are plenty more.

My final reason would be what if we wanted to talk to someone that we are not seeing at the time. It would be great if we could check up on them and see how they are doing, just so we are in contact with them. It would be great if this happened because then once class started we would put them right away and start focusing on our learning. I don't think anyone would get in trouble during classes if this happened. I mean we would all be excited if we only have them out for a little bit of time. I could care less how long we could have them for as long as we are able to show them.

Thank you for your time and I hope you consider my idea, your student,
