I believe not allowing students to bring their cell phone to school is the best police because many student get distracted during classes, they don't finish there work , and they don't pay attention in class their suppose to do.

There are many cases in where a student get distracted in class and doesn't know what the teacher is teaching or talking about most of the time. They have their cell phone in their pockets and they stat texting their friends. At the end when the teacher asks the students question about the lesson many students wont be able to answer the question because their distracted on there phones. They wont be able to understand at all.

The second reason I think you shouldn't allow students to bring there cell phones to school because the majority of the time the students don't finish their work. they find excuses to go to the bathroom and talk on the phone. They tell the teacher many excuses so they wont get a bad grade. At the end of the day they get what they get because of their cell phones.

Many times of the day when a student gets home and they have to do home work they don't know how to do it or how its suppose to be done because they don't pay attention in the class.

They text they get on the internet and the get distracted they didn't pay attention in class so the don't have 100 percent material other students have because the didn't listen to the teacher when she was talking.

in conclusion the best thing to do is to bad cell phones from school and not let kids bring it from home.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Firstly I believe that you should allow students to have their phones during lunch periods and other free times.

I believe this, because when I went to SCHOOL_NAME for my seventh grade year we were allowed to have our phones during lunch and other free time as long as it was in are lockers during classes.

Also then if students needed to call their parents to come and get during the school day when they couldn't remember their parents number, they could get a hold of them.

Secondly when students are allowed to have their phones during lunch and other free time the students most likely to keep their phones in their lockers during classes, because when I went to SCHOOL_NAME the student who had phones in class was less.

That was a good thing so the teachers could go through all the lessons they had planned for this class period.

And thirdly then there was less students getting in trouble, and less cell phones getting taken away from the students.

That is why I believe that student should be allowed their phone during lunch and other free times, thank you for your time.

I think students should be allowed to have their cell phones at school.

it would be okay if students used them during their free time at school.

If there is only a school phone it could lead to problems with only one phone available.

Students should have their phones so that if there's an emergency they will be able to call their parents or the police.

It would be okay for students to have cell phones at school but as long as its not during class time , only during free time.

It could be good idea for students to have a cell phone at school.

If a student would get caught using a cell phone in class it should be confiscated.

So cell phones could be a good and bad idea but, students should be allowed to have their cell phones at school.

Our generation relies on technology to get news and to stay in touch with others.

So, i hope you decide and pick policy 1 so the students can bring their cell phones to school.            ",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

It has come to my attention that you are considering a new cell phone policy. From the two you are choosing of I think that it would be in the best interest of the students to allow them to bring their cell phones but only to use them at lunch or free periods. The reason being is that at lunch time the students would be able to text or call their friends without disrupting any classes. Second is that students need their phones in case of an emergency. If they forgot to tell their parents to pick them up early that day then they would be able to call them to tell them.

Also I think that if you banned cell phones you would have an even bigger problem than before because knowing that they would get into trouble the students would use their phones in class very discretely so that the teacher wouldn't see. So if students follow the cell phone policy that they are allowed to bring it but only when allowed, I think that the students will be happy, the parents will be happy, an you will also be happy.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
C519FD18B620,"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think you should allow students to use cell phones during lunch for a few reasons. One reason is that kids always bring their phones to school and use them in class because they feel cool and if you allowed some usage of their phones I think the amount of kids using their phones in class would go down.

Also in lunch we are not allowed to get up and move tables, which causes some kids to not see or talk to some of their other friends, but if you allowed cell phone usage then kids could talk to all their friends and everyone would be happy. My greatest and final reason is that some kids could text their parents or relatives and ask if they could bring something up that they may have forgotten at home before their next class.

If you allowed some cell phone usage I believe kids would listen better in class and kids would enjoy school more. Being able to talk to all your friends is a good thing because they can tell you what your doing in a class that they might of had before you. Also if you are having a bad day your friends can help you get through it and if you cant talk to them they can't help you. Being able to text my mom and ask her to bring up something before my last classes would be nice, I have forgotten things before and since 8th grade has a no late work policy i got zeros on the work.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
551BB83EEF11,"Dear, principal

The principal should go with policy one for many reasons. One of those reason is because in case of an emergency or your mom need to call you because something happened to you. Also the other reason the principal should go with policy one because if the students have free time with there phone they would not have to use it in class.

If there was a fire in the school and the students needed to call there mom or dad right away and there was a no phone policy in school then they would have no phone to call there parents. Also if the parents are trying to reach them for something very important ,and the school has a no phone policy rule in school then there parents would have not reached them and they would have missed the emergency call.

The other reason is because if the student have the free time with there phone for 20 through 30 minutes on there phone then they will use out there phone, and there phone will run out of battery so they can not use it in class or it would not go off. also if the phones do go at class the teacher could just take it, and give it back when class ends.

Those are all the reasons that the principal should go with policy number one.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
7C1EAA5096AC,"Dear Sir or Madam,

I believe that if you are reconsidering the cell phone policy for our school you should choose Policy 1. I think this because if our phones are off in class but during our lunch break and other free times that are longer than switching time we could have them on than school would be a better place to be, for students anyways. As long as we're not texting friends answers to test, then what could be the harm?

If we're not allowed to have phones at school at all (even if their off) and something bad happens, like the school catches fire or something, we would need a way to contact our parents quickly. Tell them what happened, assure them everything is fine, tell them we need a ride home because school can't continue because of what happened. Information like that wouldn't get through very fast. With a couple teachers phones and many, many students. We could pass the information faster if we had our own phones.

So by choosing Policy 1, you would be making many students, parents, and maybe even a few teachers happy. If you would consider what I've said we all (the student body) would appreciate it.

To whom it may concern. I hereby say that you should go along with Policy number 2. The reason i go along with Policy number 2 is because, with cell phones during school kids get distracted easily and you may never know they can text behind your back. With cell phones during school many kids don't seem to care or even acknowledge that they have work to do or they have homework. This can also bring most of the kids grade down and it will effect the school and their education. Wait hold up, you want to know one reason that will really blow your head off that when your finishing reading this sentence automatically you'll be like ""heck nahh Policy 2 is what I'm going to pick.""

lol yup i know I'm funny. Well getting back to the letter. I am totally against Policy 1 which is to allow students to have their phones whenever they want but, to turn it off when their inside of class. Many students and im not going to lie I am one of the few, we intend on texting behind the teachers back. Then as soon as the teacher look back to speak or to tell us something quick we put our phones away so we won't get caught. You want to know what the funniest thing is, its that the teachers don't even have a clue about what their doing and I myself laugh behind their back because the teachers are so full of it. That it's not even funny.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
7F87920E2DFA,We should be allowed to have cell phones at school during the free periods. We should get to have them when ever we like and we should be allowed to have them on during class as long as they are on silent or something as long as the teacher doesn't hear them on and doesn't see them out. People take phones out when they are at lunch or something when we not in class or around a lot of teachers. So we should be allowed to have them because we need to use them when parents or friends need to find us if we're not around or can't see them outside waiting for us. And if teachers can have phones out during class or at free time we should to. Just to be fair for everyone. But for the people who don't have phones if there friends say then they should be able to use them as well. So I think it a good idea to have cell phones out during the free times and at lunch so we can still talk to friends that are not in the same classes or lunch times as us. But if we can't have cell phones at school then we wouldn't know when the parents are picking us up or if they or coming to get us right after school is out and sometimes people need them to text there parents to see if friends can come over or if they can go home with there friends.,2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

Dear principal,

I see that you want to reconsider two possible polices about the cell phone.

The policy that I think is better is actually both i think that students should be able to use cell phones during free time. Not during class time also i understand that many students like to use their phones a lot which you should may consider to let them use their during at least lunch or free time but not during classroom time which is very important for the students education. To learn for example when your done with a test and you have free time to text ,call ,and etc. While other students may lose concentration during their test so its better to use their cell phones during at least lunch or other free times but not in class or other important event that is happening during school time cause that is really disrespectful. Also it would be unfair that students aren't allow to have a phone. For example if their is an emergency and no one has a phone and it will cause a problem to the school .Which I consider at least a little of both policies. So you want to consider at least policy 1 and a little of policy 2 of which I want to consider you a policy3 and in this policy you may to use your phone during lunch or any free time but can't be use during class time or any important events happening during school unless its and emergency of some kind. And students would be able to have their phones cause you never know something bad would happen.

F4003A737E0A,"Dear Principal,

I agree with reconsidering the school's cell phone policy to policy one. This way students can use their cell phones during free times at school, and not using their phones during class. A cell phone is nice to have to do certain things that could help you during your day at school. If there is an emergency a cell phone can call for help. Students also should have cell phones with them in case if something in their day changes and they need to call a parent, the other way around. If the cell phone policy changes so that students can have their cell phones out during certain parts of the day I believe that students will not do all of their texting in the middle of a class. Since certain students will still text in class the only way we can fix that problem is take away their phone privileges during school. This way students know that if they text in class and abuse this privilege there will be consequences. Most cell phones now have calendars or a place to schedule things. Since most kids would prefer having their phone with them instead of a planner, they can put all of their assignments in their phone schedule instead of a planner.

This helps students stay organized and probably help them plan out their weeks. Those are my reasons for reconsidering the cell phone policy to policy one, so that students are able to use their cell phones during certain parts of their school day. Doing this could benefit parents, students, and teachers throughout a school day.

The majority of students in middle and high schools are glued to their cell phones everywhere they go. Even though they are used to text friends frequently, they are also important to scheduling. I think the policy best suited for our school would be the first policy. Cell phones are often necessary to determine whether or not a student can get home after school, to schedule after school activities, and to make plans with other students. To take away all of their right to use a cell phone during school hours would limit them to not being able to do this while eating lunch or having a free period.

If a student is unsure if their parents can pick them up from school or not when they aren't taking the bus, it is necessary to contact either their mom or dad to see if they can get home quickly after school ends. Sometimes, when a student isn't able to call a parent, they end up waiting for an hour or more outside the school until he/she is picked up from school. Students need to be able to use cell phones for situations like these, especially when they much homework to complete for school because then they have less time to do their required work.

Another reason why students should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and free times is because many are involved with some sort of after school activity. Whether it's a sport, musical instrument, or anything else, events within that activity are often scheduled last minute or without the student knowing days ahead of time. When this happens, they may not have transportation to the location if it is not held at the same school. In this scenario, students should be able to contact a parent or friend who can drive them to wherever they need to be.

The last reason why I think you should choose Policy 1 is because students need to take a break from working constantly and make plans with friends. Students have so much homework to do when they come home from school, and sometimes it can become overwhelming. Students need to be able to spend time with friends after school and not be always thinking of all the work that needs to get done by the next day. Taking a short break is helpful and make them feel less stressed about their schoolwork. So, students should also be able to use their cell phones to call or text friends to schedule activities together. They can even study for an upcoming test or quiz together, so they can get a higher grade.

Overall, Policy 1 is a better policy because it still allows students to sometimes contact others with their cell phones. Today, cell phones are used by the majority of Americans multiple times. To take away their cell phones wouldn't be right. In some situations, students need them to call or text others to help them for whatever. Policy 1 works best because they have the chance to contact parents or friends when they need to, but they won't get distracted during class when they are turned off. This policy allows them to take care of anything they may need to, yet still be able to focus in class.

Your first policy sounds great because many students now are sneaking in their stuff inside the school and teachers are not really great at looking for stuff.

If you allow them to have their cell phones in school might be great because they may change ideas and their parents might be waiting for their son to pick them up.

It might lower how much they cheat off of another person.

Of course if those two persons are at free time at the same time.

My opinion is that the teachers pick up their cell phones before class this might be bad if they steal them.

Cell phones in school might also increase the probability of catching the cheaters by looking in the cell phone memory.

The thing they should do is that all students have free time at the same time so that they do not try to cheat in class.

You should try this for one year and if your satisfied with the results you may do it again.

You may tell the students at the beginning of the school year that the cell phone privilege will be taken away if they don't follow directions and apply policy #2 those are my opinions.

Maybe some students don't have cell phones and don't want other students to have them.

I think just about every student would like to have their cell phone in school and you might eve add more privileges if they do it right for so many years they may bring MP3 games and other electronics so that they feel almost like at home.

If any students breaks the rules they may not bring the cell phones and the other privileges you might have gave them you can tell the teachers which students are not allowed to bring electronics and if they see them with a electronic they can take it away.

If it was a borrowed electronic the student the borrowed from gets taken away the privilege as well.

If so many students are breaking the rules than put policy #2 for the rest of the year.

The next year you may start fresh if you feel like it .

You might want to think the cell phone policy a little bit deeper if you have any doubts.

That is what I have to say respect the cell phone policy.

Many students are waiting for this policy to come true.

Please think about it.

Some teachers might not like it.

I think you should not allow students to have there cell phones at school. This is because cell phones are a big distraction to have during school hours.

Also because there is no reason for a student to have there cell phone at school. Another reason is that students could cheat on tests if they have there cell phone.

One reason why i think you should not allow cell phones is because they are a big distraction. even if you would let them use it at free times they would still have it in class and they would be able to text during a lesson or something else. This would affect there learning because they wouldn't be paying attention. If one of the students are texting another student in another class is texting too, so that is two people who are not paying attention.

Another reason would be that students shouldn't even need there cell phone during school hours. The only reason would be if they need to call a parent. Even then they should go to the office to call there parent if they really need to. they should not be allowed to call anyone they want though. Also if a student wants to text another student they could just talk at free times.

Lastly students shouldn't have there cell phones because they could cheat on tests or other assignments. Them having there cell phone could help them by them using it as a calculator or they could send messages to other students in the class and ask for answers. At times teachers do catch it but other times they don't.

In conclusion i do not think you should allow students to have there cell phone during school hours. If students have there cell phones it could be a distraction, a way to cheat on tests, and students could call with them when they should go to the office to. Students do not really need there cell phones at school at all.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
0A7A8F866208,"To the Principle

My recommend is the policy number one cause if they are going home on the bus they would have to call there parent to check in especially if they are walk even if its only ten minutes from your house you still have to call your parent or guardian or who ever takes care of you.

But only during free time like lunch cause you might be on one side of the building your friend might be on the other side, but if you like texting or communicating like answers for a test or a regular quiz.

texting in the library is ok if your doing the same thing like home then its kinda ok cause your helping each other out. Or maby there was an accident at school and you would have call a guardian, its like a safety precaution your safety is your number one priority.

But at the same time, policy number two is also a good one cause student would either talk or text instead of school work so if you take away there cell phones the student would be doing there work instead of playing around with there cell phones.

That would mean the grade levels would go up unless they find another way to communicate like letters or secrets note or some thing.

8ECC067F27E1,"I think policy 1 is the best way to settle students with cell phones. For example, some kids play sports and have long practices after school and they need someone to pick them up. If they don't have their cell phone with them they have no way to get a-hold of their parents. As long as students phones stay in their backpacks and they are turned off so that they don't disturb class it should be fine. They should only be able to use them in free time when not doing work and have permission by a teacher. If the students start to abuse these rules then that should be when cell phones are no longer allowed in school. If a student was to get sick and need to get in touch with his\her parent they could use their cell phone , but only if given permission by a teacher. That would keep a lot of students from all coming in the office to use the phone to call parents. Exam time is when we have a lot of parents to come check out kids and some kids forget to tell their parents the time. If students could use their cell phones during necessary times then students could text or call their parents. Being able to use phones here at school would save the school , teachers , students , and parents a lot of time. Parents wouldn't have to call the school to say that their child needs to ride bus 07-2 for example they could just text their child and save the people in the office some time. We all know that you and the vice principal have a lot of running around the school to do during the day. If we was to get out of school early for bad weather one day parents could text or call their children to tell them where to go or get off that day. That would save a lot of phones calls and confusion on those day. In every school no matter where it is located students bring their phones to school everyday. Why not let them use it and not get into trouble? Students sneek their phones to call and sometimes they go off and they get took up and parents have to waste time to come get them. Letting students use them would save parents from having to come down here and waste gas on a cell phone. I have given you my main reason why I believe cell phones would not just help but save us some time.

I have heard that you have been reconsidering the cell phone policy on your school. And that is not something I blame you for, considering that the student body have been using their phones when the teacher is giving lessons. If I were the principal, I would have pick Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

You must look at their perspective. If you have picked Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all, what would the students think? They would think, ""Why did the principal outlawed cell phones in our school?"" They would then, protest to it and at one point in time, would rebel against the school.

But let us remove that scenario out of our minds and think about the people who doesn't uses their phones during class time and only uses it during where class is not being taught?

Yes, that by removing phones in the school students would be probably, paying more attention to lectures, but did you ever consider that they would also not pay attention? They would not pay attention to the class because it would be a sign of rebellion that cell phones should be allowed, not illegal.

Also, what about where the student is sick and wants to be pick up during lunch? Maybe one of the staff would see her taking out her cell phone and confiscate it and the student would get more sick, who will probably not attend school, the following day. So you see, dear principal, it is best to have Policy 1, instead of Policy 2. Student will still have their phones, but at least it would not be during class time where they would pay attention.

It has come to my attention that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I strongly agree with you. Cell phones are something that are very important to have during school. If cell phones are allowed during lunch periods and other free times it would be a good way for student to plan out homework assignments, students would be able to use them during emergency situations, and it would help students learn responsibility.

Many students have a problem with being unorganised. They never want to use their agendas or plan out any type of homework assignments. If students were allowed to use their cell phones, they would be more likely to plan out assignments on their phones. Every phone has a notepad tool wear they can write reminders. Students would feel cool writing down assignments on their phones, and would do it a lot more often. This will help students to stay on top of things.

Also, cell phones can help during emergency situations. Many parents like their children to have a phone with them at all times incase of an emergency. This would not only satisfy students by allowing them to have cell phones, but also their parents because of this reason. Even though they do have phones in the office, some things students would rather say in private. This way they could go to the bathroom to tell their parents.

Lastly, it would teach students responsibility. Keeping up with a cell phone requires a lot of work. Students will have to become more responsible to keep up with their phones at all times. Responsibility is a very important quality to have; this is an excellent way to teach it.

As I have made perfectly clear, I think allowing cell phones is a great change to make to our school. Students, teachers, and even parents will all appreciate it. Please think about everything I have said when you decide to change the cell phone policy or not.

I think principals should let students keep their phones with them at all times in case of an emergency. I think that because there has been a lot of things that have happened in the past where someone goes into the school and starts shooting everybody. So if one of these days that happens someone that has their phone with them can call 911. Although, I hope this doesn't happen anytime soon. I also think that if a student is caught texting their teacher may have the right to take the phone away until further notice. I think principals should allow students to keep their phones with them at all times, EXCEPT during a test, or TAKS test.

Students should be held responsible if they are caught texting or calling someone during class, and the teacher takes their phone away. I also believe that teachers should NOT text during class. Because they are just giving students bad examples. Therefore, teachers should also get into trouble if they are texting or calling people from their cell phones!

Students should have this right because, in case of emergency they should be able to get them out and call for help at any time, parents need to have a way to get a hold of there children fast and easy during free times, and teenagers deserve to have your trust in them to not use them during class and to have them turned off. Some examples of why you need to have it at free times are that maybe your mom needs to let you know you need a different ride home, or if something happened in your family. It is a good idea to let students bring phones to school, but with rules, come responsibility.

If i student should be at lunch and a fight breaks, you know you have to stop it or tell someone. You assume you may get hurt trying to stop it, and your too far away from the office, you should use your cell phone and call the police or a staff member at your school. better to be safe then sorry. Imagine if you didn't have your cell phone and you tried to break up the fight and you got hurt, or you tried running to the office, and while you were taking time to run someone got really injured. For safety purposes, it is a good thing to have your cell phone on campus.

Assuming one of the reasons your parents bought your cell phone is because they need to get a hold of you as fast and as easy as possible. Wouldn't you wan to know if you needed to get a ride home after school so you wouldn't be stuck there by yourself, or even if your mom or dad was seriously hurt? Or simply, your mom just wants to know how your day is going. Students parents have a right to be able to reach there children during free time at school.

In this point of our lives, facility members of a school should be able to trust there students to stow the phones away and turning them off. Students parents have taught them manners, respect, and obedience, why not test it out? This can teach students even more obedience and respect for there teachers, and maybe bosses in the future. By getting use to this early on, they won have a problem with it later. Although some people say students may sneak a little texting here or there, which is wrong, but changeable by, reprimanding them, which may help the problem. Teachers and principals should trust students to have there cell phones off during class.

It is a reasonable choice to let students have there phones working at lunch or nutrition, but expect to have them off in class. Three reasons why this is a good thing is for emergencies, for there parents to have a easy way to get a hold of them, and to let the students know we trust them. These students are growing up, there going to have jobs, and way more responsibilities in the future. This may get them ready for that challenge.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8

Lots of people have cell phones for no purpose. Some people also have cell phones for a purpose. Some people have cell phones because it is fun to text in class, while other people have cell phones because they need to call their parents or plan something with their friends outside of school. I am trying to say that it is not a good thing to allow people to text or call in class, but people should be allowed to do it a little bit so they can connect with their parents or form a party. Basically, I am all for policy one.

Kids are usually allowed cell phones because their parents want to connect with them. What parents don't know is what the kids do when they get the cell phone. Some kids obey the rules and call their parents once in a while, and they don't distract themselves and other people in class by texting. Other kids, on the other hand, don't care about calling their parents and text in class, distracting themselves, and other people. That's when policy one comes in. Kids won't be able to distract themselves and others in class, and they won' t be able to text at lunch either because they want to eat. Maybe, they might even call their parents for once and tell them what's happening.

For the kids that follow the rules, this should be easy. They are already doing what policy one is all about. They already know that they would distract other people by texting in class so they don't do it. They already call their parents during lunch to communicate. You shouldn't worry so much, principal, for policy one works for everyone, even you.      ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I know that you are thinking about cell phones i think we should be able to use them while it is lunch, after school, or before school. We can use cell phones not just for texting calling, and games we can use them for our education.

Not everyone uses cell phones in class and i think it would be fair if they were able to bring their cell phones to school, and turn them off.

Students in class will like to use their cell phones for many things, but they know that they will be taken away for being used in class or in front of a teacher.

the only downside to me is moms will have to spend more money when it comes to the phone bill.

I f students use them in a bad to often then the privilege should be taken away from them.

On the other hand some people do use their cellular phones for bad things like texting, and internet so that could be the reason you wouldn't allow cell phones.

even though we use cell phones every day at school should not be the place for phones school is for learning. Not for texting on phones.

If cellular phones are used the school could get in trouble for letting students use them.

It would also ruin our reputation as a school so don't allow cellular phones.

in the end cell phones should not be used at school because kids would get distracted by them and not learn the things they need to .

cell phones do three bad things to the body first it rots your eyes. Then you get stuck texting forgetting proper spelling. Last it gets you in trouble for not having good grade in school.

Allowing cell phones at school is like allowing kids to bear arms they both will eventually ruin a kids life.

The kids in our school have more than enough time to use phones, and if you let them use it at school they will become more defiant, and disrespectful so TEACHER_NAME

9590080E51AB,"Dear Mrs. Principal,

I know this has been a difficult week for you. There are lots of people at this school and all of them have opinions. Some people think cell-phones should be allowed at lunch and break but not during class. Still others think they should be banned at school. I think the second group is right , they should be banned at school. I think this for many reasons.

The first reason is that cell-phones are commonly misused. If you tell them they can have them at lunch, they will be out during class. This will cause all sorts of problems. Give them an inch and they will take a mile. Texting during class will become a huge problem. In turn grades will go down because students are not paying attention in class and will miss important information. You can not ignore this. In summary, because students would misuse them cell phones should be banned at school.

Another reason is that talking at lunch would go down. Instead students would text. Student without phones would be left out of these conservations. These conversations would unwatched by teachers. Students could say whatever they want. Fights could be caused and happen on phones without any teachers knowing it. Inappropriate messages could be sent. All these things would cause dissention and problems among students. For this reason cell-phones should be banned at school.

Lastly cell-phones are small and easy to get lost. A student could misplace it very easily at school. There are tons of places where it could get lost in a school. It also could get stolen or hidden as a cruel joke. A missing phone would cause problems at home. Parents would be upset with no way to communicate with their kid and a expensive fee for a new phone on top of it. To save this problem cell-phones should be banned at school.

So in summary, cell phones should be banned at school. They are commonly misused, cause problems, and are easily lost. Please take this into consideration as you make your decision.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that cell phones should be completely banned from school grounds for good.

All they do is cause people to not pay attention or possibly even start personal problems that could involve violence.

Cell phones do you no good at school and there is no point in having them.

If you want to talk to your friend walk over to them and have a conversation with them.

If i was the principle I would ban cell phone use and take every phone that I saw no matter who the kid was.

I don't have a phone and I am getting along just fine without one.

I believe that if I can get along without a phone at home my peers can go without there phone for eight hours a day.

Most teenagers may be attached to there cell phones but I think they can do without them.

It may even help them to learn other things instead of which button to click on their cell phone.

The only reason I can think of that cell phones could be used for is to distract students from paying attention during class.

In the long run using your phone in class instead of paying attention could come back and haunt you.

There not going to do any student any good while at school.

There a total waste of time and money.

Teens could be doing other things with their free time at school.

Like: doing homework, reading a book, or even just talking to their friends.

So that is my point of view in the policy of cell phones.

I hope you take this letter into consideration and ban cell phones from the school for good.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

Students should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and free times. They should be allowed as long as they do not use them during class. Some students might need to use them during lunch for certain reasons. They might have to call their parents to bring them something that they might need. There are some real emergencies when we have to use our phone. Sometimes the office or our teachers let us borrow their phones but sometimes the emergency might be personal and the teachers might hear what you are telling your parents. There are times at lunch that you just have to use your phone for any reason.

Another reason why you might need to use your phone during lunch might be because of the food. Maybe you are allergic to something and you are really hungry you can call your parents to bring you something. Another situation might be that we are feeling sick during free time and our teacher doesn't believe us we can call our parents so they can come to pick us up. What would you do if you just feel really sick but you don't want to go home we can call someone to bring us medicine so we can feel better. Or maybe you forgot your homework and your teacher doesn't let you call from the office you can call from your own phone.

There are many reasons why we should be allowed to use our phones at least during lunch or during free time. That's the whole point in having a cell phone if you can't even use it until the afternoon? They should at least let us use it during our free time and during our lunch. We are not doing any harm in using our phones during a period where all you do is eat and have fun. Anyways and sometime the lunch period id so boring you just want to talk to someone else that you hardly see during the day. After all there is some people who do use their phones behind the teachers back because that's the only way you can use it during school hours. if they catch you using your phone all they do is take it way and you get it back. and when they finally say that they aren't going to give it back until the end of the year your parents are going to mad but then their just going to buy you a new phone . That's why principles should just allow us to use them during our free time and our lunch time.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

A recent problem that we have been facing is the school cell phone policy. I know that you are considering two possible policies and I would like to tell you my opinion on which policy is better for the student and the education matter.

Cell phones are a way for students to relax and spend their free time, but cell phones can be a major distraction, especially when it comes to education. I say that we should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

If we do not let the students bring the phones to school at all, they will feel restricted and will alternatively bring their cell phones to school. This will cause more of an absence of mind.

Letting the students use the phones only at free times will teach them trust and respect. Students will no be distracted in class and will have a good time. This way, they concentrate on school work as well as their other interests.

This is my opinion and proposal on the school's cell phone policy. I hope you will consider my idea and thank you for your time.

E4DA68D2918E,"To Principal,

I think that policy one is a better policy, because if as long as we don't have our cell phones out in class then we should be able to have them out during free time and lunch time. But with cell phones not being aloud to be on in school or used makes the students want to have them out in class. So if you were to allow them only in free time or lunch, then i think that students wouldn't have to bring them out in class. They could just have them in free time. But the more the students cant have them out at all then the more there just going to use them in class, when they are supposed to be learning they will be texting on their phones or on the internet instead. That could make them fail whatever grade their in and have to retake it the next year.

If you would allow cell phones, maybe the students will appreciate their learning more and actually want to do assignments and tests instead of having their cell phones out. So if you think about it, it might just be better to allow them then to obey them. I sure would hope that you will rethink this over because i am pretty sure you don't want to have to deal with these students again next year. But its all up to you.

I do really think that it would be way better to allow them because sometimes in class , my friends and i have our cell phones out i mean what student wouldn't? But some students only do it like once or twice like me but other they will just have it out all the time in every class and not pay attention. So that just makes them fail and have to redo everything all over.

Allowing cell phones only in free time and lunch's would possibly change some of the students grades and attitudes. They could use them when their not in class and at lunch. Instead of in class and everywhere else. I am pretty sure that most of the teachers have their phones out so that just gives the ok to students to take out their's.

What i am really trying to say is that you should allow them not obey them. So if you would take a second and reconsider this then it would make all the students plus me HAPPY !

So please just reconsider. Thank you .",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
B2E7CD57F60E,i think policy 1 is the one you should pick because what if something happens to you at school and the principal doesn't let you use your phone during your free time but it would be good too if you dint let them use them during class because then they could get distracted or even cheat at a test lets say you are at lunch and a thief comes up to you and tries to take you with him or her and there's no people around you to help you whose going to help you then if you cant use your phone because your at school but then if your in class and you are doing a test and you have your phone and you happen to not understand a question and your teacher went to the restroom and you use your phone but when you are nearly going to text someone the teacher comes in and sees you and she could take your phone to the principals office and give you a referral or the phone can ring during class and distract others doing work so my honest opinion is policy 1,2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2
FAD0AE0CA89B,"I think policy 2 is better because the principal will not get respect from the kids and the kids will not be doing there work because they will want to have their cell phone out. Policy 2 will keep kids on track and will make sure that kids will not be distracted by their cell phone. Policy 1 is not a good idea because kids will think they will not get in trouble since their allowed to have their cellular device when there at lunch and other free times. Policy 2 will make sure kids do not have their cell phone because they will get it taken away. If the principal chooses the first one, then the kids will think that they will get away with it and mess around during class when they should be working. Kids will not be able to learn and listen if they are allowed to have their cell phone. I think that kids will listen better with policy 2 because no kid wants to get their cell phone taken away by a teacher and they will learn better.

Kids will not learn as good if their constantly on their cell phone during class. kids will be texting each other and playing games. Another reason why it is so bad is that the students could easily text an answer of a question, on like a test or class work and the kids would be cheating. the principle will get in trouble by the parents because their child cheated with another person when they actually didn't learn anything because the thought the could just get an answer from someone that was in the same class and the only way they can do that is if they're allowed to have cell phones in school.

The school will get a bad review by critics because so many kids didn't pay any attention and failed a lot of test and quizzes. Another reason why it is bad to have cell phones at a school is that a lot of kids will ask to go to the restroom and just call people and text them so they can get out of class.

I think children will be better off with out a cell phone in school and they will pay attention more while they are in class. To me, i think policy 2 is better because the kids will be better kids, they will learn more, they will respect their teachers, and the most important of all they will get better grades then ever before.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
2D0AD6FF07F8,"To whom it may concern:

I am within the understanding that you, the principal of the school, have taken the time to ponder over the details of our fine educational establishment's policy regarding cellular devices. I have been informed that you are considering two separate policies: Policy one, which includes the usage of cellular devices at approved times throughout the day, and plan two, which prohibits all usage of devices of said nature. I would like to steer your final decision away from plan two, for reasons soon to come, and in turn bring you to the more reasonable and suitable plan number two.

Currently, our school has restricted any use of electronics, except those with the function of reading, and reading alone, such as the Kindle or the Nook. Cell phones are classified as restricted because of their tendency to divert the students attention from learning to socializing, more so then they currently do. Be that as it may, this is not the case during lunch periods or other free times, as there is no learning happening at these times. Students socialize during lunch and free periods and adding technology to this process would do nothing more than expand the social connection, which has no effects that could prove harmful to students. I, along with the vast majority of the student body find no point in removing phones from free periods, which leads many to believe that doing so is completely pointless. I understand, however, that an educational official of your caliber would not consider making such an impacting decision without a reason. Despite this, I doubt that your reasoning is good. Anytime I or a fellow classmate ask a teacher something along the lines of, ""Why aren't we allowed to use our phones"" (most often when we are caught with it), the answer is always returned, without fail, as, ""Because they are distracting."" The answer suffices, except when you apply it to free periods. Now a new question arises

- distracting from what? Not once have I witnessed a teacher answer this question and it is this lack of reasoning that frustrates students and inclines them to use their phones when they should not be, and it is also this lack of reasoning, that I build my case on. There is nothing wrong with using a cell phone during free periods, and if there is it would be in your best interest to publicize it, less you want to argue your point with no support.

In retrospect, it would be a much wiser decision to endorse plan number one because of the sheer difference in supportive reasoning between the two. Many would prefer the inauguration of a plan with benefits rather than the continuation of a nonsensical plan such as the one currently in use.

With truth and reconciliation,

C43F61E4FFAA,"""RING! RING! RING! RING!"" If you think that sounds annoying, believe me when i say ""I believe policy two would be a great way to keep students focused on their school work"" also rather than trying to hide their cell phones during class. With no cell phones at school, there would be many more less distractions to other student as well. Students should be informed that if the phone call is really that important they should contact whom ever from the school phone, even though many people should know not to bother the students during class. These are a few reasons why i believe that students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school.

Being focused in school is a great way to learn new subjects and useful information. While having your cell phones during school, even if your only able to use it during lunch, will make you lose focus on your work. Cell phones may avoid you from focusing maybe because someone wants your attention or needs answers to a certain subject. Bottom line, cell phones don't help you get your work done in school, so why bother using it if you need to pay attention?

Besides being more focused on what your learning, think about others and how they could be distracted with your use of a cell phone. Cell phones may go off randomly during class disrupting you from reading or disturbing you from solving a math problem. Suppose a student is texting during class, it would be very difficult to try to read while someone besides you constantly keep pushing buttons on to their phone instead of working. If your taking a test also, many people think texting during the test will get them the answers from certain people, and if you have your phone on you, you may be tempted to text or someone may text you for answers, very disturbing.

If a phone call is really important or needed as in emergency's, schools are supplied with phones, so ask permission to use them. You may need to contact maybe a family member or someone important, but do it with the school knowing that your not disrupting any students or policy's. Even if a family member were in need to get in hold with you, their able to contact the school to let them that they need to speak to you.

There are many ways that having cell phones in school could disturb many people, or avoid someone from focusing on school work, or have them think their able to call anyone for what they think are emergency's. To prevent all these disruptions during school you should consider using the second policy. Help students focus more on what they have to do, not what they want to do.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6
C479AE35C5A2,"Dear Principal

Now i know that you are suppose to be overseeing that we obtain a great education. I also know that you think that we should give our full attention to teachers. The only problem is many students complain that their learning gets dry and boring and they need a little bit of excitement in their learning to stay focused. So why not let us use our phones during times when we aren't listening to a teacher! To me i really don't see a big problem with letting us use our phones in hall-ways or on our free periods of time. One good reason i can think of, of letting us have our phones is, what if we just got out of math class and we just learned something new? When we got out of class though we started to lose bits and pieces of the information you just learned, so why not text your friends tips and questions you can use to keep that information in your mind.

Another reason i think we should be aloud to have phones is to loosen our minds if it's tense! Let's say you just got out of one of your classes and had an extremely hard test, and you want to open up your mind a little to let go of some of the stress from that test. Well maybe you need to talk to someone that's on the other half of the school but your next class is on a different half from that person. You can't speak to them physically unless you want to be late, but if you have your cellular device you can communicate with them and that might just help ease your nerves for the next period.

A last reason that i personally think is the most important reason to have a phone at school is for safety/issues. Let's say you have try-outs for a sport and the coach says your ride has to pick you up by a certain time. You forget to let your parents or whoever is picking you up what time they have to be at the school, well if you have your phone you could always call/text that person and your situation may be resolved. Now let's say your at school and a intruder invades the school and the school resource officer is no where to be found! What do you do? Here's a suggestion, ""call"" someone to help, You never know what could happen to you so why take the chance of not having a method of communication to help you out? I hope that you take these words into consideration and hopefully allow us to have our phones out during our free time.      ",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8

I believe policy 1 is the best one because it allows us to talk with our friends and socialize more. We will not have our phones during class time because you gave us the privilege to have our phones at certain times. If a gunman had came into out school, the 911 call responder will defiantly get a call about an gunman in the school. Also have our phone in school ours is good because we can boost are socialism up and be more confident in our selves.

By having our phones in school a gunmen will surly not hurt as many people because the report of him in the school will surly be high and lots of policeman would come and bring him to custody. This will save lots of injury's that probably would of happen.

Having our cell phones in school will bring our socialism up because we could talk to people more and for victims of being bullied would be stop because you can be more social, that could be a nice avoid.

Now your life style would be great and now you have more friends and what could you want possibly more.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
8EFE0973A57A,"I think policy 1 is better because cell phones are used for different things and sometimes when you really need to call someone then that's what you have a cell phone for. Cell phones are also in use just incase of an emergency. For example; if you had an accident and you need to call your parents but your teacher wont let you leave the classroom then you can just tell him/her that you need the classroom to be silent so that way you can call your parents and let them know that you need a pair of pants or something to change into because you had an accident or you can have a cell phone on you for a reason like saying that you have to go to a doctors appointment and your parents don't want to write you a note so they text the note to you so that you can show it to your teacher and so that he/she will know what's going on at school.

Also, phones can be used at school for reasons like, maybe your in the middle of texting someone at home and your not finished so you need to finish texting them. Well some people bring there phones to school for that specific reason. Or maybe just to check the time on there phones because you cant read the clock. Although, some people don't need there phones because they probably be on some website on there phone like misplace or even face book but if that was the case then the parents just not buy internet for them at all.

Sometimes they might not need a phone because they can misplace there phone easily but there parents don't care and think that its okay and just buy them a new one but what i would do is if my child lost his/her phone then i wouldn't buy or even attempt to get them a new one for a while, only because phones these days are so expensive now.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
B19C6EA1C4B7,"Dear Principal,

I believe you should use policy one because, many students do not have things to do during free time. Most students are pretty good at following the rules with phones. Some students have their phones on them all day because they do not trust the lockers are a safe place for their expensive materials, but they are off. It is not fair to have to keep something so valuable in your locker. Things are being stolen. You say the only thing to keep that from happening is to not tell other people your locker combination or to keep your lock on your locker. You only give us students three minutes to get from one class on the upper floor down to our lockers, unlock them, grab our stuff then go back upstairs to our next class. Or, you give us the three minutes to get from a downstairs class to our upstairs lockers just to walk to the other side of the building! It really does seem unreasonable. That is why most people keep the lock off their lockers. They have more time to use to get to their classes. With an unlocked locker I do not think I would leave my cell phone in there.

Cell phones are a hard policy to debate on because you can not just say everyone has one and everyone keeps it on all day. Many people use their phones. It is very unfair that they do not get caught, but that is just something you have to live with. One day cell phones will not be a problem for adults. Just about everyone will have one. If cell phones were such a problem people would not have them. Yes, it is another bill to pay but not everyone has to pay for their phones. Some students are home-schooled and just get our early. Us children in the schools can not help that.

I do not think you should take phones away because some people need their phones to get a hold of parents. It is not easy to get a ride home when you do not have your phone. Maybe teachers should just watch more carefully for phones. It is a school rule not to have your phone on you so if they suspect that you have it then they should be able to ask for it. Many times students take their phones out in class and use them a teacher would never know if they are not in the class. Not very many people are going to tell that you have your phone on you, and not many are going to say you are using it. Many children carry gum around with them. They make phones that small now. I do not think that some of the teachers understand that. It is quite easy to hind a phone. Many people use sweat shirts, others use their shoes. Some, even just make it look like gum! So if you think about it, many students do break the phone rule. They do not like to they just like using their phones all the time. Some people just have to talk to other people all the time. So, it is just like if you do not see them then your just simply text them when they are not busy.

Many of us do not care when we are busy. I still think you should be favor students keeping their phones. If they are out in free times we are not really hurting anything. But, if you take them and say we can not have them at school then many people will not be able to contact parents. I believe all of the students would plead the same story. So please let us keep our phones.

I hear that you are reconsidering our schools cell phone policy. If that is true, I am going to give you my opinion on which I think you should choose. I'm a student at your school.

Between the two different policies that I have heard, I think policy 1 sounds the best. Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. This would be better for students. It would help relieve stress, give us something to do between classes, and less students would get in trouble over having there phones out.

Having your cell phone could help relieve a lot of stress. Okay, for instance you have a big test coming up that you haven't studied for, and you are really torn up about it. You could text or call a friend/family member to talk you threw the situation at hand. How many of you have had a ton of homework, and you just need some time to relax? I know I have. Talking to someone would help you threw that. But our phones do not need to be on at all during instructional time.

We have at least an hour of free time a day. We have 30 minutes at lunch, 5 minutes between each of our 7 classes, and a 15 minute brake. That comes out to actually be an hour and 20 minutes. During this time there are fights and all kinds of drama. On the other hand being aloud to have our phones out, that could take our mind off of all that drama and stupid stuff. I think sometimes everyone needs a break to do what they need to do.

I know that all 3 of our principals have a lot to do during the day. Writing people up for the most simple things ; such as having a phone out seems crazy to me. There are more problems and tasks' at hand. Less students would get in trouble for having there phones if you would just make it okay to have them. I don't think that there would be half as many cell phone issues as there is today, if this policy went in effect.

I hope that you take the stuff I have said into consideration. Having cell phones out at school isn't bad, as long as we abide by the rules. Having them out during instructional time would be strictly prohibited. Students that did not follow this rule, shall have there cell phone privileges at school taken away. I do believe this would make a drastic impact on our school. As long as the students were using this cell phone time responsibly, then everything would be going smoothly. Just please, give us the opportunity to show you, we can do it.

If They need to call there parents for something I think they should be allowed to do that. Students should be allowed to use there phones at lunch periods and at other free times. Some people might think it should not be allowed because phones are a distraction. On the other hand the phones are turned off so they cant get any calls or text. If the school is closing early because of a tornado, or hurricane, or earthquake. Students should be able to call there parents so they can come and pick them up from school if its during lunch or at free times. Students should not get their phones out during class and disrupt class. Students are getting lucky to bring their phones to school. You should not be allowed to have your phone in study hall if you have homework or need to study for a test because it will distract you. So that's why I think policy one is the best just because there might be a emergency.

BFF79DCB9336,"Our school principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. Many students are for and against this decision. Cell phones should not be allowed in school. There are many reasons to support my decision. Some reasons are that they are a distraction, can be used for cheating, and can be used to do dangerous or inappropriate things.

First and foremost cell phones are a complete distraction. Using cell phones in school will only make students not pay attention to their teachers. While their teacher is teaching they will be texting and ignoring the lesson. Students will be clue less on class work because they didn't pay attention to the lesson because of their phones. Students will end up failing their classes.

In addition these devices can be used as a source of cheating. While students are taking tests they can easily take out their phones and start texting each other answers. For example, one of my old friends was caught cheating on her test. Since her school allowed phones they thought it would be acceptable to text each other answers. As a result my friend ended up getting a zero on her important test and had to repeat the year. She now also had a record of being a cheater.

Lastly, phones can be used to do inappropriate things. Some students might even use their phones to cyber bully someone. Bullying someone can get you in a load of trouble. It can also cause many problems to the person being bullied. For instance sometimes they might even get mentally or physically hurt. They might even want to put an end to their own life. According to ""Time Magazine"" 75% of students in the U.S are being bullied to death.

In conclusion cell phones should definitely not be allowed on school grounds. They will just be a huge distraction to everybody. Cell phones can even be used for hurting some one and cheating on tests. These devices would just be unnecessary for school.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I think students should be allowed to have their cell phones in school for many different reasons.

There's many reasons for students to NOT bring their cell phone to school. They might lose it, it can disrupt class, it can distract students from their work, and many more reasons. But there's also reasons you should bring it to school.

To start off, let's say you did a HUGE project for English. Like a ten page essay. You did all of your homework, no problem. But then you get to school and you realize that you left it on the counter! How bad would that be? Well no problem, if you have English first, your teacher might be nice and she'll let you turn it in sometime during the day. Or if you have it last, make sure you somehow get it to school before class. So what do you do? The easiest thing to do is call or text your mom or dad asking them to bring in that project. Since it is the biggest project of the year, they will probably agree and drop it off at school. The best thing to do though is to make sure you have your stuff for school BEFORE you leave. That's what people will mainly do if they have their phone in school.

For another example, let's say your football practice was cancelled. Instead of standing outside for an hour or two waiting for your mom to pick you up, you can take out your cell phone and call your mom telling her practice was cancelled. She could then come and pick you up. That's another big thing cell phones are used for in school.

One of the less common ones that happen during school is emergencies. Let's say there's a bomb threat. They have no idea where the bomb is, or where it could possibly be, so they move all the students and teachers to another building, or they wait outside. That would be a bad situation if you weren't allowed to have your cell phone. You could easily call or text your mom asking to come pick you up (if the school allows it, that is) and that conflict would be resolved while you're not there, and not in danger. The only reason that would be a problem is that when the police are on their way to investigate, they would have a hard time getting into the school while the parents are on their way to go pick up their kid.

Those are the main reasons that students should have their cell phones at school. They should have it on them at all times, but have it off or silenced for most of the time. The only times they should really use it for non-school or emergency related purposes is during lunch or when the teachers allow you to use it.

So all in all, I'd go with Policy 1.

Sincerely,

Cell phones are an important thing in students lives, and are an important part in their lives.

In school some students need to get a hold of their parents for something important.

Students should be allowed to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch and passing time, but be off before class starts.

In school many times I have needed to get a hold of my mom or dad to tell them that basketball practice has been canceled or I don't need them to sign me up for something I can sign it up at school. If I was able to use my phone during passing time or at lunch it would be a lot easier for my parents and I to communicate and it would cause less confusion for my family.

I know of many students that need to get a hold of their family or someone but they cannot because we cannot use cell phones and the office will not allow a student to use the office phone.

My cousin goes to Novi high school and they are allow to use their cell phones at points during the school day and it has never caused any problems.

Students should be allowed to use their cell phones during passing time and in lunch.

If student were allowed to do this it would make all family's lives a lot easier.

If the parent knows that the student needs to be picked up from school it will allow the student to get home from school earlier making it easier to do their homework right, and with high quality.

I believe that you should choose Policy One because cell phones can be an important source of information. I also nurture a belief that they should not be used during class times because class times are for learning and understanding what is being taught.

It would allow time for students to get things that are on their minds out of the way so that they could focus more on learning during class times.

I look upon it as students would not be as tempted to text during classes. I hold an opinion that it would help students to center their thoughts more completely with less things that do not relate to class work on their minds.

Allowing cell phones to be used during lunch and other free times could possibly encourage students not to use cell phones during class and to wait until free time is available to use them. I do not feel that cell phones would be as big of a distraction if they were allowed during lunch and free times.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

I think that you should let the students bring their cell phones to school and let them use them during lunch and other free time. And then if they don't turn them off during class or if they get caught texting or playing games with their phones they should get them taken away. If they get there phones taken away they should get them after class. If they get it taken away again they should have to get them after school. Then if they get taken a third time their parents should have to come and get them.

I think if you let them bring their phones to school they would be much happier. Because if you don't they would probably find something more loud and annoying to do. I believe that if do this it would save allot of frustration and complaints from students and teachers.

I think that most students would be reasonable enofe to agree with these terms. Because it is better to have them for some of the time then none of the time. I also think the parents would like this because then they don't have to be down at the school talking with the principal and getting their son or daughters phone all the time.

5A91C6A1224E,"I think policy 2 is better because many student would just brake the rule of keeping your phone turned off during class, so if their going to brake the rule might as well not let them use it during school. These days student are just always on their phone and they aren't trying hard enough in school, either because they are distracted to much, or they are just spending their time on their phone chatting with their friends. The principle should banned student from using phones during school is in session until the principle sees the students test scores are getting higher up. Not allowing student to use their phone during school is a great idea because now students are going to be more focused on school studies then just spending their time on their phone. Phones are a great invention but I think it would be better to keep them out of schools for the students education. Most parent's of students would probably agree with me. I consider phones distractions inside of a school campus. If I were to go to school and offer a student a phone, or an education the student would most likely choose the phone. My opinion is that the most important thing a student should get is a education, but if they cant get it because a phone is more important to them then i think that is just sad.

I have heard that you are considering to let students have cell phones in our school.

I have written this letter to try and convince you not to.

If students are able to text, chat, call, and play with their phones and with other people, no one would learn anything anymore.

Nearly all the students would be immersed in their cell phones, and with the cell phones available, people could search the web, go online, play games, listen to music, practically everything, right there on their cell phone.

I assure you that if you let people have their cell phones, average grades would be lower than if they didn't, as not everyone one would be paying attention to the teacher's lecture, power-point, video, etc., but instead they would be secretly texting each other and searching the web or playing games.

It is very easy to hide a cell phone while using it.

It could be in a book, or under a desk.

And yet, these are not the only issues.

Some of the students here don't have as much financially as other students.

The cell phones will arouse jealousy and lead to stealing.

If you have this rule in place, you can potentially be accounted responsible for lost or stolen phones.

If you are seriously considering this, don't let students have their cell phones at all.

They would not need to pay attention in class or learn anything, instead, they would just need some WiFi to look it up on their phone.

Don't allow students to have their cell phoned on and in use every day.

If you truly care about your students education at this school, you will listen to this, and ban all cell phone use.

So what shall it be. Do you care about your students, or not?

I am writing to you about the cell phone policies you are considering. I think that most of the students here would like to see you allow us the have our phones out during lunch and other free times as long as there turned off during class time. I think i speak for everyone when i say this. I also think if this went into effect soon it would make kids realize that you shouldn't text during class that they should wait until lunch or after school.

Not allowing students to use their phone will make them use it during class instead of waiting till lunch because they know that they don't have the time to use them anyway. However, if students know they have time to use their phones during school at certain times it may make kids stop during class times. I also think that if kids use their phones a lot during school and the kid they are talking to gets their phone taken away it could make that kid stop texting along with others since they could use it more often.

In conclusion I think that you should really consider choosing policy number one. This would make a lot of students excited to know that they have some time to use their phones during school. This could be a good thing for the school and the kids that go here.

I know you are stuck between two policies and you don't know which one to choose. I think that ""Policy 1"" , is the one you should choose. I think that because all us students have cell phones and use them and take them everywhere we go. So, yes we bring them to school. I think that policy would do good because during class we cant use them, so say kids used there phones during class, that means they could be cheating on tests or getting homework answers from there friends. This policy says that we have to have them turned off during class which i agree with because that means people cant be cheating or getting answers to anything anymore.

I also think its a good idea because use them during free time could be great for us students because during that free time we could text our parents and let them know if they need to pick us up after school or we are riding the bus home. Also we could tell them if we have after school activities and they don't need to pick us up after them are over. Which this would be so much easier for parents because we aren't telling them at the last minute that we need picked up after school because we missed the bus or we just need picked up because we are reminding them that we do so they don't forget all about it.

Also, if parents have work they don't want to wait till the last minute to know you have after school activities so if they are working late then they can call someone else and tell them to pick you up and instead of having the parents stressed out and all upset and yelling at you because you didn't tell them this sooner.

That makes it easier for parents and students then. Also, if students forget what pages there homework was or what time is practice after school they can text one of their friends and ask them. If we had the other policy, then how could we figure out if we had homework or not ,and that we forgot about it. Or that there is a test that we need to study for, that you forgot about. Than you wouldn't know and get a zero on your homework and a bad grade on your test, which isn't good. That also means we would get a bad grade in that class and that means we can't play sports or be in after school activities. Then our parents would be all mad at us and they would be stressed out even more.

Also, if we are in sports and we have practice after school and we totally forget, than we could text one our friends that is on the same team as you and ask them ""Hey do we have practice after school?"" and they reply ""Yes, we do at 3:00 till 5:00."". Then we would know and wouldn't get in trouble the next day by the coach for missing practice.

This would make parents and students less stressful and upset. That's why i think we should have cell phones in school during free time and lunch periods instead of having them at all.

I do not think you should allow cell-phones at school due to the fact that the students may use them in class, use them in free periods instead of doing necessary things, and it helps create more drama and bullying come to our school.

If cell-phones are allowed at school, the students would most definitely use them in class. Having them around school would tempt them to bring them into class. The children would text each other so they don't have to listen in class, and not learn. Or even worse, cheat on tests using their phones that are allowed in school. That could end in a worse situation that no one wants to happen. Everyone says they will get caught, but the reality is they won't, and if they do it may be too late.

In free periods the smart thing to do is to get work off of the students hands, and do things that they need to. But if they have a cell-phone near it may detracted them from doing anything needed. If students can't get some work done before school ends they would have a lot to do at home, which may result in a bad night sleep.

As a result of bad sleep, the children are not able and open to learning as much. All of that is caused by a simple cell-phone during a free period.

When cell-phones are around, news spreads fast. Phones are being used for bullying a lot these days and if something bad happens, it stirs up and even worse situation.

Bullying can affect school work and how someone thinks of school in general. Also, bullying can just plain make the person upset and scared. In a school you don't want that kind of environment. Having phones around makes it easier for people to communicate to each other and tell what ever anyone wants. Bullying is something we all need to try and stop, not make bigger.

To conclude, i think have cell-phones at school is a bad idea because students wouldn't be able to get their work done and it would make a bigger case of bullying. Most importantly, the students may use their phones in class. Although it makes sense that you would think if kids get to use it at all they would know the boundaries, but in reality they don't.

Cell-phones would be a bad idea to allow in school.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I go with policy one because we can use them though free time because what will happen if somebody trying to kidnap us we cant call no one because we didn't bring our phones to school. Another reason is what will happen if our parents is looking for us after school they cant find us cause you told us not to bring our cell phone it mate be a emergency and we cant call our parent because we don't have our cell phone. But the principal is right we cant use it in the class room because what happen if the teacher is teaching and the phone just ring your will disturb everybody in the classroom. then whoever found rung will get in trouble, and if you texting why the teacher trying to help you and he give you a text you want know what to do you will get bewilder you want know what to do or how to do it.",2,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.2

In addition, it depends on the student if they want to take advantage of their education or not. They are the ones who choose their future. So if their phone is a distraction for them for their education, then they should do something about it. During lunch periods, its all about free time from school, so they should use their phones. Also, if you put Policy 2, students would have to use them in case of an emergency. Furthermore, if you put Policy 1, then the students won't have to ""want"" to take their phones out during class because they can take their phones out during lunch periods and other free times.

I think you should go with Policy 1 because some kids text in school no matter what and most never get caught. I think kids will do better in school if they can text and use their phones at lunch and free time.

Kids want to talk to their friends during the day, friends that they don't see until lunch or even the end of the day. If teachers would remind them to turn their cell phones off during class so they would pay more attention to what they are teaching, they might do better in class. If students had a test the teacher could take all the cell phones and put them in a bucket or a box, and the students could have them after everyone was done with the test so they wouldn't cheat.

Students wouldn't get into so much trouble if they could just use their cell phones, because most of the time that is why they get in trouble is for having them out. So that is why I think you should go with Policy 1.

I think that policy 1 is better because when you have free time what will you do? If you tell students to read when they have free time that's not really free time because they're still working. I will give you some reasons why i think that policy 1 is better then policy 2.

One reason why policy 1 is better is because if you tell students to read a book when they have free time they won't want to do it because they've been working all day. So if students don't want to do something they're not going to do it. Most of the time when you tell students to do something they don't want to do they start disrupting class and getting in trouble.

Another reason is because students do it without permission anyway. So giving them the right to have their phone out during free time will help a lot of people stay out of trouble. This would be a good policy to make because almost everyday people get their phone taken away for pulling it out during class.

If you make policy 2 a rule it won't make a difference because students are still going to do it anyway. So you would be way better off with making policy 1 a rule. Policy 1 would stop a lot of people from getting their phone taken.

The last reason i can think of is students might actually do their work so they can have their phone out. I believe that will pull up a lot of students grades. I hope you decide to choose this policy because i think it would really help students bring up their grade and stay out of trouble.

Students usually take out the phone in class and start texting. I don't think students should even have cell phones at all especially in school grounds. Students take out there phone in class and start texting while their teacher is giving the lesson. This makes students miss what they had to learn for the day. Along come test days and they didn't study, didn't rest, didn't pay attention and all for what? To text there friends.

What usually occurs is that they just text some other friend to ask them the answers to the test. These type of students are failing classes just to text their friends or even their boyfriends. They have not yet realized the importance of education. I used to have a phone myself and i got caught texting in class, and i noticed that my grades started to go down. One day i also got caught having inappropriate pictures on my phone and so i got fined for that. When i had a phone those were the worst days of my life.

Now i don't have a phone and my grades are great, I'm doing fine on tests and i don't get into trouble as much as i used to.

I think policy number one is the best of the two. I do not like policy number two because it is way to strict. If we had that I think it would be a lot less fair.

If we had policy two it would not bother anyone. Everyone would be very happy with that decision. The phones would really not bother people at a lunch period and also at free time when they can do whatever they want.

On the other hand a phone could go off in class and disturb everyone that is trying to there hardest. Also it could get them in a lot of trouble for bringing there cell phone out. It could also harm them and there education and they will not learn that much.

I think that cell phones should not be allowed in schools. It is just a disturbance to everyone that is doing there school work. All the kids that disturb the class with there cell phones should get a detention. Students should be able to carry them but, they have to be shut off or in there locker. That would be just fine I think and when they get out of school they can do whatever they want on there phones.

I want everyone to go to your principal and see what you can do about your cell phone policy. You never know you could change the schools mind and be able to use cell phones at lunch periods. Maybe you could get a more strict rules if you are getting disturbed by peoples cell phones everyday. Again I do believe that cell phones should be allowed in school and used at lunch periods.

I agree with the first policy. I agree because i think that it is a fair deal that students can bring their cell phones but they have to turn them off during classes. It is fair because teachers wont get mad and complain about us using our cell phones in classes. I understand that it can cause a big problem on our free time but where i come from in my mind is that what if something happen to us or to the school. Teachers cant watch all of the children they don't know what will happen. All the teachers cant let all the children use their phone if its an emergency because i would believe that its over 200 students in the school that we are in. That is why i think we should be allowed to have phones and if we have free time you will think you can never get our attention if we are on our phones well i agree but its always not true. I think you will figure something out if you speak loud enough in the microphone, you will have everybody's attention.

With the first policy if you allow students to have cell phones at all in school they will use them when they can get away with it. They will text message in class behind teachers backs, in the library, in the restrooms anywhere they can. If cell phones were a problem before do not allow kids to have them during school.

Many kids will not break this rule but some kids if they need a way to contact there parents will not have one if you go with policy two. Or if they need a ride home. I need my phone right after school to see when my dad is picking me up, if we had car troubles, when someone is picking me up and more. I think if a student is caught with a cell phone they should have a sort of punishment of keeping the phone for the rest of the school day but not days at a time.

My dad believes that texting was invented to talk to someone when your not supposed to. I agree that texting is a secretive way to talk. There are new cell phones everyday that are know smaller and it makes them easier to carry it around with out people realizing that they have it. There are faster ways to text to so it would give students more time to text and more time to get away with it.

It is better than not bringing it at all because even when they're not suppose to bring it they still do and get caught. Teens now just like texting and using their cell phone. Cell phone are needed because of an emergency , forgot something, or of other reasons. During free times, students get bored and want to use their cell phone for entertainment. Not bringing their cell phone get people in some trouble because they still bring it. Bringing their phones won't get many students in trouble because they're allow to have it and the population of breaking the rule will be less and less.

Do you have a cell phone? It is nice to have, isn't it? You can do so many things with your cell phone like getting on the internet, getting in touch with friends, or keeping track of stuff. Well all these things could help during school. I'm not saying you should let us have it out during class, but in between class periods or during lunch. It would be a big help to us and you. By that I mean our education.

If you allowed us to take our phones out in between classes, we cold swiftly study for a quiz or exam we had in an upcoming period. This would help you in our school test score rating overall.

When we are in school for so long, we students tend to get bored and so we start talking then the teacher gets mad because we are to loud or we are talking while he/she is talking. A way to prevent that is to let us have our phones out during lunch so we can talk to our friends. You might say we get to talk to our friends all the time. I'm talking about the people we don't sit with at lunch cause ya'll don't let us sit any where we want. So we could text or talk to the people across the lunch room.

In our phones we have note pads, calendars, calculators, and other stuff we could use for school. we could keep up with notes taken in class or set an alarm for a day we have test.

I cant say we would not take advantage of this priviledge cause some people will.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
4B64E914C68B,"Dear Principal;

I think Policy 1 is the better one out of the two because communication in school is important.

Telling people about relationships is always a big deal in school. So instead of the class being the place for talk, why not free time or lunch. It would cut the chatter during class and would let teachers get out the information to the whole class without any distractions.

Since lots of people have the same classes they can tell their friends what is happening in that class, so they can be ready for it. Also to tell them about projects or tests that are happening in that class.

Sports are another big thing that require communication. Not just to fellow teammates but to parents as well. Say if a practice is cancelled or a game gets moved up a day early how will you be able to contact your parents. Emails may not get read until the next day, and if all the team calls on the office or nurse's phone then that will interrupt class time. Instead of all that chaos they can just call their parents on their phones or send them a text.

So if you haven't been able to figure it out yet, Policy 1 is a much better choice than Policy 2. Also the students will be happier with the principal for allowing them to use their phones at all.

Cell phones are glorious pieces of technology, they are sometimes seen as an attention hog to kids and teenagers, but at other times a life-saving device. I believe that you should let kids have phones at school and use them only during lunch and free times. You should do this because it can help kids grades go up, it can help in emergencies, and it can entertain the kids themselves more.

First off, kids are always forgetting things. The most forgotten thing for kids is their homework. Because of this habit of lack of remembering, kids grades usually go down just because they forgot their homework. Well with cell phones their grades could go back up. If a kid ever forgot his/her homework at home, they could just call their parents or their brother or sister to come bring it to them at school. Cell phones would have saves the day again!

Second, emergencies tend to happen sometimes. They can be big emergencies like a fire, lockdown, etc. Or they can be small emergencies like forgetting your lunch at home. With cell phones, emergencies could be solved better! If a kid forgot their lunch they could call home and have someone get it for them. If a fire started in the school someone with a cell phone could call 911 and have immediate response. Without cell phones kids would be hungry and we would have to wait for a teacher to call the fire department to get it put out. That would be disastrous. Just another reason kids should have their cell phones.

Last, Kids always need to be entertained. Entertainment is a part of childhood and sometimes its not exactly found at lunch. If kids could use their cell phones at lunch they could have fun texting their friend who lives in another state, or calling their friend to see why he/she isn't at school today. See, this also provides entertainment!

Cell phones are today's revolution, and they can be bad at sometimes, but very good at others. that is why this school should have cell phones available to them so they can stop forgetting homework, get emergencies handled, and have something fun to do at lunch",5,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.8
E8312870BC60,"CELL PHONES AT SCHOOL?

Phones should be allowed to be at school because kids need to be able to talk to there friends, emergency, and to call home for needs.

First reason is kids need to talk to there friends. They can talk to there friends in the hall but they cant see them all the time. They need to be able to have a social life to. When your at lunch you sit next to all your friends, and talk to them so you can use your phone, and talk to them or text them. That is my first reason why should be allowed to have phones in school.

Second reason is we should be able to call in case of an emergency. What if you get really bad hurt and you need to tell your mom or dad to come pick you up. you can go to the nurse but then some people will pick on you and call you a wimp. Sometimes you need to call home if you not feeling so good because that can end up getting other kids sick to. That is my second reason why we should be able to have cell phones in school.

Last reason is to call home for needs. You sometimes need to call home and ask for some things you left at home. Some people play soccer or football and might have forgot there shoes (cleats) at home. Also the thing in school now for lunch is that you have to bring lunch money to school. You might have left it at home and now you cant eat. That's my last reason why we should be aloud to have cell phones at school.

I believe that the policy for cell phones in the schools should be for students to be allowed to bring phones to school and to be allowed to use them in lunch periods and other free times. I believe this because in our society today, easier communication has become a necessity, and I cannot see any apparent reason on why phones should have forbidden use in times of the day were students are allowed to talk and enjoy themselves. School is a place for learning, but in free times of the day students should be allowed to listen to music, cell phones, etc.. Allowing students to have cell phones in free periods and lunch would give the student body a higher respect for the staff and faculty of the school for giving them the privilege to have there cell phones with them in free times, and I believe that this would result in more courtesy and respect in the student body towards staff, faculty, and each other. I do not disagree with students to have forbidden use of there cell phones during class because it would get in the way of a student's education, and this could result in bigger problems later on in there lives. the student body on it's part should not have a disregard for cell phone use in class, and should respect and honor the privilege given to them. If cell phone use is given to students in free times of the day, I believe the student body can uphold its part, and this would definitely result in a better community in the school. Thank you.

0ABE27218D9C,"To our principal:

I think that cell phones during school should be aloud but only during free periods. So i support policy 1.

This policy is considerable and is much more fair to students then policy 2 because you would at least allow students to bring in cell phones and use them during appropriate times in the day regardless to just cutting them off completely. So as a student i think we should be remotely thankful for the 1st policy to even be an option because of the way we tortured our privileges using them in school.

If you didn't bring this out to the public and made the decision on your own to just stick with policy 2 then there would be some problems with the students because this similar situation happened at SCHOOL_NAME and the students there ended up protesting because they wanted a say in what they should be able to do. So i like the way you are being fair and letting us tell you how we think it should be.

Policy 1 is the better selection anyway because this way you keep your students happier and i don't see a problem on letting kids use there cell phones during free periods/lunch periods because these wont completely distract them during a period like this.

If you ended up choosing policy 2 don't think students would kick back and just listen to that rule. I guarantee students would end up still bringing there cell phones to school and using them when their not supposed to. If they where aloud like in policy 1 then students wouldn't try as much to sneak them in because they know that they'll be able to use/check them at some point in the day.

So don't make it hard on us and just choose option 1 because i promise you things will be better off that way.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
554117C603DC,"TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should choose the first policy because students wouldn't really like the second. If you banned cell phones from school most students would bring them anyways. There would also be the issue with texting in class. And last but not least some parents need their children to have their cell phones with them when they are not at the house.

The reason that students would bring their cell phones to school if you banned them, would be just the simple fact that they are banned. Teenagers have an irrational desire to disobey rules. Banning cell phones would only encourage their defiance and give them that much more reason to bring their cell phones to school.

So not only would there be cell phones at school but students would text in class. This would be like adding insult to the injury. Now if we were allowed to use our cell phones in free time there would be no need to text in class. Meaning we would pay more attention to the teacher than to our phones.

Last some students have responsibilities that require that they have their phone with them. For example my bus drops me off in front of my little sister's elementary school. Everyday I call my mom to tell her I got my sister and that we're on our way home. I'm sure I'm not the only student that does this. So if i left my phone at home there would be the problem of my parents worrying weather or not i picked up my little sister and if we where already walking home.

So I ask that you consider my reasons of why you should chose the first policy and let us use our cell phones at school. Instead of banning them like the second policy would have you do.

62884F478162,"I think that students should be able to have cell phones during school but should be turned off during classes. The only times the students will be allowed to have there cell phones out is during the morning, lunch, and during any breaks that they have.

Having cell phones out during classes is a distraction towards the student because if the teacher is giving a lesson that is really important and they students are not listening, then the student is out of luck if the notes that they were supposed to take were on a test. If the students have there phones out during math class, they could be cheating on a test or an assignment that the teacher has given them.

Students should only be able to use there cell phones if they don't feel good or if they are in trouble. They should only be able to call there parents for those reasons only or if they forgot something at there house. But if they are using that cell phone to text there friends because they are bored, then that cell phone should be taken away by a teacher or the principal.

The students are not getting the education they need if they are on there cell phone throughout all of there classes or for the entire school year. If the students are not paying attention to there teacher and there teacher says to put the cell phone away and they don't listen, them that's when the teacher should taken there cell phone away from them. There is no need for them to be on that cell phone when they are in class. Some students are failing classes because they are not paying attention to the lesson the teacher is trying to tell the students.

The students are not going to pay attention if the teacher does not do anything about the cell phone problems. The students will just keep ignoring them and ignoring them. That is no way for a teacher to be treated by a student. So, they can have there cell phones nut not during classes.

6BCD21E497A5,"Dear Principle,

I have heard about how you are deciding on banning cell phones, or allowing them at school. I hope you will consider to allow them at school during free time, such as before and after school. We students have many important uses for cell phones, such as calling our parents, calling friends incase of a problem at school, or to dial nine-one-one when needed.

If there was a problem where we needed to be picked up because it is raining and we do not have an umbrella, we would not be able to if we did not have our cell phones. Another example would be if a friend or classmate needed a ride home. And when parents pick up their children, their is always a long line at the front of the school, so they call them to let them know they will be parked by the curb two blocks down the street.

Another reason is if they need to call their friends for homework, such as when a science project is due. They can also call them to let them know that they left a belonging at their house, or if they have a question only their friend can answer. If they had a argument in school, and want to talk about it, wouldn't they want to call their friends? Well they would need their cell phone in order to do that.

Let us say that a female student was walking home, when she happened to encounter a bully is abusing a child younger then him. She would not be able to do anything but tell an adult right away. But let us say it happened in a alley next to an abandoned store. The only choices for her would be to interfere, or call nine-one-one. The latter is a much better idea, considering that it is a lot safer, and she would not get hurt.

I hope I have convinced you of why cell phones should be allowed in school. It helps students keep in touch with parents and is a great backup in an emergency! If there was a problem where the students were to use their cell phones in class, it can be solved by telling the teachers to confiscate them until the end of the day.

I believe that you should us the first policy that you are considering. Most students need their cell phones for emergencies, or any other time they need to talk to someone important or make a change of plans. If students were not allowed to have cell phones at school, they would not have any contact with their parents. The only reason most kids have a cell phone is so their parent can have contact with them and know that they are safe.

One reason kids should be allowed to have cell phones at school, is because there might be an emergency. For example, if a kid who relies on the bus to take them home does not have his cell phone on him, and the bus breaks down, he does not have the option to call his parents to come and pick him up. this can cause the parents to worry when their child does not come home on time, and they cannot contact him on his cell phone. parents do not like to worry about their kids, and you might get calls from these worried parents, asking about their child. that would be a big inconvenience for you.

Another reason is that a kid might have after school plans. if those plans got canceled, the child cannot call their parents and tell them what happened, while the parents assume that their son or daughter is at a friends house. the child will have to walk home, which sometimes can take more than an hour depending on where the kid lives. It is important for parents to know where there child is at all times, and that is why if their plans got canceled, they do not have that knowledge.

That is why I strongly believe you should consider your first policy over the second.

Kids need to have contact with their parents, and choosing your second policy would be a bad idea. Parents want to know wher their child is and what they are doing.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

The second reason why you should let kids use their phones is that they wont use them in class. If they can use phones at lunch they wont get in trouble for using them in class. The parents wont hate if their kids don't get in trouble.

7294BD879F8B,"Many students enjoy their cell phones in or out of school. I believe that the principal should consider policy one. My first reason i think we should use policy one is because some students may need their cell phones during school hours. The students might need to call their mom or dad to tell them that they do not have practice today. This does happen and if it does, you will need your cell phone to call your parent to arrange after school rides.

My second reason for choosing policy one is that what if a student has an emergency or needs help during school. You cannot always rely on your teacher or an adult to help you with that situation. Another student in your classroom could be bullying you so much that you just cannot take it anymore. Someone could have put gum in your chair where you have it stuck on to your pants now. It would be indeed useful and convenient to have the privilege to use your cell phone during your lunch or free time.

My third reason for believing in the first policy is that what if your mom or dad is sick at home and might need help. Your parent made you go to school telling you that they would be fine, but you worry about them all day while your at school. It would be a good thing if you could call your parent during lunch to check on them to see how they are doing. With the first policy, you could also use your cell phone on your free time. An accident could happen when you are on the playground and you before one can say 'Jack Robinson', you fall in a mud puddle. You will then need your cell phone to call your parent for a change of clothes.

I also believe in the first policy because you should not be allowed to have your cell phones on during class time. I have known some schools who do allow the usage of cell phones while in class, and they do not seem to learn as well as others. Those students seem to get distracted while trying to learn. Having cell phones allowed during class could stress the teacher out because she sees that her students are not listening but instead are too busy on their cell phones texting. It is important for the students to learn what they need to learn without having the distractions of cell phones.

I think it would be silly not to allow cell phones during your lunch or your free time. First, because why not? Second, if they are not in class the cell phones would not be a problem. I surmise that the students of your school will certainly feel pleasure in policy one where the cell phones are allowed, just not during class while your are desperate to learn.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

Allowing students to use cell phones at school is alright as long as you don't use them in class. The reason why I say this is because when you are in class the teacher is teaching and if you start using it, it's disrespectful. Also, you'll get caught and your phone will be taken away. When you start having free time or lunch period, then its alright for you to use your phone because nobody is teaching you. My opinion is that its better off if we can use our phones while having lunch or break time, so nobody can tell you to put your phone away or take it away from you because its our time to do whatever we want to do.

Using phones in class is really disrespectful and you'll never learn anything in class. If you are in a middle of a class, your teacher is teaching and suddenly you have a phone call or text. you shouldn't pick it up. Ignore the phone and stay with what the teacher is teaching you about. Also, you shouldn't leave your phone on in class because then its easier to concentrate what teacher is telling you. If your phone is on then your phone will vibrate, ring, and bother you. Then the phone's noises will urge you to pick it up.

The bell ring's and its time for lunch or break time. Now, finally you can use your phone. Nobody is going to bother you and no teacher will be teaching you. So, now you can do whatever you want. Look at the text your friend gave you or call him. Also, no teacher or principle will come up to you and take your phone away because it's your time to do whatever you want.

The two terms given are policies that both have reasonable pros and cons to each subject. Allowing students to bring phones to school and obligating them to use such devices during lunch periods and free times as long as the phones are off during teaching periods is one possibility. On the other hand, banning cell phones from school at any time and at any hour is another choice.

Although these policies hold different views and opinions to them, letting students carry cell phones in school should be authorized.

In any case of an emergency, students who are allowed to have a cell phone during lunch breaks and other free time can contact those in times of an emergency. Parents have always been concerned of the fact that in times of genuine trouble, they are not able to reach their child. Lock downs and fires are always a huge possibility during school and parents always stress that they must be the first to know the condition of their child. In case of any emergency, a student can call for help using a cell phone, arousing the awareness of others, such as teachers and students.

In addition to emergencies, schools that let students hold cell phones show a basis of trust and understanding of the student's predicament. Trust is an immense foundation that children need to learn to have and form with other individuals in society today. By letting students realize that they can be trusted, they themselves will show more respect and credence towards adults. To be responsible in life is a goal that each individual must achieve. Starting with trust, students will learn to be responsible. Their understanding of the rules and regulations that go along with privileges will be made clear and those who break such rules will face the necessary consequences.

Allowing cell phones in school during appropriate times is not necessarily a necessity, but a privilege that should be given to responsible students. For emergency purposes, the use of cell phones may lessen any casualties during schools hours. As a life goal, our community must instill trust with each other and hold the responsibilities with such privileges.

Therefore, the first step is to allow cell phones in school for the use of rational purposes only during specified times.

I believe that you should not allow students to have phones during school here is why.

first the reason should not be any phones in school is the student might try to sneak the phone under a book a desk any were the phone cannot be seen. By doing this they will get really distracted during class and when its time for a test or what ever there going to fail it.

the second reason there should be no cell phones is because who is the student going to call or text. The student must have everyone that goes to that school on his or her contact list why just not talk to your friend when you are allowed to talk.

Final reason there should no phones is because I know students will say its just for emergencies why when every room has about two phones in each class. if there is really a emergency just take turns calling each others parents.

In the consideration of having the ability to allow phones at school or not has brought to my attention that this could be a chance to change a rule in our school.

High school students really consider their phone a main need in their everyday routine. Since they're not allowed at school many students get in trouble for sneaking around and getting caught playing with them on their free time. Teachers don't like the idea of having phones in school because they are a distraction to school work or other students. Many kids that are allowed to have there phones at school don't really focus on class work or the lesson, instead they ignore and want to hurry and get their work done so they could play on their phones. Also, they could distract another classmate doing there work if they are playing on their phone during class.

On the other hand, phones can be useful when your at school by contacting parents or guardians when needed, remembering assignments by setting a note or reminder on their phones, or even by contacting a teacher when absent. They can use them during free time or lunch period to talk to friends, but when the bell rings for class they have to be turned off until allowed to get them back out.

I would rather be able to have phones at school so if I got sick, or if a event was canceled, and even just to see how so somebody is doing. With a chance of allowing phones at school could make my day easier and never forget my homework.

080E2CA04B67,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I personally believe that you should stick with Policy 2 - do not allow students to have cell phones in school at all. Students are getting let loose too much nowadays. I, as a student, have seen myself the chaos cell phones can create. Students steal other students' phones for fun, and the student gets angry and annoyed and begins a verbal fight, which distracts from the other students from learning and the teachers from doing their job.

Students walk and drop their phones all the time, and the next day they come to the police officer's office to ask them to look for their phone, and then they have to go through the whole process of marking down information, asking people if they've seen the phone, and investigating, maybe even going to court. If students were not allowed to bring phones, this problem would never occur.

I have seen way too many students texting in class when it is totally clear that they are not allowed to. They text under tables and desks. They text behind books and binders. They pretend to drop pencils and paper just to bend down to check their phone. A fellow student once asked me if I could move in front of her so that she could use text. In fact, some kids purposely choose seats in the back for that purpose. I even witnessed a student who had hid their phone up their sleeve, and whenever it vibrated, they would pull the sleeve to make room to see it and reply, then cover it up again. Unbelievable, right?

Students who have their own mobile internet or 4G go on social networking sites such as Facebook all the time, right under the table. They take pictures and upload them. They go on Youtube and use their phone as a makeshift music player. They check their mail. With phones like that, there's not much need for computers and laptops anymore, except the difference in speed. Once the phones begin to load faster and be able to store more memory, phones in school will be everywhere.

Even the most innocent child could be lurking behind a textbook texting. And that reminds me of something my friend joked to me about. ""Do you know why those big books in our school are called textbooks?"" ""Uh, because they're filled with text?"" ""No, stupid. Because you can text behind them. You use them to text!"" Cheesy, but pretty true and only a small taste of how phones are changing schools and learning. Students are even redefining words! Amazing what a tiny electronic can do!

Phones need to go. Like, for real. Don't take those excuses of ""Oh but I need my phone to tell my mom that I'm coming home late!"" or

""I need to tell RELATIVE_NAME

that I can't come over after school! Please let me use my phone!"" That's no excuse for taking out your phone. There are at least 100 phones in the school - use those for your communication or reminding purposes. If there's a fire there are still going to be 100 phones for you to use. And if you're getting abused or kidnapped somewhere you shouldn't have gone away from school grounds alone - that is your fault.

So you see TEACHER_NAME, there's no need for phones. They cause more bad then good. They should be banned.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I believe the better of the two choices is policy one. I think students should have the opportunity to at least to be able to have a cell phone during a school's provided free time. It would make a lot of more people more prone to like going to their school better anyways, because they don't feel imprisoned within the school walls, like another school could make you feel like but if it were to happen in most schools some kids would take it as an excuse to use their phones during class. But if they were put on a trial period they could see who the more responsible kids with their phones are and make some sort of requirement to be able to use their phone in free time at all. Because some people don't have to work for anything and they just get it handed to them rather it would be by a rich parent or grandparent there comes a point where the hard working people should get rewarded.

Phones could get stolen, and if students have time to be on their phone in school they probably wont turn them off in class. Phones are a huge distraction and texting has become one to. Students grades may fall dramatically due to the fact that they could possibly get away with texting in class. If a students phone was stolen then the parent would probably become very upset with the school board for allowing that to happen. Trying to get the phone back would be a useless attempts.

Having phones during lunch or at any free time is not a bad idea, but the problems that come with that are. Yes students would be excited that they could have their phones but it's a huge risk. There are many students who have failed to graduate because of failing classes, and being able to have your phone out at all or on your person at all again causes a distraction and could possibly lead to grades dropping dramatically. Students are the future of our would. We need doctors, scientists, vets, teachers etc. to have a successful future.

Now if you had everybody's cell phone in a box or something like that during classes and give them to the students during the free times that wouldn't be so bad, but there is always the possibility of losing a phone. With that said it isn't smart to have students with their phones out at all during school. The students may be upset with the decision of no phones but with explaining the reasonings for it their is a possibility that they understand why you chose that. Respect from other students is possible to. For some reason students bully others about their phones because ""it isn't cool"" so that could also prevent bullying.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

dying in a hospital bed is my grandpa with a blood clot stuck in his heart and i don't find out until the end of the day because my parents had no way of getting in touch with me, considering i was at school and my phone wasn't aloud to be turned on. So there I am, walking into the hospital seeing my grandfather laying on a bed with all the life sucked out of him. I didn't even get to have my last words with him before he passed away. Therefore i believe that cell phones should be aloud to be turned on during lunch and in between classes because, its a good way of communication in case of emergencies and its also a way of just talking to your friends.

Now imagine, a school of lots of happy kids communicating with all their friends and putting them in the most perfect mood possible all because cell phones are aloud to be used during some part of school hours.

I don't think that having phones out during lunch and in between classes is a big deal at all. I mean, what is the difference. As long as the phones are turned off during class how can it possibly bother anybody? In case of emergencies or with family issues, it can always be useful to be able to check your cell phone for voice mails, missed calls, or text messages.

Also , I think kids should be aloud to communicate with their friends during a part of school incase they want to plan something later, or help each other with a school project or even just to text each other for fun. Now a days technology is so outstanding kids can send and receive messages to each other within 15 seconds! Why not take advantage and use the technology we have now? I don't think that using phones during lunch or between period can honestly make anybody mad at all so make it happen.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

In my opinion I think that cell phones would be ok to have in or at lunch and other free time that students are given. Schools are linnet and let us use our cell phones as long as its not in a class, but most of us feel as if we are breaking the rules. I think that in order for students to not feel like they have to be sneaky about cell phones in school, is to allow students to use their cell phones during the free time that students are given.

Most all students in junior high and high school have cell phones and bring them to school. I do not see the problem with having cell phones at school, but I believe the reason teachers have become so strict with the policy is because students are misusing the freedom that teachers have given. Also I think that students that enjoy to break the rules use their cell phones against authority because they know that it will upset the teachers that fallow the rules the most.

As students I think that we should have the right to use cell phones as long as we do not abuse the privilege of being able to use our cell phones in school, instead of not being able to use them at all. In most cases there are few students who abuse their cell phones. They abuse it by cyber bullying and other things that are not appropriate at any age epically our age alone. In many cases children our age are given cell phones by their parents for a reason, and that reason is not so that the child can text but so that the parents can reach them at any given time of the day and so in case of an emergency the parent or child can reach one another.

Many kids my age are not using cells phones for the right reason and its causing a great issue in the United States. Not only is texting in school becoming a problem but texting and driving is also becoming an issue as well. Most all students bring their cell phones to school weather its so that at the end of the day they can reach their parents or because they use it during school hours to text others that are in school as well. I and many other students keep their cell phones turned off during school so that they do not get on trouble and leave it in their lockers as well. In conclusion, students should be able to use their cell phones if they do not abuse it.      ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4

You are trying to decide which policy that you should apply in school. The first policy allows students to bring their phones to school and use it during lunch or free times. I think that this policy should not be applied to the school. Instead, you should apply policy 2 which students are not allowed to bring their cell phones at school at all. I agree with policy 2 because when the students phone rings during class, it distracts students from learning and teachers from teaching. Also, if you allow students to bring their phones to school and they use their phones to cheat on tests by texting other students.

Students carry their cell phones to school.

We understand that they need their phones for emergency. However, cell phones are becoming a big distraction to the class. This distracts the class because when the phone rings, all students give their attention to the phone that is ringing. Yesterday, my friend forgot to turn of his phone so when his phone rang, everyone started laughing about the ring tone so, it distracted everyone in my class. Also, when the phone rings, it stops the teacher from teaching the class. My teacher is teaching us in a fast pace because we have the annual C.M.T tests in 2 weeks. But, when the a students phone rang, the teacher had waste his time trying to take the students phone because the student doesn't want to give his phone to the him. In addition, by the time my teacher took the phone away from him, the class ended and we barely learn the important subjects.

Here are some reasons and examples why students shouldn't bring their phones to school. When their are tests, the student doesn't give all of their effort. Instead, they cheat on their test. The worst thing about that is they use their phone to contact another student and help them cheat on their test. They do this by secretly texting each other. When they text, they give each other the answer to the test. This is wrong so this is why cell phones should be banned from school.

In summation, the reason why phones shouldn't be allowed in school is that it distracts the class and students use it to cheat on test. If you still feel that policy 1 should be applied in the school, then you made a            ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.6

I would like to inform you about which policy i think the school should have. I will explain to you why we should have that policy an why not. I will start by telling you about policy 1 first then policy 2.

I think policy 1 is a pretty good policy because it allows us students to carry around our phones an let us use then at sometimes of the day. I also think it is a pretty good policy because if we have our phones an something terrible happens we can call some one so they can help. Even if all those things are great i think some students will try to take advantage of the school policy. I also think some students wont even listen to the school policy.

I think policy 2 is a great policy because their are a lot of students that like to use their phone during class an this policy makes sure they don't. I also think its a great policy because teachers wont have to worry if someone has a phone. Even if its a great policy sometimes us students made need then just in case we need them if we stay for a after school program. Plus some students made need them just in case if they need something.

Those are my reasons why I think these policies are ok and not ok but if I was you I would chose the one you think you wont have problems with.

I understand that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I realize that you are considering two policy. Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. And, not allowing students to us cell phones at all at school. I think that you should allow students to use the cell phones during free time.

I believe that you should allow students to use their cell phones. If they can use their cell phones during free time they won't have the urge to use the cell phones during class. When they use them during free time they talk to all the people that want to talk to. Some people don't get to see their friends during free time so they will most likely call or text to their friends during free time. If they cant call or text during free time at all they will try to text during class so that they can talk. If students cant bring their cell phones to school then they could not use their phone for after school activities or an emergency.

There are some disadvantages to letting students use their cell phones during free time. One, letting them use their cell phones during free time makes them want to text or call more so, they might do it during class. ii they do that then it will take away from their learning.

It could go either way on this decision. But, being a student i would like to be able to use my cell phone during free time. I also do a lot of after school activities so, i wouldn't be able to call my mom for a ride if i needed one. I think the parents would choose policy one because some parents like to keep in touch with their children.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent,0.4
F038D8A7DF32,"Dear school principal,

I am writing to you to talk about the school policy about phones. I can see why you have considered the rule of not having phones at all and a lot of students don't like it and its because sometimes students don't get the same class as their friends and they want to talk to them or have something important to tell them, but where students brake the rule is when they go behind the teachers back and start texting there friends. I really don't think that's right because then your not really learning anything so then what would be the reason for attending school then.

The policy I'm going with would have to be policy two. Policy two sounds the fairest and most reasonable rule, because students are still going to bring phones either way and that's a fact now whether they get caught or not is another topic. Well anyways i think that rule is great because sometimes students finish work early or have nothing to do but sit there, so why not let them use there phone? But it would only be in free time and that means no rushing through work either so you can just use the phone. I think its fair also to get to use your phone in lunch or recess because we are in school for about eight hours a day. I believe that's a lot of time without talking to your friends, or having breaks, or just having fun. So why not let us text in lunch

I mean we have been in class for hours and doing our work so we deserve a reward or break. Lunch time is also our time to interact with friends so that would be one way we can communicate. What I'm trying to say is that if we don't use them in class, and we behave, we get to use our cell phones during lunch or free time. To me this policy sounds correct it doesn't interact, or interfere with the schools learning process, and even better the students can take this as a reward.

So as you can see this is what I believe would be fair and would be great for the students and for yourself because students wouldn't use their phone in class any more considering that they can use it in free time or lunch now. those are my reasons why my school should go with policy number two. I hope I have convinced you to pick this rule and I hope the students can go with their part of the deal. Thank you for your time and I hope I have gave you something to think about.

I would like to thank u for reading this letter. I would personally prefer Policy 1, because if the students are responsible then they should be able to use there phones in free time such as lunch hour. Students should turn cell phones off in any hour of the day in which the are learning. If caught with phone on or still having the same texting conversations as lunch or previous periods then a proper form of punishment should be given. The reasons young adults should be given the choice to bring or not to bring their phones is because they need to know if you make a choice and get in trouble that they need to take the punishment.

Policy 2 is an unfair unlike Policy 1 which give us a choice. Policy 2 is like taking an agenda from a hard working lawyer or doctor. It is something they need to make through the day just as young adults need their phones. Us using our phones help us keep in touch with our parents like on game days and you are supposed to ride the bus and your parents need to find you. Now the phone usage on the bus is the same policy as the school. They always have those ""NO CELL PHONE USAGE"" signs up.

I am coming to you with this letter because i believe students should be allowed to bring their phones to school if they are smart with it. I would most certainly choice Policy 1 but this is just a letter to persuade you.

Again thank you for taking the time to read this letter and for considering Policy 1 in your school.

I think that policy 1 that student can bring cell phone to school because you do think that bring cell phones is not important but it's good idea that they for allow in the schools .

For example is policy 2 said that not to bring cell phone want will happened with student have if is some big is happened in school and that you can't cell your parent and they think that some big is bad in the school .The policy 2 is not fair students have a chose to bring the cell phones to school and that the policy 1 be the one and fair to all students and that it will not cause trouble with anyone and that they . My point is that the use of the cell phones maybe of use but if the student use the cell phones in the free time that they can use it like lunch or in a place that can't see you use it but in the class the cell phones can be off or on vibrate so can't hear it when people are take to you.

I think students shouldn't be aloud to bring their cellular devices to school because it will be a distraction. If you let student use them through out passing periods, lunch periods, or other free times it will encourage them to use it when they feel they need to. Instead of them doing their work they would text, use the web for social networking, listen to music, and etc.

Then you will begin to question yourself, why are grades dropping?, what are they learning?, and are they paying attention?. Well the answers to your questions would be, grades will drop because they aren't paying attention to what the teachers are teaching them. Student's need to spend more time off their cell phones gossiping about unnecessary things and focus on getting their work done and learning new things so that they would be successful in life.

They need to have their mind focused on one thing only and that is their education!

Policy 1 i believe in cause everyone is already using phone during class or out of the class room even in lunch so policy 1 is better than policy 2.

The reason i pick policy 1 is people are using phone in school already and some times the teacher catch kids but some time they don't i don't know we like our phone so we maybe want to use our phone anywhere, any day, any time that why u should let us our phones during school time.

Second reason, i think it fair if we use our phones cause i bet all school in this world teacher use their phone that is a other reason. it unfair that the grow ups can but not us they need to do theirs job then if we need to do ours job and i hope you think about that to see us feel about it.

Third reason, kids get stuff done and they don't have nothing else to do instead let us use in that time and we will be little happy.

Our School has changed a lot over the years, now we have better technology and different projects that we do in class. Yet my main concern to you is Cell Phones. I strongly agree that Policy 1 is most certainly the best choice; Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. The reasons why is simply because if you tell them otherwise to not bring them at all, they still will. Also parents will complain if there child does not have there cell phone with them at all times. Yet if you allow the students to have their cell phones with them but turned off during class is the perfect policy. Then as the Policy states they can have them during their own time, like during lunch and breaks.

You may be thinking that this is not a good idea, but it really is a very great policy. Even though cell phones are a major distraction when it comes to education. It is a force of habit that if you own a cell phone you will most likely always have it in your pocket or your bag. I do recommend that if a student is caught with a cell phone that they take it away from the student and give it back to the owner at the end of the day. But if you band having cell phones like in policy 2 the student body will get very offended and not even obey that policy.

Another reason why i say Policy 1 is the way to go is because if any emergency's where to happen the child would have their phone to get notified by. Even though the School does this with their own phone system it is still important because, if a problem came up with one of their Aunts or other close family members the School Board would have no clue.

As well as if a child needs to say after they have a fast way to notify their parents or gardenias. Or if they needed to take a bus home or go with another parent or friend to reach home after school they would have a fast way to notify their parents or gardenias, and lastly if they got locked out of their house after coming home from School they would have a cell phone with them to notify their parents or gardenias. So i strongly agree that Policy 1 is the one you should choose, so i hope that you do!

I really think you should go with policy one. because kids in school will start to take them out anyway and you will have to take tons of phones away. The students will not be happy with policy one because it prohibits all cell phones. Cell phones do not cause controversy. if you were to take cell phones away completely it will make kids in your school create riots. They will be angry at teachers for not allowing people to have their phones out during lunch hours.

I really think you should allow cell phones on campus. As long as they do not take them out in class it should be ok. Also some parents tell their kids to never turn their phone off in case of emergency. i really think that is a big deal. What if something is going on at home and they need you to know about it as soon as possible. You would have no idea what happened until you left school and got home. Something really severe could have happened during that time.

Another reason you should allow cell phones as in policy one is that if you didn't allow them at all and anybody took them out they would be taken. Kids would be really angry. They would start to go on riots and get extremely mad at the principal for allowing this rule. Nobody in your school would be happy and it would be torn apart. Sometimes kids have medicine and their parents have to contact them but they would not be able to because of the policy.

Please allow kids to have their cell phones out during passing periods and lunch time. It would save the school so much grief. The kids in your school would like to be there. But also now how the times are you have touch screens and unlimited internet search and things like that. People would go crazy because they cant do all that during passing periods and lunch.

When you would get home you would spend all of your time on your phone and not doing homework. So please i say once more, allow kids to use their phones during passing periods and lunch.
