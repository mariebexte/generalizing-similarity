Also there was hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up which takes more  energy so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat, finally, because of the terrain he was riding on the animals he ran into, a snake, could have hurt him.

For example in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist had to endure going over big dirk hills while being dehydrated and tired from biking miles and miles to get to a destination. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the short story; started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait. The setting controls how long it takes you to getts your destination and how you get there.

As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he ""rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. ""Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.  """,3,3,3,3
6427,3,"In the start story Do not exceed speed limit,"" time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of california in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclist's dehydration.

This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh.

6516,3,"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn't prepared for the reality of his ride.

It really looked like a diamond back"" That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to ""ease post"" it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was ""replaced by short, rolling hills"" which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills.

In the story it states, I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, ""Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1.

6686,3,Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill.

6915,3,"In Joe Kurmaskie's ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1"" the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn't worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn't have been so worried. What's interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn't have struggled so much at the end.
