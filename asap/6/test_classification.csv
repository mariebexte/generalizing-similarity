14840,6,The builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building were faced with obstacles while attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. The architects realized they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the framework which could cause it to collapse. They strengthened the framework from the bottom of the building to the top before putting the shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower on the top of the building. The builders were faced with these obstacles but they were successful in completing their goal. The mooring mast is not used as a docking station but it is still looked at as the final peice that makes the Empire State Building stand out above all buildings in downtown New York City.,2,3,3,3
14841,6,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Luested, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. One obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified. After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The result of the expirament were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass. Within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles, as transportation, were long forgotten.",3,3,3,3
14874,6,"Based on the story it all started when they had build the empire state building and the workers should have knowned that the building was too big for the wind climate, up in the sky and plus when you make a building like that you have to make sure it's strong enough to keep balance.                         They faced problem's like when the U.S. tried to make a deal with them if they would let them use the top of the building for a dock to let civilians on the deck, and after they made a law that no more blimps can land on the dock a blimp attempted to land on the dock.",1,1,1,1
14889,6,"In the excerpt, The Mooring mast by Marcia Amidon Luested, the readers learn that there are obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the readers learn that the architects are worried about the load of the blimp and the wind pressure that is transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The architects would have to strengthen and modify the Empire State Building for it to be accustomed to this new situation. The architects also saw problems with foreign dirigibles which use hydrogen rather than helium as said in paragraph @NUM2, ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" One of the biggest obstacle was how the winds on top of the building were always shifting so even if the dirigible is tethered to the mast, the back would still swivel around. Later on, the architects idea for a mooring mast disapperead and it was then used for observation.",3,3,3,3
14891,6,"When they build the Empire State Building they faced obstacles building it. An obstacle they faced was that they wanted to make it as high and as safe as possible. The way the architetures wanted to make it the tallest building in the world was by putting a mooring mast on the top of the building. A mooring mast is basically a dock for dirigibles (blimps). This was dangerous. It was because the Mast could snap at such a high altitude and plumate to the ground or snap, and dangle high above the street. ""... The Government people in washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast,"" says Al Smith four year term governor of New York. Although it may look nice, its not the safest idea.",1,1,1,1
14915,6,"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One of which being that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used Hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. If a blimp were to be damaged over New York, many people could be hurt. Also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. Winds made the blimps very unstable. If one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the line around the mast. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any ship to even approach the mast.",2,3,3,3
14917,6,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock this included not being able to put a mooring mast at the top of the building in fear that because the dirigible was being held by a ""single cable"" it ""would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 with the amount the dirigible @PERSON1 and the wind the buildings frame would not be strong enough and would have to be ""modified and strengthened.""

14922,6,"Though in theory the idea of the mooring mast seemed attainable, in reality there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An initial problem was faced during the process of adding the mooring mast to the building. As stated in the article: ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ... The steel frame... would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" This modification, necessary to overcome the obstacle of attaching the mooring mast consumed over @NUM1 thousand dollars and much time and effort. A second obstacle which interfered immensely with safety was ""nature itself."" The violent winds at the top of the building would cause tethered dirigibles to ""swivel around and around"" the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in airfields could be weighted down by lead weights, but this idea could not be executed because ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Such problems as these created many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building.",3,3,3,3
14953,6,"In ""The Mooring Mast"" many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Many of the reasons had to do with safety. Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good many things could of gone wrong. The Empire State building was a enormous structure for it's time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on ""winds""  would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to menuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countrys such as @LOCATION2 used ""hydrogen"" in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were ""hailed"" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State building lookd good they still had to be care ful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city.",3,3,3,3

The modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building once the builders finally had all the modifications and building done; they were faced with a whole new set of obstacles. Most of the dirigibles from out of the united states were filled with flammable hydrogen. ""The german dirigible @CAPS1 was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey"". This accident worried @CAPS2. Also they faced problems with the shifting winds and air currents that made it difficult to dock the dirigibles.

How to dock a dirigible to the side of a building was one of the biggest concerns, but the amount of stress this would cause was an even bigger worry.  But the greatest obsticle to this project was the wind, nature itself.  The fear was that the wind would blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, and tethering the dirigible was not an option for safety reasons.  Due to the architect's inability to overcome these obsticles the Empire State Building was never used for it's original purpose.",2,2,2,2

15174,6,"The Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles serverely affected the building attemp of the dirigible dock. For instance, The Empire State building is located in a very dense urban location. At the time most dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen insted of Helium. The main difference between the two was that Hydrogen is more flamable then Helium. So if the Hydrogen from the dirigible was to ignit then a castistrophic fire would arise. The effects could be as devistating as the Hindenburg which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced the architectures and enginners to look for a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem though. Strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If winds were to blow a docking dirigible offcourse then the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown offcourse will docking then the pedistrians on the ground level could be injured.",2,3,3,3
15200,6,"In the process of building the dock for dirigibles, builders faced some obstacles. The first obstacle builders faced, was the lack of suitable landing area. If there wasn't area to land, there was no reason or way to build it. Also, the builders would have to remodel the whole building. After the building was framed to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was done, so it took even longer.The greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself, because the winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting, so there was no way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without crashing. The final obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low to the urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building.As you can see, there were many obstacles, and the mast wasn't useful. It was a great idea. But in my opinion it was a waste of time and money.",3,4,4,3
15214,6,The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced is that the architects made the Empire State Building more dirigibles. The architects put the thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building that is held by the cable tether. The dirigible's have to go through the wind pressure which was about eleven hundred feet below. The frame of the Empire State Building have to be strong and it cost more than sixty thousand dollars of modification to made the building's framework. The architects changed the design and made something new. The architects have a difficult obstacles of building the Empire State Building is to make it dirigibles.,1,1,1,1
15220,6,"In the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Luested, the author talks about the many obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. The first obstacle they faced involved dropping the mast onto the buildings flat roof. This task would be easy because using a single cable to lower the mast would add a great deal of stress to the buildings frame. Another problem they faced was nature. The violent winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. The greatest obstacle involved safety. Lots of blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 use highly flammable helium, rather than hydrogen. Helium makes the dirigibles more likely to cause an explosion, and risk many lives of the people of New York. Lastly, existing laws in New York @CAPS1 the balloons to dock. Airships were flying dangerously close over urban areas. Many obstacles were faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building that were mentioned in the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Luested.",2,3,3,3
15278,6,The builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem is the docking a dirigible to the roof would add too much stress on the frame. Another is having all the flammable gases above a highly populated area. Also there was already a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly the wind constantly changing direction would make the ship to unstable.,2,2,2,2
15349,6,"The builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. One thing was just simply the building would not have been strong enough to hold the dirigibles weight. Due to that fact that, they had to strengthen all the framework on the entire building. They had to put in sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to its framework. Also having the right equipment on the dirigibles served as a problem. The dirigibles didn't have the right docking tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast. The back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue When it came to docking. Another problem was most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was highly flammable and they didn't want something that could easily catch fire near the building like that",3,3,3,3
15352,6,"There were many problems with the designing of the dirigible docking system. The first of these problems comes from the practicality of the consept. The winds created by the updrafts in the cities are violent and making landing a blimp too risky, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obsticale that was faced was the strutural design. The Empire State Building was not originally designed to moor blimps, and modifying the building to do so was expensive, ""over @NUM1 doolars' worth of modifications,"" The final obsticale was the fact that there were laws in place stopping airships from flying too low over buildings, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These impracticalities prooved to be challenging obsticales",3,3,3,3
15374,6,During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders had to face many @CAPS1 in attempting to allow driggibles to dock there.     In the reading selection The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Luested it discusses many of the @CAPS1 that were faced. For an example an obstacle they had to face was finding a landing area because there was a huge lack of suitable landing area in New York City. The second @CAPS1 they faced was how to make dirigible's global so they had a meeting with the president of a formed airship transport company would use the dirigable's service across the pacific ocean. The architects had meetings with the government about safeways of mooring airships to this mast.     The builders went through many @CAPS1 to use the dirigibles but eventually it wasn't enough to Put the Plan into affect.,1,1,1,1
15433,6,"During the times of the Empire State Building and it's claim to fame with height, it's @CAPS1 Al Smith, faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of it's construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped the record for the highest building.",3,3,3,3
15469,6,"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Luested, there were many factors in the way of dirigibles docking at the mooring mast. When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" went up in flames in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building realized quote how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle was the existing law against low-flying airships in urban areas. This law makes is so that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle of all however, was mother nature. The winds that high in the sky were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

Architects also had to find a way to redesign the building so that it support the weight of the dirigible. The biggest obstecle, they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and although it would be tied down to the building the back of it would still be swirling, they didn't have a way to fix that, because usually dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field and it would be to risky to do that over a populated area.",2,3,3,3

The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. The soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area.The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have rapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization.

This was not an easy task; in fact it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be on top of the building, and its height and weight and wind pressure on the building was dangerous. In paragraph nine it is stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major obstacles. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium-which is highly Flammable. A fire or explosion in the location that the mooring mast was to be located would be devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached ed unless legislation was changed. All of these obstacles made it very hard to dock dirigibles on top of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, However to blimps did attempt to land there.
