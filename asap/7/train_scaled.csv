Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said. @CAPS1 get on another ride then"". We already tried the other rides,"" my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn't desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they're holding you up, but it's the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don't shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don't think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you'll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride.""",8,9,17,0.5666666666666667

Although I got through it. Now the worst thing was when I got to @LOCATION1 it was very hot out. We had to stand outside to wait for the bus. It got so hot that I lost all my patients and got so angry at everyone that I thought I was going to blow up! Only because I didn't want to wait for the ride anymore.

The dane's rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. ""@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?'' whispered @PERSON1.

17881,7,Patience what is it really? Do any of us have it? I think if we think about it we could all be patient.

I could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still. Another example about patences is when the miners got stated in the mine in @LOCATION2 for @NUM1 days they had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when the were coming up from the mine in that little elevator thingy magig. One last example on patence is when you are walking in a group with other people you have to be patient and listen to there ideas and let them do some of the work. These I think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient.,6,6,12,0.4

17899,7,"@CAPS1! Look out!"" @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here's a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. It's unbearable to watch. Ambulences' sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And that's @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, I'd lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5'd never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn't made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I'd still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe it's just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldn't know because in no way we we typical. When we aren't fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. ""@CAPS4"", @CAPS5 starts, ""I know I haven't been patient with you lately, and for that I'm sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing."" I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, ""I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?"" @CAPS5 didn't have to explain any farther. ""@CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around,"" my voice caught in my throat, ""just to get my stupid notebook."" A single tear weaved its way down my face. ""@CAPS7, hunny!"" my mother teared up as @CAPS6. ""That doesn't make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!"" I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. ""@CAPS8,"" I said, regaining composure, ""that's how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8."" @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother's lips. ""I will wait then."" And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect.""",12,12,24,0.8

18134,7,Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don't complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don't get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you should'nt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don't have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.,7,5,12,0.4

If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, you're quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when you're waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates aren't doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that you've lost, and you've enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened I've experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what I'm trying to say is that when you're patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you @MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isn't a bundle of roses"" all the time, so soon or later, you're going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isn't human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, I'm certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently.""",9,7,16,0.5333333333333333

After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt.

One example is if your waiting to buy a ticket or waiting to get gas you have to wait your turn to get it. Lastly patience is important because without patience wouldn't be able to read.

18720,7,Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I have been patient everyday in school. Being patient with my teachers. I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I don't have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world don't have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span. I don't think if I didn't have any patients I wouldn't be in school right now cause some kids just have problems and they and don't have and they get bad grades and everything.,5,5,10,0.3333333333333333

If you. are impatient and you are standing in line you would be mean to other people by like saying hurry up I want to be on that ride or hurry up and start the ride allready. There is the example.

That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next mandd, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructer. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn cernal and lack of thirst was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away not just a few, but I didn't argue. The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home.

I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point- the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order. This I didn't mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since  the line was nearly an hour and a half long.

One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm.

When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!,10,12,22,0.7333333333333333
