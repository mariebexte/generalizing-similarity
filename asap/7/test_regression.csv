18068,7,"Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I'm going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor's office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that's why. The morning probably wasn't really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor's office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said I have an appointment for my son."" And the lady at the front window said ""the @NUM1 appointment?'' ""@CAPS1 that's the one"" said my dad .""

My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good.

18326,7,"Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear them.",6,5,11,0.36666666666666664

So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you don't complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you.
