20717,8," Softball has to be one of the single most greatest sports alive; playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine. I love the dirt that sticks to your face, the sweat dripping from your forehead, and the gallons and gallons of water you poor all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering @CAPS2. Although I love softball I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates, are the things you remember the most through out your softball career. I have always had great memories through softball many laughs, tears, and frustrations so when I had the opportunity to play on a top notch team I looked forward to all the many more memories I would have.  Hood @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was my team name, I had played almost four years with this local team. Many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them. I felt like I had my set team, I was going to play with these girls all though high school and we would become even closer. As my fifth year now approached I was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe I play for a team not as locally, that idea was also very enticing. I now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended; or play with a team I knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better then me, and looked down upon me. As I looked at the pros and cons of both teams I decided no; I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at. At that point softball was just around the corner and I began to reanalyze everything. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player; maybe i could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. I then decided I would take a chance and try for this team.  As my dad and I drove to the field where I would try out for this team, my stomach was in knots. I wanted this team to like me, I was playing all the possible ways in my head I could greet them so i didn't sound snobby or a grump. The time moved quickly and I wished it would slow; my heart felt like it was beating a million times per second. I was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it, soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said ""ready or not here we come"". Nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I was second guessing every move I made, I even had troubles removing my seat belt.  As I approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion, walking by I saw all the girls turn there heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. My first thought was to run; that was it I didn't want to go, I was done I wanted home I was ready to start my year with the @CAPS2, I just couldn't take it. Then as I walked onto the field they all grew a smile. Each and everyone of them told me their names, there favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. I found myself laughing through out my whole try out, there were no awkward moments and I enjoyed my time there. I couldn't wait to go back, I now had made new friends, friends I knew I would grow close with. My year with this team was amazing I have friendships with these girls that I never would have discovered if I hadn't gone. Those girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. Laughter played a very big role in the decision I made to play with this team, if I had just gone and tried out, and had I not had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the @CAPS2. I have had great memories with the @CAPS2, but also softball is all about going out discovering new friendships; therefore, enjoying the sport as well as the people.",21,26,46,0.7666666666666667

20747,8," These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody.",18,20,38,0.6333333333333333
20754,8,"Making someone laugh is the best feeling to their soul, and it is one step closer to internal happiness. People might say that when feeling something good inside the body its when they know that they have done something right. I agree with this because it has happen to me; I was feeling down about something that I cant even remember but, when I felt the need to help someone do something I knew inside of me that I did something very special at that moment. It's amazing how you make someone laugh, and it doesn't matter where you are, you also feel happy. The one person in my life that has a great sense of humor is my mother. She is always in need of something funny.People enjoy laughing so much that it is if they were to take some sort of energy drink to make them not want to stop laughing. I hear people say that laughter is very healthy for a human soul, and it will also make the soul and body last longer. Laughter is a way of expressing yourself without having to say much. It could be a great way to start a conversation with a person. Positive thinking leads to making good choices especially if happiness leads you on in life. By making someone laugh it makes the awkwardness go away. It is better to laugh then to be sad.Everyone has their addiction to something in which they need to depend on. My mom's addiction is laughing. She laughs at work and she especially laughs at the house whenever I'm around. Although, sometimes she feels down whenever something goes wrong. I hate seeing her like this, because it then makes me feel down. When she is feeling sad it is if there is nothing in the world that would make her cheer up. If one person is feeling depress, that feeling passes on to the next person closest to them. Eventually I get tiered of seeing my mom like this and in this situation I cant help it but to get up and start doing some ridiculous stuff to cheer her up. Some things that pop into my mind is that I can start dancing funny or tell a little lie that might of happen at school that I think will cheer her up. When there is an opportunity to make someone laugh I enjoy to put a smile on their face.My mom means the world to me just as I mean the world to her. We try to help each other in any way as possible. This one day she came home from work and my dad was sitting in the table reading the newspaper and my mom walks in, and notices that my dad hasn't made food yet she started to flip out on him. She thought that it was stupid of him to not make dinner for us. She was pretty angry at him for a period of time, so she started to make us dinner but she was doing it all wrong. She was mixing the spices in the wrong pan, I was going to let her know that she was doing it all wrong, but my dad was holding me back so that I wouldn't get her more angry. She finally finish cooking and served us our plates but we didn't wanted to eat it because she made the food out of anger and made it smell funky. My dad forced us to eat it because he thought that by eating the food it would make her happy, but he was wrong it only made her feel worse because my youngest brother didn't like it. I felt bad so I had to do something funny that was going to put her in the mood to not be mad at my dad anymore. I turn on the @CAPS1 and changed the @CAPS2 to the music @CAPS2 and started to dance as if I were to have ants in my pants. Her lungs were about to burst because she was laughing so hard, and eventually she was in a good mood for the rest of the day.Everywhere I go I see people smiling and laughing about something and it only makes me wonder about the funny things that are being said. I think that it is a good thing for someone to feel good about themselves because it brings a positive feeling in the room. I enjoy to see people be happy because it always makes me feel happy. What better way to be happy when smiling is one step closer to laughing. My mom and I like to take walks just so that we wouldn't feel apart and stay closer to each other, we see different people each time we go walking and we always get a smile from them. That is the best feeling in the world, to feel joy is to be free from all your problems.",16,15,31,0.5166666666666667
20759,8," As I waited in the car, anxious to meet my best friend and man I'm in love with, I started to laugh. Not because something my mother or brother said was funny, or because I saw something funny, but I was nervous. I'd talked to him countless times on the phone, many many text messages, and countless emails. But I was still nervous. I knew him better than I knew most people, yet my anxiety seemed to be making me lose my sanity.  As our black rental sedan pulled up to where he was waiting outside of where his family lived, I got more nervous. @CAPS6 if he wasn't actually the way I thought he was? @CAPS6 if he didn't like me? @CAPS6 if I didn't like him? As soon as he stepped into the car, smiling brightly at me, my nervous laughter and my anxiety all melted away. I smiled back. ""@CAPS1, @PERSON1,"" he said. ""@CAPS1 @PERSON2,"" I said, butterflies in my stomach. I was smiling broadly still, he reached out and cautiously took my hand.  ""@CAPS3 was the drive?"" he asked, lightly squeezing my hand. ""@CAPS4, and nerve wracking,"" I replied, nervous laughter bubbling up again. ""@CAPS5 your here now, and I'm very happy @CAPS7 are,"" he said, smiling. And for the rest of the car ride to the restaurant our conversation flowed so smoothly I thought I was dreaming. Here him and I were two guys in love with one another, a new thing for both of us, and we were happy as can be. The whole car ride we held hands ad talked, I felt like I'd known him my whole life. Not just the year and a half I'd known him.  We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 all too fast and all of us got out of the car, I was famished and so was he. But we had to wait for a table for a half-hour before we sat down. Once at the dinner table my mother, who was very happy I found someone I loved so much and knew of our love, started regaling us with tales of my childhood. It was one of the most embarassing moments of my life. I was bright red for almost the entire time she told these stories. Some of which I remembered, others I did not. @PERSON2 laughed and joked wth me about all of them. Which made my nervous laughter come out as actual laughter. It also helped that he was holding my hand under the table.  After we ate dinner and dessert we went to the nearby mall for some shopping and to just hang out. My mom and brother went one way, and @PERSON2 and I went another. We bought some clothes together and finally ended up in a book store. My favorite book store, @ORGANIZATION3's. Back in my favorite section, young adult fiction, I noticed @PERSON2 staring at me. ""@CAPS6?"" I asked stupidly. He smiled deviously.  ""@CAPS7 just look very... In your element,"" he smirked.  ""@CAPS8?"" I said, in mock confusion. He just smiled and took my hand in his again. ""@CAPS9 problem,"" he said, squeezing my hand. He pulled me closer to him, we were the only people in this area of the store. ""@CAPS10 if I'm a little forward?"" he asked. I shook my head @CAPS9. He leaned in and kissed me very gently on the lips, I blushed a bright red and started to giggle after our lips parted. He quirked an eyebrow, I knew @CAPS6 he was thinking just by the look on his face.  ""That felt fantastic,"" I said, putting my fingers on my lips. I had a silly grin on my face.  ""@CAPS11,"" he simply said, kissing me again. ""I love your laugh, love,"" he told me, I was on cloud nine, I was truly in love with somebody and I felt great! I'd never been this happy before. Except maybe the first time I went to @ORGANIZATION2. But this was definitely better, because it could last much longer. Which it has, since we've been together ever since. Both our gazes fixed our future together. Now whenever I remember that I was start to giggle happily to myself. Yes I get a stare every once in a while, but I don't care. Laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and I. Making us the closest we've ever been.",23,24,47,0.7833333333333333
20762,8," Laughter is always the key to complete happiness, all you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember back in the @NUM1 grade, i was the new student and i sure can tell you that i didn't know where anything really was, it was a new school: new bus, new everything. Being the new student is something no one wants to be, you get made fun of alot and sometimes you just dont fit in. Well thats my story, i never fit in.  One day i was walking up the stairs to my class, and it was a bright sunny day, i dont believe there really was any clouds that day. Anyways, as i was walking up the stairs i tripped and fell backwards and my skirt i was wearing flipped up over my head, and of course in that era of time you had to have character underpants. Well i remember everyone pointing and laughing at me A. because i had just fell down, and @CAPS1. because i was wearing dora underpants. Therefore, i went the whole day with everyone laughing at me, but to tell you the truth, i laughed right along with them. I honestly thought it was pretty funny, falling down and your underpants show? who doesn't think that's funny? After the fact this girl named @CAPS2 came up to me and told me im not the only one who wears character underpants.We both laughed as hard as we could that whole day, just remembering the fact that me of all people, I fell down the stairs! Next, being the new kid that could actually be taking embarssing, but for me I have done it a million times, so it really didn't bug me as much as people thought it would. @CAPS2 and I, became such great friends, we laughed all the time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice cold water, or back to the time where i fell down the stairs. Up to this day we still talk about that, its just something you really don't get over. Not to mentioned it was pretty funny when my charcter underpants showed.  In conclusion, i think when the quote says ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" really is true, you have to have a good laugh before you can go on with your day, its just a known fact. If you dont laugh throughout your day then something is really wrong with you. Just because your getting older doesn't mean you have to throw away your laugh. Laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what is your funny story?",15,17,32,0.5333333333333333
20774,8,"When I was younger I liked to go fishing a lot. I always went with my two friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1.We loved to catch @CAPS1, @CAPS2 head, and sometimes @CAPS3. We did a lot of fishing while we were camping. One day when we were fishing for @CAPS2 head and it was not going very well. It was very cold and it was even snowing. We were about to leave when @PERSON1 hooked one on his last cast. He yelled t me that he was going to catch this on so I jumped off the four-wheeler and ran over to him. When I saw the fish I thought it was a @CAPS1. It was by far the biggest @CAPS2 head that we have ever seen.  While he was reeling it in he said that it was very strong and I could see that he was having trouble. After a few minutes he started to get the fish by the shore. We all started to relax and think that the day was going to be good now. Right as @PERSON1 told me to get the net he slipped and fell right in the river and he let go of the pole.At this time I thought we lost a fish and a pole but @PERSON1 was not thinking straight and he jumped in the water after the pole.   Once @PERSON2 and I saw him swimming and struggling we decided to jump in and help him catch his fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water after a pole and I was almost to it. Right as I got about a foot from the pole the fish started to swim faster. While I was trying to get the pole I was not focused on where I was going and I got caught on a tree so it was up to @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 to get the pole.  The chase for the floating fishing pole had now gone on for over five minutes and all of us were very far down the river. Now @PERSON2 was very close to the pole and @PERSON1 and I were just catching up to him. Suddenly, @PERSON2 yelled that he got the pole so we all swam to the shore to reel in the fish. At this time we were very happy that we went in the ice cold river to after this fish and we could not wait to get home and dry. After a few minutes @PERSON2 was still reeling in the huge fish. He said he did not know how he was going to get it to the shore. Once the fish got very close to the shore @PERSON2 jerked the pole as hard as he could to get it onto the bank but as he pulled the line broke and the fish got away. All of our hard work was not for anything. After that we decided that it was time to just go home and sit by the fire. A lot of people I tell this story think it is funny but personally i don't see anything funny about swimming in the snow to break your fishing line. One good thing is that this was the most memorable day of fishing I had ever had.",20,20,40,0.6666666666666666
20796,8," Laughter is an important element to have in life. Because without @CAPS3 there would be no happiness or joy in the world. @CAPS1 are a great source for laughter, @CAPS1 are the people you go to to be yourself. Some people use laughter for to release pain. For example, whenever @CAPS10 dad gets hurt he starts laughing. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 was in the navy a few years ago. And during training he got hit in the stomach. Nothing really was wrong, but @CAPS3 did hurt him. so @CAPS10 @CAPS2 sat down and started to laugh. I guess this so-called trait is hereditary because I find myself doing the exact same thing from time to time.  When I learned about how laughter heals, @CAPS3 wasn't too long ago. @CAPS3 was last @DATE3, @CAPS3 was early @DATE5 and @CAPS5 of @DATE5 was coming close. Traditionally me and @CAPS10 parents would drive to @ORGANIZATION1. And use the money we have been saving up all year round and buy a huge pack of fireworks.  Once @CAPS5 of @DATE5 came I was filled with joy, I woke up and immediately run up to @CAPS10 mom and ask ""@CAPS3's @CAPS5 of @DATE5 can I take the fireworks out to the package now?"" I was a new puppy discovering its first chew toy. @CAPS7 shook her head ""@CAPS6 yet @PERSON1, its only eleven in the morning. Sunset doesn't come around till seven or eight"" @CAPS7 smiled at me. ""@CAPS8 girl."" @CAPS7 whispered as @CAPS7 left the room.  Once the huge golden sun finally went down and the smaller bright shimmering stars appeared. We all knew @CAPS3 was time. ""@CAPS9 you like to do the honors?"" @CAPS10 dad handed me the first firework and a lighter. A big smile appeared onto @CAPS10 face without @CAPS10 control. I loved fireworks, I love bright colors watching them as they spewed into the newly lit sky, filling @CAPS3 with a sea of colorful sparks. After @CAPS5 of @DATE5 had ended @CAPS10 cousin @CAPS12 came over. @CAPS10 mom had was little sick but @CAPS3 wasn't something that was contagious. @CAPS10 @CAPS25 figured that we were old enough to take care for ourselves and for @CAPS10 mom. And @DATE3 was ending and I wanted to see the movie @CAPS13 with @CAPS10 mom and @CAPS12 so badly.  @CAPS10 mom had a lot going wrong her doctor put her on several medications to relieve her problems. but @CAPS3 seemed like @CAPS7 got a new pill from the doctor every week because the symptoms from each pill was causing more and more problems.  Its mid @DATE5, @DATE4, and still no sign of @CAPS10 mom getting any better. @CAPS12 and I took walks with the dogs to the near by park, we went swimming, watched @CAPS15, clean the cars, We would try to find anything to do really.  @DATE1 came, and @CAPS10 mom was showing signs of improvement @CAPS7 was walking more naturally . I called @CAPS10 dad and asked if he thought going to see a movie was a good idea. he said to wait one more day. I was worried about waiting another day because @CAPS12 was going home the next day. The next day, I woken up by the soft whisper of @CAPS10 moms voice. ""@LOCATION1, @PERSON1 honey wake up"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder. I opened @CAPS10 eyes slowly, opening them wider as @CAPS10 eyes focused of what was around me. ""@CAPS18 go to the movies?"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder once again. ""@CAPS19, but your sick."" I exhaled a heavy sigh. ""I am feeling a lot better today."" @CAPS7 smiled. ""@CAPS21 because the next showing is in twenty minutes."" The sudden rush to @CAPS21, woke me up. I then woke @CAPS12 up and we soon then left. The movie was good. Afterward, @CAPS12 went home and everything was silent once again, the rooms kept empty, the sun went away, the whole house stood still.  @DATE2. this day is usually a time to kick back. I was on @CAPS10 computer most of the day, @CAPS10 dad was playing his video game. and @CAPS10 mom was in the kitchen preparing dinner. @CAPS10 dad went in to help her with dinner. until @CAPS7 almost had fallen with a few pans in her hands. @CAPS10 dad suggested that @CAPS7 go and take a nap or at least lay down. Later that evening @CAPS10 dad had found @CAPS10 mother. laying stiff, cold...@CAPS10 mother had passed away in her sleep that day. I felt as if @CAPS10 heart had exploded like a firework. A few days have passed I stood still on the couch. I found comfort in texting @CAPS12. Told her what the doctors told us. @CAPS12 mentioned how torn @CAPS10 @CAPS25 was about @CAPS10 mom. And even though @CAPS12 was hurting inside, her and her @CAPS2 @PERSON2 tried to get @CAPS10 @CAPS25 and everyone to laugh. Because they knew that laughter would make some of the pain go away. And I think they are amazing for finding a bit of laughter in a dark place. That is why laughter is a important element of out lives. ",18,17,35,0.5833333333333334
20813,8," As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been streanthend by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are imporntant but they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain and if two people think in the same thing as being funny, it brings them together with their similar intrests.  By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, brings people around more easily. Since I was young I've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. I believe I am like this because my parents have always told me, ""People that are happy are the ones people want to be."" @CAPS1 by being a seemingly happy person it has given me the friends I have. Although I have never really understood what it ment because it could mean many differant things.  When ever I'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing about ourselfs, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. We could be doing absloutley nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times. It @MONTH1 be starting an argument that is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possiable. Most of the time we wont get butt hurt about it, but alot of the time we will take it to far. With all the laughter we have shared before it keeps us friends. Stupidity and pain are probly the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity would be if some one says something that doesn't make sence or came in at the wrong time. I have never under stood why we laugh at pain, maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain,although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. When someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it alot of the time I will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. They need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too. Laughter will always bring people to relationships. It show common intreasts and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into peoples life, with out happieness and laughter this world would be supper boring.",18,18,36,0.6
20830,8," My friend @PERSON1 and I have @CAPS1 friends from as back as sixth grade. We have @CAPS1 through so much together. Even though we don't have everything in common and we don't hang out, out side of school together, we have a lot of laughter in our friendship. I say that if you are gonna have a friendship that is gonna last, you have to have laughter in it to make it a fun friendship. When @PERSON1 and I where in @NUM1 grade, we where the biggest people to the sixth graders because we where in the highest grade in our middle school. We would have so much stuff to do. @PERSON1 and I would always walk down the hallways linking our arms together and one moment after another she would just push me into someone. That someone would plow into a locker or wall and we would just laugh are butts off. It was fun to us but the other people kinda minded, but not that bad.  Another thing we would do to make our self laugh would be when @PERSON1 and I would have big tickle fights. It would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each others mouths. I would always try to stick a piece of paper in her mouth and to get me to stop, @PERSON1 would tickle me. @PERSON1 new that I'm like the ticklish person on the face of the planet. One time that happened was when we where in front of the office at our school. We tickled and tickled each other till we where laughing our butts off on the flour. Well a teacher came and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we just went to our classes. Well @PERSON1 was the office aid and so when she went to the office, apparently one of the office people saw us tickling each other and thought we where going out. @PERSON1 told me that she just said ""@CAPS3"" and started to chuckle. I got a big laugh out of that. Laughter is a vary good thing to me because without it, @PERSON1 and I wouldn't be best friends as we are today in @NUM2 grade. You see, our friendship all started off of laughter. I met @PERSON1 in the sixth grade @CAPS4 class. Our teacher had assigned seats and @PERSON1 and I and two other people had to sit together. I had no idea who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing about it and soon enough she introduced her self and so did I. Well the seating arrangement changed and she sat somewhere ells and so did I. Well the person she sat by moved away. I had a bad grade in @CAPS4 class and I told my teacher I wasn't getting along with the people at my table and asked if I could sit somewhere ells. He told me yes and so I went over and asked @PERSON1 if I could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit in before he moved away. She told me that she didn't care and so then on out we started hanging in school together and had so much fun.  So you see. Laughter is a grate deal in a lot of peoples life's. You need it. Without it I would of never made my best friend who I have today. I have her to thank for getting me through my tough years. Without the laughter in this world we would be lost probably. Just think about what you might not have or what you might be missing if you didn't have laughter in your life.",17,16,33,0.55
20832,8," Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. Many times there are things that happen that make you laugh. For example; someone trips over your backpack and @CAPS7 fall @CAPS3 their face. You can't help it but laugh! Then you start feeling bad and wish you wouldn't of laughed at them for tripping, but then you start remembering how @CAPS7 fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble. Laughter is a big part of your life that their isn't at least a time of day that you don't laugh. Everybody in my family is fun and @CAPS7 always make me laugh. Their isn't a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say ""awkward silence."" We are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad. Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call ""good times."" I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family. And how embarrassment is involved. It is a beautiful sunny day @CAPS3 @DATE1. Today was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2. It was the day I was going to have my @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1 and sat down @CAPS3 a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my @PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3."" I got my hair done, did my make-up, put my dress @CAPS3, went outside to take pictures, and got @CAPS3 the limousine so I could go to church. After I went to church I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS4 to take pictures at the @ORGANIZATION3 building. After we got back from @CAPS4, I went to the @ORGANIZATION1, at @CAPS6, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name @CAPS7 ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong! The guys were supposed to spell ""@ORGANIZATION2"", with two guys wearing black @CAPS3 each end, but @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS8""! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS9""! I'm am not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could of stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end it was funny. Everybody in there started laughing and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matte if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, that we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life. Laughter is a moment of happiness.",20,18,36,0.6
20836,8,"         The @CAPS1 Of Laughter In @CAPS2 @CAPS3 me laughter is important, we all laugh in our lives. It's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough @CAPS3 listen and pay attention. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime. For my friends and I, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every moment of it. My friend @PERSON1 and I have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since. what has kept our @CAPS2 strong and still alive today, is the memories we have created through laughter. One memory I always seem @CAPS3 remember though, is the first time we had gone inner-tubing together.   There have been many memories made between @PERSON1 and I that we remember because of the laughter we shared. Yet the memory that always remains dominate, is when we had gone inner-tubing for the first time. It was our seventh grade @DATE1 and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. Now this did not really work out because I had @CAPS3 babysit a lot, but she was a good friend and understood. So when we did hang out it was always so much fun. Now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any @CAPS2. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. That @DATE1 we would hang out at each others house's and go places together. Then one day @ORGANIZATION1's parent's had decided that they wanted @CAPS3 take a trip @CAPS3 the lake and go boating. @PERSON1's family invited me @CAPS3 come along, and so I asked and I was able @CAPS3 go with their family @CAPS3 the lake. I had been boating before, and @CAPS3 the lake that we were going too. What I was not expecting, was for @PERSON1 and I @CAPS3 go inner-tubing. It was exciting, and nerve-racking all at the same time; I had never laughed so much with @LOCATION1 in my life.Going inner-tubing turned out @CAPS3 be one of the best memories we had ever made together. During the entire @DATE1 whenever possible,we had gone inner-tubing, for me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. It was our new story @CAPS3 tell everyone and we were both proud of it. When inner-tubing we had learned @CAPS3 work together and it helped our @CAPS2 a lot in a way. Also when inner-tubing we got @CAPS3 the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it.  That @DATE1 we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all @CAPS3 laughter. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. If not for laughter I do not know where my @CAPS2 with @PERSON1 would stand. And because of that, I believe that laughter is important in any relationship or @CAPS2. It's a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great.",20,20,40,0.6666666666666666
20841,8," As we understand the benefits of laughter, we realize that we cant live without it. Its one of those things that are always going to be with us through tough times, and the joy of life. So when people say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", well there right! You can think anything you want to, but i want you to know that i have the best laughter in the world when it comes to the boy i have fallen for.  It all started on a softball tournament in bend. Our team drove there for the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed in the @LOCATION2 inn hotel. Which was very nice by the way, probably to nice for our team, because we end up destroying the place like a bunch of football players in a locker room, hence the hard practices. After our practice we go ahead and swim in the pool, even know we have a big game the next day. The hotel had two big pools, one outside, and one inside with a sauna. We all go to the inside pool because in was way to cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend @PERSON3 and I go into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit. After a while two boys about our age enter the sauna while we were still in there. They acted as if they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us which was kind of awkward, no doubt. When it comes to boys I'm not shy to just speak my mind and to ask them why the hell there just sitting there pretending to mind there own business, and i know for a fact that's not why. We talk a laugh for a bit and got to know each other. One of them was extremely adorable and i hit it off with him very well. It got later into the @TIME1 and it was time for all of us to head back to our rooms and say good bye for ever. Me and @PERSON3 shared a room with her parents. I had know idea that @PERSON3 gave my number to @PERSON1, the guy i kind of liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later i get a text saying ""meet me outside to walk around"". So i amused that it was him, and i got all excited! so we snuck out of the room for the @TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk, he was barefooted and as cute as can be. I never laughed so hard in my life! He made me smile and feel like i could con-core everything that came my way.  About forty five minutes past, still gazing into each others eyes, feeling like it as only been a second. His friend @PERSON2 sees someone walking out a the hotel room and realizes that its his mom. They bolt off saying there goodbyes and at the last second he kisses me on the cheek for his farewell. Never in my life have i experienced something so exciting and fun, and most of all i understand the importance of laughter. Knowing that i would never see him again is what kills me. He lives in @CAPS1 and i live in @LOCATION1. How could anything possibly happen between us? Maybe some day i will meet him again. Maybe someday i would be able to talk to him again like we did that @TIME1, and just maybe, will i fall in love with him. All those maybe's have came true, because i fallowed what was right and i waited. Now sense that all happened i can ponder and relate to laughter and how it effected me in life. That is what brought us together, and I'm happy that all of that could happen so quick in my young life.",17,16,33,0.55
20848,8," Laughter is something everyone needs in their life. We all need some humor, and even sometimes, we need to laugh at ourselves. You need a laugh, a smile and a sense of humor to live life to it's fullest. When people take things other have said, differently, or even thinking a joke was said way too harsh, and they take it the wrong way. People told me, ""you need a sense of humor, you know?"" @CAPS1, I feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back, my sophomore year, I was going through a rough time. With friends, and family becoming more and more apart from each other. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say, through the first four to five months of sophomore year, it was hard trying to crack at a simple joke. Once, sophomore year was coming to a close, I realized there was more to life @CAPS1 moping around in my own self-pity. It was getting close to @DATE1 vacation and I know I wanted to make @DATE1, and my junior year, my year, and that no one would ruin it for me. After from being all sad and not having any fun, and laughing at the jokes my dad made about me, I know I needed to hang out with him a lot more. When my dad and I hung out, we had more laughs @CAPS1 I couldn't even remember having. It was a really good memory to have. Especially with my dad. My self-esteem was getting a lot better @CAPS1 it use to be. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I had a better relationship with my dad, too. So far, life was going great for me. I realized that I was more happy when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say, I never smiled, nor laughed as much as I did in a while. The truth about me was that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't go through any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and it was probably why I was so sad my sophomore year. When I discovered myself, I knew there was a lot more to life @CAPS1 getting a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and just appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called, and what a trans-gender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most of all; happy. I know I was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out. I got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I laughed at all of them who sent me hate mail, calls, and text messages. It was really worth the laugh, because I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know a thing about transgenders, or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived through a hot @DATE1 and now it was time for school. I was really excited for it to start, and even more excited for the sports ahead of me. I knew I was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it. When it was around my birthday, like, a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know I needed it more in my life. There was a girl that started talking to me on @CAPS2-book. She was really cute, her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would end up burning. Her name was @PERSON2, and that also fit her, everything was just so great about her. We ended up talking on the phone at twelve, in the @TIME1, on my birthday. By far, that was the best night I had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me. @PERSON2 and I hung out that weekend at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, in @LOCATION1. When we headed up there her friend, @PERSON1, was singing to the songs by @CAPS5, while @PERSON2 mocked her squeaky voice. I never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain. So, you see, having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have. You even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when they make your heart melt, and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS2 light up with a smile.",15,15,30,0.5
20856,8,"                                @CAPS4 @CAPS1 Laughter is a powerful tool when you know how to use it. It has the ability to inspire, when in doubt. Lift heavy spirts to new heights, and it can also create great devotion, to a person, thing or cause. So what has laughter done for you and I? Well it has done lots for me, a good example would be my experience in the @ORGANIZATION2.  At @CAPS2 middle @ORGANIZATION3 I had everything going for me. I had good grades, teachers, but most of all a group of friends that I could share many laughs with. When we graduated and went to @ORGANIZATION3 my friends either moved or dispersed into other groups. It was horrible not to have anyone to laugh with, making things pretty tough. Then came the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 program, or @ORGANIZATION1.  Since I wasn't really envoled in the program I didn't have any friends, save vanecek. Then an opportunity it join the @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION4 arose, I took it. Every afternoon for one hour we had practice, which in turn created a strong bond between the @ORGANIZATION4 members. Before shooting we would laugh it up and relax, making it a fun enviroment to shoot. The @ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the nickname, @CAPS4 @CAPS1, due to all the laughter heard outside the range. The @ORGANIZATION2, which my battalion as a part of, hosts five competitions a year. With fourteen schools from across @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2 competing, I got pretty nervous. Before our first competition we had been with one another long enough to consider one another family. My family, seeing how I was nervous, took me aside the night before the shoot-out. We played cards, talked and cracked jokes, it was the one of the most special times of my life. We shot early the next morning, I wasn't nervous just relaxed. Out of twenty four man teams we took third, not bad for a new famliy. Since then the @ORGANIZATION4 has taken first, four times in a row. Those victories I have to give credit to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter in a way has inspired me to devote myself to a family, and has taken me to new heights. I guess my question for you would be, what @CAPS4 @CAPS1 are you part of?",20,20,40,0.6666666666666666
20857,8," Seeing one of @CAPS15 best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door, was enough to make myself laugh. Its was the @DATE1 after @CAPS15 @NUM1 grade year of school. I was having @CAPS15 friends @PERSON2, @PERSON3 and @CAPS15 neighbor @PERSON1 stay the night at @CAPS15 house. @CAPS25 ever we got bored we usually went around @CAPS15 neighborhood ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"" some houses to have some fun. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"" is @CAPS25 @CAPS21 quietly sneak up to someones front door, ring the door bell a couple times and then @CAPS23 run away. All four of us were hanging out that day. It was a great @DATE1 day, gorgeous sun, warm temperature and a nice gentle breeze to cool off your face.@CAPS25 it came to night fall we were all in @CAPS15 room playing @CAPS7 @NUM2.  ""I'm bored bro,"" @PERSON2 said to the other three of us.  ""@CAPS8 then, think of something to @CAPS19,""@CAPS9 replied  ""I can't think of anything,"" @PERSON1 stated with a bored look on his face. We sat for a while thinking of something to @CAPS19 to entertain the four of us. ""I got it!"" I said with a confident smirk ,""lets go @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!"" "" I down for that ,""@PERSON2 said ""@CAPS13 me too ,""@CAPS9 and @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2. As we were walking out @CAPS15 front door @CAPS15 mom shouted ,""where are @CAPS21 boys going?"" @CAPS15 mom caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say ,""uh, we are going on a walk ,""I replied hesitantly.  ""@CAPS16 be safe,"" @CAPS15 mom said as I walked out of the door. We @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ditched a couple house, but that was starting to get boring and then it hit me like a typhoon. I came up with the best idea I have thought of yet.  ""@CAPS18 this is what needs to happen, I'm going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28 the first house, @PERSON2 @CAPS21 get the next one, @PERSON1 @CAPS21 get the house at the corner and @PERSON3 will run around the corner to get the last house.   ""@CAPS19 @CAPS21 think that will work?"" @PERSON1 asked.  ""@CAPS20 yes it will work!"" I said,""@CAPS21 @CAPS18 ready?""   ""I guess so ,"" @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 yes. We all lined up in place. I rang the first door bell and started running, then I saw @PERSON2 slam his clinched fist on the second door, next i didn't see @PERSON1 ring the door bell because he was already running ahead of me.  ""@CAPS9 get the last house!"" I shouted at him. The house @CAPS9 was running to did not have their porch light on. @CAPS9 was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! @CAPS9 tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street.  He got up quickly and turn to us in confusion ,""should I ring the door bell? Should I ring it?""  ""@CAPS23 run @CAPS9 I'm sure they would hear @CAPS21 smack their screen door with your face!"" @CAPS25 we got back to @CAPS15 house everyone was laughing. @CAPS9 @CAPS23 made our night. That happened @NUM3 years ago and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. So next time one of your friends ask @CAPS21 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28"" a house think about if the porch lights are on. ",18,20,36,0.6
20872,8,"Laughter is a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have been there, I know @CAPS4 have. We all have. @CAPS4 have been that kid that just did not feel like helping your nagging parent out. Especially when your dad had been in a huge motorcycle wreck and @CAPS4 had been waiting on him hand and foot the entire visit there.@CAPS10 had gone through a couple of surgeries and was put on a lot of medications for @CAPS2. I had noticed @CAPS10 was not really himself on all these pills. His abnormality was taking a toll on the family. Through all these stressful times, we were also worried about @CAPS6 stepmother. She was pregnant with her second child. There was also stress of having @CAPS6 fathers business being the main income, and him not being able to work. @CAPS6 father felt helpless, his leg was to weak for him to be doing anything.@CAPS10 would micromanage everything, and tell @CAPS4 were doing things all wrong. The was starting to cause a lot of tension within the house.  Today was the day. Isabelle (@CAPS6 little sister) and I were left alone with @CAPS6 with dad for the first time.I was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we were doing in @CAPS6 room. Father asked asked if I could make him some oatmeal, of course with full hands I said ""@CAPS5, but I will when I'm done."" @CAPS6 father took that as disrespect, and hobbled over to me with his crutches. @CAPS10 was yelling at me which was upsetting, so instead of fighting back i headed to @CAPS6 room.The anger in his voice was excruciating. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and headed back to @CAPS6 room. That's when it happened. @CAPS6 father hooked the end of a little kids chair and flung it down the hallway. It bounced off the walls, breaking an outlet shell, putting a hole in the wall, and hitting @CAPS6 knee. I didn't say anything, being afraid of what would happen next. Slamming the door luckily I had the phone and I called @CAPS6 grandmother. I told her on a voice mail that I wanted her to pick me up and take me to her house. She showed up an hour or so later not knowing I left a voice mail. I explained what happened, and she comforted @CAPS6 sister and I telling us it would be okay. @CAPS6 grandmother sat us all in the living room to try and resolve the situation. By then @CAPS6 dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. @CAPS10 used popcorn and candy to make us forgive him, then @CAPS10 started making fun, and jokes. Every time there is a fight or disagreeing @CAPS6 dad always cracks a few jokes to get us in a better mood. The one thing different this time is after @CAPS10 told some jokes, @CAPS10 apologized again. This time explaining why @CAPS10 was sorry. I liked that which made the rest of the day quite a joy.  "" @CAPS7 made laughter to be a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 medicine, @NUM1 minutes of laughter is equal to two hours of @CAPS2 @CAPS3."" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a @DATE1 service talked about this. Laughter can truly mend a broken heart. The @CAPS2 that @CAPS6 sister an I went through that day was all over after the laughter @CAPS6 father gave us. ""Laughter can save us."" @CAPS10 also stated. After this day I believe with a little humor @CAPS6 father an I's relationship can get through anything. I would never let one mistake control a life time bond. Laughter will always be in our hearts.",20,18,38,0.6333333333333333
20915,8," @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself."" @CAPS2 muttered looking away. ""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. ""@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?"" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. ""@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours,"" I said sitting down against the door. ""@CAPS29 all you find?"" @PERSON3 muttered. ""@CAPS30."" I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. ""I'm scarred, you scarred?"" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. ""@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper,"" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS20, that is true,"" @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke.

20942,8,"A @ORGANIZATION1 is a wondrous gift. It allows your mind and your body to conjoin with others. It is the root of happiness, and brings a sense of sanity to those who have lost hope. When you feel alone in the world with no one at your side, laughter will be there to accompany you. At one point in my life I felt confused and by myself. I was empty. Solitude was the only thing I could have, and the only feeling my mind would register. Just when I had thought that I @MONTH1 be the only person in the whole world, something had come to save me.  I was six years old when they got divorced. I couldn't stand to hear my parents fight. One day we were the perfect family. We would play board games and go to the movies together. Something had changed very quickly. My @CAPS1 grabbed his jacket, told me he loved me and then he was gone. Was I ever going to see him again? Why isn't @CAPS1 living with us? These are questions I kept asking myself. I think i was too young to truly know what was going on. The days were long and I found myself becoming sluggish and glum.  About two weeks after my @CAPS1 had left, some neighbors moved into the house adjacent to me and my mom. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I didn't think much of the new people in town. I told myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever, and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding my bike and thought that I should stop pedaling and crash into my fence. I hit the metal fence and simply fell over. I heard a laugh and turned around. It was the new neighbor kid. There he was rolling on the ground, grabbing at his sides. He must have thought of my crash as entertainment. I picked up my bike, began to move, then crashed once more. Another series of laughs sprang from this boy. That was the first time I had smiled in a long time. I grew fond of whatever feeling or humor I was giving off to this new kid. I asked the boy his name and he didn't respond; though he did start to laugh again. It was my voice that he was laughing at. Everything I did caused him to become hysterical. I found out later that he was from @LOCATION1 and didn't speak a word of @CAPS2. Over the course of a month or so, I felt the hole in my heart begin to fill. My new companion and his laugh was the start to my new beginning. My mom and I eventually moved out of our house and lost contact with the neighbors. I am always reminded of him when I hear a laugh. Though he's not near me in a physical sense, I am guided by his laughter every day.",20,20,40,0.6666666666666666

Laughter brings out a sense of @CAPS1 closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure @CAPS17 life would not be the same as it is @CAPS5. Without laughter, @CAPS17 @DATE1 vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over @DATE1 vacation @CAPS17 friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). This however, was not as easy as it @MONTH1 sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. @CAPS14 name it, we did it. @CAPS12 was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @CAPS17 closet friend @PERSON2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON5 bent over.  ""@CAPS3 @PERSON5,"" I began, ""@PERSON2 and I found these shorts @TIME1, and thought that @CAPS14 might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top."" ""@CAPS4! Thanks guys, they fit great!"" @PERSON5 screamed as @CAPS12 filled with excitement. ""@CAPS5 let's go to the mall!"" @CAPS6 about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw @CAPS17 phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran @CAPS6 it as it slid down the walk way. Just as @CAPS12 was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, @PERSON4 walked right behind her. Next thing @CAPS14 know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS7 face was priceless. I wish I had had @CAPS17 camera.  We had never seen @PERSON5 so mad. @CAPS12 was absolutely fuming, yet @PERSON2 and I were still @CAPS9 @CAPS10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @CAPS10 someones pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people @CAPS10 the mall?  ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11,"" @CAPS12 screamed. ""@PERSON4 saw @CAPS13, and @CAPS14're @CAPS9? He's never going to talk to @CAPS11 again. I hate @CAPS14 guys!""  ""@CAPS14 don't hate us. That was hysterical and @CAPS14 know it,"" chimed @PERSON2. ""@CAPS15 like we embarrassed @CAPS14 pretty good, huh?"" ""@CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock,"" I giggled as @PERSON2 and I gave each other a high-five. A few minutes later @PERSON5 began to crack up @CAPS9, and apologized for freaking out @CAPS6 realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, @CAPS12 was planning to get us back. By the end of @DATE1 break we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one to @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We all had a gut @CAPS1 that this was going to be the best one yet.  Everyone was having a blast @CAPS10 @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was @CAPS10 the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON5 decided to undo @CAPS17 bikini top, and pull @CAPS19 bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in @LOCATION2's room, and locked the door. How could @CAPS12 take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we wont do it again, and we @CAPS5 know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, @CAPS14 can @CAPS5 see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do @CAPS14 have any experiences @CAPS2 laughter brought @CAPS14 and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?    ",20,20,40,0.6666666666666666
20949,8,"                                  ""Laughter"" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feeling we can have, although it can hurt if its too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves, and forget about the bad in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a bore. But you never want to push laughter, because even laughter has a limit.  There is different ways to bring laughter in someones life, and there is different ways of being funny. There is good ways of being funny and bad ways. A bad way is being the class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can get you on your teachers bad side. A good way would to tell a joke or maybe sometimes embarrassing yourself can work. It seem to be the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think it was. I know that I can be funny at times, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it is never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making another feel bad can make you look bad, and others @MONTH1 not think of you as funny. You never want to put another down, people have feelings, and hurting someone only makes you look like the bad guy.   @CAPS1 people think that happiness is in fairy tales, also love, but when you really want happiness than turn to your friends and make them laugh. Getting another to laugh feels great, and it helps build up confidence and character. Having confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love, and others @MONTH1 think about you in a better way. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just appears for no reason at all.    Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being a bore can make you seem like your not an interesting person or not really all that fun. When people fall in love they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @CAPS2 you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part in life. There is many adventures that life will take you through.  I love to laugh, it makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good on the inside and out. I also love to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend @CAPS3. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going right, I knew that she wasn't happy and I didn't want her to feel like that. So as a friend I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Ever since then we've been best friends and she has never felt like that again. Laughter really is a great thing to have, it brings happiness to us all. And getting others to laugh makes you more of an interesting person, being an interesting person makes life easier and more stress free.  Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, along with sadness. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think that laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something that is just as great, is like finding a meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So go out and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good.",16,20,36,0.6
20971,8," @CAPS8 families @DATE1 in @LOCATION1 was one of exploration, but also one in which we came to regret our move from @LOCATION3 a little. We missed our friends, our connections, but also places. The place @CAPS8 brother and I came to miss second only to our farm was a @CAPS3 we had dubbed ""The @CAPS1, @CAPS1 @CAPS3."" The place itself was a dump. Close to a dairy farm, it reeked of cow pats mixed with cigarettes. I remember that the grass was perpetually dry, and the bridge crossing the @CAPS3 was continually squeaking; it was an old, covered bridge, and on its last leg. So, it wasn't so much the place we missed, but the happy memories associated with our special place. On one particularly mopey day, our father roused us from our rooms, saying that we were going to explore a new @CAPS3. We knew about @CAPS4's adventures; we called them ""@CAPS4-ventures"" because they were truly one of a kind. Most of the time, we ended up miles away from any civilization and stuck in the car with our lunch out of reach. Even at our young ages, we had come to be wary of ""@CAPS4-ventures."" @CAPS7, our mother was able to rouse @CAPS8 brother and I, and we were soon hustled into the car. During the trip, our father was unbearably cheerful. While @CAPS8 brother and I were in the back of the car, pining for our nice, comfortable rooms, @CAPS8 father had the audacity to laugh along to the radio, and open the windows of the car to our protests. Riding with @CAPS8 brother and I in the back were two circular lumps of rubber that had been inflated. I would soon learn that these were called inner tubes, and could be used to drift down the @CAPS3. After what seemed like hours on the road, we arrived at a place called ""@LOCATION2 bend."" @CAPS8 brother and I jumped out of the car, and were met with pristine beauty. Covered in shade, the @CAPS3 flowed noisily, and we could hear it although we were not that close to the @CAPS3 bank. The grass was green and velvety beneath our feet, and the smell of fresh water welling up from the earth was delicious. The light filtered down through the trees and had a crystalline effect on the water. @CAPS8 brother and I hurriedly dressed into our swimsuits, while @CAPS8 father began to cart our food and supplies down the the @CAPS3 bank where we would be spending the day. As soon as we finished dressing, @CAPS8 brother and I chased after him, for the day was warm and the water looked good and cool. When our hunger had been sated, it was time to pull out the inner tubes. The water was nice and fast, with some white water and a very little water fall at the end. Being a rather petite child for @CAPS8 age, even these small obstacles looked like the most insidious of rapids, and they made @CAPS8 eyes widen a little. @CAPS7, I managed to steady myself, and prepared to get wet. At @DATE1, I hung on to @CAPS8 inner tube with clutched fingers and wild eyes, but gradually, I relaxed. I let @CAPS8 hand drift out to causally trail behind me in the water, drawing circles as the sunlight filtered down through the trees. As the water grew faster, I began to feel apprehensive again. I drew sharp, quick breaths as the little waterfall approached me. In reality, it was only about four feet tall, but in @CAPS8 panicked haze, those four feet looked like twelve feet. The white water was suddenly upon me, accompanied by a large and frightful shriek I gave. Somehow, I managed to stay afloat, and @CAPS8 ride left me smiling. I broke into long peals of laughter, laughing away all @CAPS8 homesickness and heartsickness. @CAPS8 brother came down the waterfall, spluttering and giggling, and we laughed together. Our laughter healed us, and for the @DATE1 time since the move, we felt totally and completely at home.",21,25,46,0.7666666666666667

One @ORGANIZATION1 we were out at @CAPS3 great grandpas house, and we just got done opening our presents, and in the middle of the floor was a @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 cousin @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was inside the @CAPS2.   At first we tried to convince @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was out side talking to @CAPS3 uncle. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't believe us, even though @CAPS3 dad was outside talking. @ORGANIZATION2 circled the @CAPS2, and observed the @CAPS2 and was convinced @CAPS3 dad was in it.  Then @ORGANIZATION2 started poking the @CAPS2. We were laughing because it was so cute that @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was in the @CAPS2. He kept saying ""I know he is in there."" @ORGANIZATION2 opened the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad was not in there. @CAPS3 dad walked in to the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story and he started laughing too. Later on in the @TIME1 @ORGANIZATION2 was playing in the other room and wanted to show @CAPS3 dad the toy he was playing with. So @CAPS3 dad climbed in the @CAPS2 and we told @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was outside. @ORGANIZATION2 went outside to look for him but @CAPS3 dad wasn't there.   When @ORGANIZATION2 came inside he looked in every room and could not find @CAPS3 dad. After a while @ORGANIZATION2 was standing by the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad jumped out and scared @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 screamed like a little girl and we all laughed really hard.   @ORGANIZATION2 was mad at first then he started laughing too. At the time @ORGANIZATION2 was only five so when @CAPS3 dad jumped out at him he got really scared. @ORGANIZATION2 thought it would be funny to scare @CAPS3 dad so @ORGANIZATION2 hid in the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad came inside and we told @CAPS3 dad to look for @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3 dad called his name looked in every room and pretended like he couldn't find @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing because @CAPS3 dad acted like he was going to sit on @ORGANIZATION2 and it made him laugh super hard. When @ORGANIZATION2 got out of the @CAPS2 he was like ""how did you know I was in the @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 dad said ""well you started laughing silly goose.""   out of all the @ORGANIZATION1's i have had that @ORGANIZATION1 was the best @ORGANIZATION1 ever.

20994,8,"                                         The @CAPS1 of Laughter  Many people think it is love that brings people together. But love is something that develops over time and brings people closer in the long run. Before you've ever loved someone though, you've laughed with them. Laughter creates conversation, mends relationships, and brings joy to people. Its an important part of any relationship and has certainly helped me make friends.   In the kindergarten, everything was new to me. I got to leave my house, go to school, eat lunch, and go to recess. There were many children just like me, bouncing with excitement as our daily routine started. Although we played together at school, at home there was no one around to play with.   One day after school, I noticed a boy walking around next to my yard. I walked over and remembered him from that school day in my classroom.  ""@CAPS2"", was all I said. He turned around, and with all his might, burped as loud as he could. We fell into a fit of laughter and I knew I'd made a new friend that day. From then on, him and I were bestfriends. Any adventure that happened after school always ended with us laughing about something. There was no need for our parents to set up any ""playdates"" or scheduled time to meet other children because it was easier to laugh at something and make a friend naturally, not awkwardly while the parents chatted. From then on, making friends was a piece of cake.Through grade school and well into my teenage years, I had a best friend and a lot more friends, solely, because of a moment of laughter.  Laughing is something that can always ""break the ice"". Whenever you meet someone new, it's always kind of hard to just talk to them. You don't know whether to be serious, outgoing, funny, or quiet. But if something happens that makes both of you laugh, then it becomes easier to communicate because that laughter eases some of the tension in between. It's like riding a bike, after the initial awkwardness, things just get easier and easier.  For many, laughter helps heal pain. Tragic things happen in every persons life and it can be hard to deal with at times. Whether it's a breakup, a depressive mood, or maybe even a death of a loved one, something funny and a laugh @MONTH1 help them get their mind off of whatever is bothering them. Most of them time that's all a person wants, something to help them forget what ever troubles them, if only for a few minutes. It's how people build better relationships, they do whatever they can for each other to make each other feel better.   Besides it's healing and conversation starting qualities, laughing is simply fun to do. It @MONTH1 start out as a small giggle, turn into a chuckle, and end up as a fifteen minute session of raging, side cramping laughter. And most of the time, you're with friends so they're enjoying the moment of fun and happiness right along with you.   If you've never laughed once in your life, there's something wrong. It will eliminate awkward moments, relieve painful thoughts or feelings, and create instant fun. Just try it, it's not that hard. I guarantee that it will bring you closer to someone, make life less stressful, and make you happy.",20,20,40,0.6666666666666666

21013,8,I think that laughter is very important. It is very important to me because let's say that a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think its funny it's going to hurt that student. I think that instead of laughing at someone that you could be a good kid and ask him if he is ok and help him up. That shows that student that he really has a friend that cares about him alot and doesn't laugh at him and really cares about his best friend. You also can get rewarded for doing something good but to me it's really not about what I get it's the things i do to help out my peer's . I think that we should not laugh and have a positive attitude and be mature about what we do and what we say and reacact to things like laughing at someone else. I also think that if I would have fell and I got really hurt and kids would start laughing at me so thats what I learn respect the students the way that you want to be respected. So I wouldnt like people to make fun of me so why would I like to make fun of someone else if I wouldnt want them to make fun of me thats why you should treat your peers with respect.,10,17,24,0.4
21026,8,"               Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and stairing, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselfs, we didnt care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and the facial exspressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Becasue I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON2 and I were walking back home from @PERSON1 we were dreding the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't stairing at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remebered this voice my god brother @CAPS2 that was like @CAPS3 compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON2 started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON2 was this tall thin girl that was my bestfriend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didnt mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier then that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself i thought""@CAPS4, that seemed like two minutes just to get home.""I knew that if @PERSON2 and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us,""@CAPS5 were you guys dancing while you were waling down the @NUM1 and I just looked at eachother and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun. All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together. Doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know eachother more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there. ",17,15,32,0.5333333333333333

Every two years or so, the choir at my @ORGANIZATION1 has an opportunity to go on a trip together. During these trips, the students are able to work with college professors, eat tons of junk food, get away from their parents, and just have a great time together. It's a experience that every @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 dreams of. At the beginning of my @CAPS3 year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, my choir director announced that we would have the opportunity to go to @LOCATION2. I was ecstatic to be going, but I'm an extremely introverted person and I knew that I didn't really have any friends in the choir. I also can't walk, and was scared I would be left behind in a store because I couldn't open the doors or they would go across a street corner that didn't have a @CAPS5 dip down into the street, and thousands of other things that were racing through my mind. I was so terrified that that I would be separated from @PERSON3, my one friend who was in choir, that I almost didn't go. I'm not really sure how, but my mother convinced me that everything would be alright, and I had nothing to fear. Once we arrived in @LOCATION2, we split up into groups to see who wanted to go to explore the @PERSON7 and who wanted to go up @ORGANIZATION2 street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare came true, I was separated from @LOCATION3. I tried to tell myself that nothing would go wrong and that the chaperons wouldn't leave me behind, but in the back of my mind I just kept coming to the same conclusion: I would be alone with a bunch of strangers in a city I knew nothing about. Somehow, I got on the bus that was slowly taking me away from @LOCATION3. One of the other girls, @PERSON4, came to sit by me, and attempted to start a conversation. That was one of the longest bus rides of my life. When we arrived at the bottom of @ORGANIZATION2 street we split yet again, one group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill and the other was going to ride in one of the old trolleys up to the top then walk down where the hill wasn't as steep. I was forced to go on the trolley because the hill was so steep part of the sidewalk contained steps, and since I can't walk, the only alternative was the trolly. Several of the other kids went with us and once again @PERSON4 was in my group. A couple hours later, after getting lost and turning on several wrong streets, we found the trolley station and bought our tickets. Luckily, I managed to avoid conversing with @PERSON4 this whole time, so the ride up the hill was enjoyable. Some of the local people smiled at us because we were so excited to be riding on the trolley. We saw houses, stores, and @LOCATION1 on our ride.  There were six people in our group at the time, two chaperons and four kids. Once we reached the top of the hill, two of the kids, @PERSON6 and @PERSON5, decided they really had to go to the bathroom, so one of the chaperons, @PERSON6, and @PERSON5 raced back down the hill to find a public restroom. This left me, alone, with @PERSON4 and @PERSON1, who was the remaining chaperon. We walked leasiurly down the hill, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 doing most of the talking. Every so often they would ask me a question and I would answer in as few words as possible, and that's what was going on when we walked past a group of men, arguing, in front of a store and one of them yelled, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5 @CAPS6! Whatcha doing? You goin' to your @CAPS7's house?"" We didn't really know who he was talking to, or what he was talking about, so we just kept walking, but as we reached the end of the block @PERSON4 and I simultaneously broke into laughter. The man was talking about me. The rest of the way down the hill we started coming up with different weird responses that I should have said to the man, each one being more hilarious than the last one, and as conversations go, we eventually got on different topics, which made me realize that @PERSON4 and I really did have many similar traits. We both loved musicals, we both enjoy reading, and we both have annoying, younger brothers. Ever since that day, @PERSON4 and I have been fairly good friends, all because we took a moment to laughed together.",20,20,40,0.6666666666666666
21051,8," One of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @CAPS1 what I see most is laughing. There is that laugh you do when you don't really understand your bosses joke and then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the ""right time."" @CAPS1 one of my favorite is laughing at your best friend when your crying. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. Quietly turning over my shoulder I try to hear more of the story. Her friend nodded and comfort her. @CAPS1 then said something about how gross it was when he ate. Sort of like a cow eating grass. As soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter. @CAPS1 still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @CAPS1 a slow smile washed over her face. The woman had more of giggle then a laugh. @CAPS1 you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember life is more then just a guy. I thought for a second how this happens more then you think with my best friend. I feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing. Most of the time it's something stupid and we are just strangely thinking the same thing. @CAPS1 then there's other times where it will be like the lady's behind me. One of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the medicine to any problem.  After watching the two woman I turn in front of me seeing now a teenage boy and girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out. Then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down. And you can tell he's trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. She nodded her head and they got silent again. The train came to it's next stop jerking a little making the boy spill some of his water on his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse giving them to the boy. His cheeks flushed with red as he started to chuckle and explaining how nervous he was and this wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. Then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. The boys laugh was deep and echoed across the train the girls was contagious @CAPS1 sweet. Now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing. This was the start of could maybe be even young love. I smiled and rested my head on the window. Watching the trees blur by. I knew how our world is always talked about being so melancholy @CAPS1 I think people forget moments like this. It's those brief seconds with another human relating to you. Making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane.  The train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. I slouch my bag on to my shoulder and get off the train. As I step outside I feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. I looked around see people hurry by me looking for their next bus or person to pick them up. I sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me. As they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark. I throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands. I snap around to see the person who had blinded me. It was my dad smiling ear to ear. I stood up on the bench and hugged him as I started to laugh. My laugh was high pitched @CAPS1 muffled in my dads coat. This was the best type of laugh to me. No action was funny or a friend saying something @CAPS1 because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any reason @CAPS1 because your happy. And then in that second everything bad or what you stressed about goes away. Maybe just for a little awhile @CAPS1 it's still something that could make your whole day better.",27,18,42,0.7
21059,8," Laughter is one of the most important elements in one's life. If you're down, one smile, or laugh, causes your body to send messages throughout you body making you feel better. Scientists also say that it takes more muscles to frown than smile. I believe that this is true, because in order to frown, you have to make your whole body look like it's frowning, like your shoulders and your face, but only a little smile shows people that you're happy. In that way, my family is extremely beneficial to each other. Everyday when we're having a conversation, someone will bring up a story, or movie quote that they were reminded of and say it out loud to everybody with just the right accent so that it sounds exactly like the movie, and cause everyone to laugh. For example, every now and again, my brother or sister will bring up a quote from @PERSON1 or @PERSON2, two comedians we really enjoy listening to, and every person in the room would pitch in with hilarious quotes they said and this could go on all night. Or, a little while ago, my favorite movie wasGet @CAPS1 because it was quite entertaining, so we would have rampages over supper or just randomly in the kitchen quoting that one movie for at least half an hour and the room would be filled with non-stop laughter. On the other hand, someone will make a random comment because they heard wrong, or just don't understand. Like when we were having a dinner party at my house. My family and our guests were sitting at the table just finished eating when we got onto the topic of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because my little sister was learning about them in school. We verbally completed the train of ""Which @CAPS4 ruled @CAPS5, who they came from, and @CAPS5 they're other names were"". But according to my little sister, we missed one. So, out of the blue comes ""@CAPS5 about @CAPS6?!"". Her intentions were about the @CAPS4, but I believe everyone in the room heard ""@CAPS5 about @CAPS9 @CAPS10?!"", until we paused for a second and processed @CAPS5 she meant, and we all laughed and she had no idea why until she stopped to think about it herself. Our family has good times filled with laughter and jokes, but there are also a few very depressing times. About four years ago, an incident happened with my next door neighbor that caused him to be brutally attacked and pass away on our door step. He was very dear to my family and the rest of the cul-de-sac we live in, and for him to die like that was extremely unexpected and terrible to wake up to in the middle of night. After that, there was a period of not very much laughter and fun because we were all haunted by this horror. But, we all knew that his spirit was there to protect us, and so whenever we thought of that, there was a gap between the mourning of his loss, only to be filled in with happiness and laughter. I believe that my family and I have a really tight connection between each other, because we're so funny. There's never any stress between us, but always a calm sense of familiarity and bonding. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I believe that, whoever that person is, is right. Even between two strangers that run into each other on the street, if they stop and have a conversation, and one person cracks a joke causing them both to laugh, it's the spark to an immediate connection, and they could become friends for a long time. This is one of the most important values that people have, and most people overlook how much it really matters to humanity.",20,25,45,0.75
21078,8," We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter can show emotions, but can also go to the distance of strengthening a friendship, or relationship. To many people laughter is a very important part of any relationship.  First, Laughter is very important in a friendship. If you cant have a fun happy friendship then you wont have a good friendship. Building up to a friendship is always sometimes difficult. It can take up to a good laugh, to not laughing at all to determine your friendship. Having a friendship with someone is one of the best feelings. Knowing that you have someone you can trust, talk to, be there for you, and the most important laugh with is a great feeling.  Also, laughter is important in every childhood memories. Thinking back to when i was little i was always laughing. Even though my mom and dad left me and my brothers i always had my grandparents, brothers, cousins, even aunt and uncles to keep my busy and always have a good time. I think laughter is an important thing being a child because its healthy, you can learn to keep others spirits high and keep others laughing and happy, . and its always good to have a strong, fun, happy relationship with your family.  Last, laughter is very important in a relationship. I think it will build character to your relationship and shows everyone that your happy with the person that your with. Laughter will also build a good and strong healthy relationship and will lead to good things. If you think about it laughter is probably the most important in a relationship because when you decide to marry the person your with it will lead to not getting a divorce and fighting and you will have a strong relationship.  So, therefore after pointing out that laughter is important no matter what age, what gender, friendship, childhood, or relationship you should see that my point is that laughter is important no matter the situation. It helps build a strong person and also builds character to yourself.",15,20,35,0.5833333333333334
21090,8,"The @CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 friends and I, always find some way to make each other laugh and have a good time. @CAPS2 friends, @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, yet completely different. Both are active, humorous girls. You could almost say they are sisters from how close their personalities match, but it's their appearance that show's otherwise. @PERSON2 is tall and skinny, with short, black, curly hair. Her clear skin has a tint of olive green. Her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes. @CAPS2 other friend, @LOCATION1, has sunshine glowing from her hair. Each golden curl ends at her belly button. The freckles, that lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her perky cheeks. Her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean. You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue.  One @DATE1 @TIME1, while the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 girls and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance. After a night of practice, I gave up and laid on the full cushion couch, that comfort every part of @CAPS2 body. Two hours fly by and the girls got it. They both had each leg steps and every movement just like @PERSON1. They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's back-up dancers. After a moment of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and stopped. @ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance once more, but with the camera recording. Minutes after pressuring @PERSON2, I started the music and pressed the record button.  The girls were doing great, but started forgetting some of the steps. Out of nowhere, both girls, full speed, run into each other. It was silent, except for the music playing. Each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter. @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, get up, crying from laughing and apologize to each other. All of this happened with me recording. After settling down, we watched the most amazing home video.  Remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful I am for @CAPS2 friends. It makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together. Without them I would not know what laughter is.",18,19,37,0.6166666666666667
21107,8," Laughter is an essential component to any relationship, as it can erase any previous uneasy feelings and has a tendency to bring two people together. This phenomenon stays true whether the individuals involved are in the same room, talking over the telephone, or even communicating over the internet. My best friend and I share a special bond in which laughing has played a large role in keeping us together.  Laughter can keep people together even in times of hardship. My best friend, @LOCATION1, is @CAPS1, and we have shared many laughs over the @DATE1 years we have been friends. We first met while playing an online computer game and immediately enjoyed each others comments and comical statements. We would immediately burst into laughter when one of us would say something that could be considered even the slightest bit funny. He and I shared many laughs over the next two and a half years. Recently his family had financial troubles and was not able to pay the internet and phone bills for several months. Work during this time seemed to be more of a burden than usual, as I had few people I could truly relax and have a laugh. Only the occasional laugh with my friends who live locally could cause me to forget the disappointment I had from missing one of my greatest friends. @DATE1 weeks ago there seemed to be some hope that my best friend and I would be again able to communicate as before. While staying up @TIME1 one @TIME1 doing homework, I noticed that I had received a message from the long-lost @LOCATION1. I immediately chuckled inside, thinking of the good times we had shared just a month earlier. To my disappointment, the message which I received was not to tell me that he had internet at his house once again, but to thank me for the @CAPS2 gift and to tell me he was at another friends house for the @TIME1. He also mentioned that he would enjoy playing a game or two with me during this time. While this provided some comfort, it did not fully satisfy my hunger for laughter because his computer which he had taken with him was missing the drivers which allowed the use of a microphone. That afternoon, though somewhat disappointing, reminded me of the many great times we had shared together. One @DATE1 ago, my hopes were finally confirmed when @LOCATION1 messaged me to tell me that he had internet again. Though we had missed being together during the @DATE1 break, we were thrilled to once again be able to communicate. I am glad the @TIME1 he chose to get internet was a @DATE2, because we played and laughed till @TIME1. The laughter which we shared that @TIME1 washed the disappointment far from both our minds. My days are once again complete, as they are now an almost perfect balance of work and laughter. Laughter truly does bring people together, far more than I had previously realized. Though my best friend and I are thousands of miles apart, when we talk and laugh together, it seems as though he is in the same room with me. I hope that some day soon we @MONTH1 be able to actually be in the same room, sharing laughs and enjoying life. This example is just one of the many where laughter has greatly improved the outcome of a particular situation, making the individuals involved even closer together than they had been before.",20,20,40,0.6666666666666666
21120,8," When I think of laughter, I think back to the wonder years. Although the memories are foggy, i can still recall the times where I believed friendship had no end and that laughter was the common cure to every battle. Thinking back to the @DATE2 I was twelve, I remember @CAPS7 adventures pushing me upward towards the sky. Free spirited and lacking reality, I was an unstoppable soul. I was @CAPS2 alone though. Through adventures and explorations, I brought @CAPS7 trustworthy opponent. Her name was @PERSON1 and she was @CAPS7 best friend.  @PERSON1 lived out in the country, where the grass grew tall and the land came in acres. Through forests and streams, you could find our hideaway from the world; We called @CAPS3 our wonderland. Now, the small stream with a bridge is nothing but a forgotten place. On a typical @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE3, I drove up to @PERSON2 to @PERSON1's house. Walking in her front door, I automatically smelled fresh cinnamon scones drizzled with honey. The sweet smell sent shivers up @CAPS7 spine. @PERSON1 came down the stairs and greeted me with a hug. She wore her long, dark hair in braids and was wearing a white sundress. Her brown, shimmering skin glittered against the sunlight and her dark brown eyes sent me a happy glare. I envied her with @CAPS7 heart and soul. Next to her, i was just the simple, blond girl with a blotchy skin tone. In one moment, she fled to the window and looked out at the perfect, blue ski. ""@CAPS1 wow, finally @DATE2 has come along,"" she whispered and then exploded,"" @CAPS2 another day spent with grumpy, sleepless peers and no more stuffy classrooms or annoying teachers. @CAPS6.. its the first day of many!"" We burst into laughter as I made fun of her poetic outburst, but we both new every word of @CAPS3 was true. Sighing, I looked at her breathtaking, dress one last time and ran out to the field in her backyard. @PERSON1 grabbed a red cardigan and followed me, holding a basket in her hand as if she were little red riding hood.  I frolicked through the meadow like I was a radiant fox chasing after its pray. When I stopped for breath, i encountered the wind blowing the tall, wispy grass in rhythmic motions around me. Racing towards our secret place, I looked back only once to to find @PERSON1. As I turned towards @CAPS7 destination again, a branch met @CAPS7 vision and knocked me down painfully. Blood trickled down @CAPS7 chin and left crimson droplets of blood in the green grass. I breathed in, choking on the salty fluid and then realized she was standing there. Like a worried hare, @PERSON1 sprang to @CAPS7 side and helped me to the house. We made our way into the upstairs bathroom.   Standing at her bathroom sink, I wept small tears. In the mirror I could see a belligerent looking girl with a bloody slash across her chin and red, misted eyes. The pain was @CAPS2 @CAPS4 made me cry; @CAPS3 was @CAPS7 appearance that had me down. People would asked for days ""@CAPS4 is on your face"" and ""@CAPS5! How did that @NUM1 came to @CAPS7 side and squeaked, ""@CAPS6, how are you?""@CAPS7 face turned to a bright shade of red in a way that I might explode. I turned to @PERSON1 and in one fluid breath I burst out, ""@CAPS8! Wonderful! Ecstatic! Before this, I had a boring, simple look going. Now, I will look even worse with this terrible blemish! I hate how gorgeous you are @PERSON1. You are exotic, distinguished and everything about you seems extremely, perfect!""@CAPS7 friend just stood there and took in every word. A confused look came across her face but slowly turned to a crooked grin. Suddenly, @PERSON1 burst out into laughter. Embarrassed, I walked to the door wanting to leave that very second, but she grew silent and look hold of @CAPS7 arm. Shaking her off, I continued down the stairs. ""@CAPS10,"" she called out to me, "" I'm @CAPS2 agreeing with you in anyway. @CAPS6, you @MONTH1 have a small cut across your chin, but you have always been beautiful and I feel like a simple, field mouse next to you. The way your blond, thin hair becomes perfect ringlets and the way your freckles highlight your amazing, turquoise eyes. I have always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing!"" I took this in for a second and then erupted into laughter. Racing up the stairs, I came to her with a big, bear hug and laughed some more. Everything I had ever thought about her beauty and mine, wasn't at all relevant. Having thought this, the pain of @CAPS7 cut became apparent to me. Lee, her dad, fixed me up with his sewing skills and each stitch, I laughed along with @PERSON1 to get through the pain. Seven stitches and a nasty scar, remind me everyday that laughter gets you through the worst while @CAPS3 builds an everlasting, friendship.     ",25,25,50,0.8333333333333334
21189,8," Building the @CAPS1 with Laughter @CAPS2 a very early age my uncle would bring the funniest cards to mine and my brothers birthdays, just to see our reaction. Then when my uncle moved to the west coast, near us, we would piss each other off just see each others reaction. We have always known when each other is having a bad day and when to lift them up when they are down.  When my family and I would go back to @CAPS3 at an early age, we would always celebrate each others birthdays with our uncle. He would bring the funniest cards to give us and we would sit there and laugh about them for hours. Then when he moved to @LOCATION1 my older brother, @PERSON1, and I started to get him funny cards to see who had the best one. We got each other cards that had sexual humor to gross humor. We would come to each others birthdays with a grin, @CAPS2 one ear to the other, waiting for the person to open up the card. One year, for his birthday, I got him a card that had some older ladies on it and had some sexual humor towards it. Lets just say nobody has beaten that card. My uncle and I work in the same building but doing way different jobs. He is the sales manager and I put the items together for him to sell. When I walk into work, I always pass by him to see how he is doing. For the most part, he is either laughing or pissed off about something in his day. On days that he is upset and walks outside to make a label for @ORGANIZATION1, I start to make fun of him right away. Sometimes he gets even more angry. But when he does, he always seems to laugh after the fact, or come back at me with a rude remark. Everyday this happens and it always seems to brighten up our days.  We bought two season passes to @CAPS4.Hood this year. At first I wasn't very good at skiing, and would always fall. When I would fall, he would board down to me while laughing and I would get very upset. We would laugh on the way home talking about how I would always fall. But as time went on, I slowly got better than him and would be waiting for him at the bottom of the run. One time, when we went up, he just couldn't seem to stay on his board and would fall non-stop. This was the time when I could finally get him back for all the times when he laughed at me for not being able to stay on my skis. I never laughed so hard in my life on that ride home. Coming down and making remarks at him about not being able to stay on his board was one of the most warming things I have ever felt. It wasn't warming for me to make rude remarks. It was warming to me, to see that he couldn't say anything back, because his time finally came to be made fun of.  My uncle and I have the relationship we do today, because of his impact on me at an early age. Him being able to make me laugh at his jokes and knowing when to brighten up my day has been one of the best things that has happened to me to date. Changing my life for the best and changing my personality for the best. These laughing experiences have turned our ""uncle-nephew"" relationship into a friend relationship. My life is full of laughter and will be full of laughter for my life because of one person.",19,18,37,0.6166666666666667
21192,8,      Have you ever laughed so hard that you peed?That @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not have happened to me. In my story I'm going to talk about the funniest time I have ever had with my best friend @CAPS1.       How it all started was that it was my best friends birthday and she was going to spend the night at her grandmas house. She invite only me to come with her so I couldn't say no. @CAPS1's grandma owned a @CAPS2 @CAPS3. She was old and was in a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club. I don't know about you but it always seems to me that old people have to be in some kinda of club. So anyways in her her club what the did was go on trips. @CAPS1 and I thought that would be fun to go on a trip. So we meant everyone at @ORGANIZATION1.         @CAPS1's grandma let us go intro the store to buy drinks for that trip. I wanted @CAPS4. The bottle was really cool. It had a top like a water bottle would have. I got the red kind cause it the best. We got are drinks and @CAPS1's grandma said to go to the car while she talked to the adults about the trip.      So here is the funny part of the story. I got into the car first. I was pretty thirsty so I decided to unscrew the cap it pulled open to paper back on the sell. I twisted the cap back on and took a drink. Mean while @CAPS1 got into the car and closed the door behind her cause her grandma was talking to the adults. While she was closing it she got her hair caught in the door. She was laughing and yelling at me to come help her. I was laughing too hard to come help her. I had my drink between my legs and the cap was open and remember its like a water bottle cap. I laughed so hard that I squeezed my legs together and my juice went straight into the front seat. It didn't get and were else just into her grandma seat. It was like a rocket it was so funny. @CAPS1 with her head still stuck in the door asked what that notice was on the seat. I told her it was my juice. Then was both started laughing.         I don't know why but @CAPS1 just pulled on her head and her head was no longer stuck. The was like ten pieces of her hair stuck in the car door. She looked at the seat and said we have to tell her grandma about it. I didn't want her to be mad at me cause her seats were white. I thought it would stain. But we ended up telling her. She told us to go get napkins from the bathroom. The whole time we were going to the bath room me and @CAPS1 were just laughing so hard. We cleaned up the mess and I didn't get in trouble.         I guess that I have never peed my pants laughing but I almost did that day. After that day me and my best friend @CAPS1 always laugh at that story. I am so glad we went on an old people @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club trip.                       ,15,20,35,0.5833333333333334
21193,8," For a year and two months I'd devoted my life to horses, school, and @CAPS1. We started off as friends in @CAPS2 grade, and it escalated to a relationship in @LOCATION1 grade. We ended up breaking up later on that year, but we continued to remain 'friends'. Obviously I still cared for @CAPS1, but I didn't believe he'd felt the same. But apparently I was wrong, we began a new relationship on @DATE1 at @NUM1 pm.    It was the perfect start to our 'perfect relationship'. He and I were inseperable from the get go, we literally did everything together. I was @PERCENT1 irrevocably in love with @CAPS1. Between the two of us, we shared some crazy memories and inside jokes. I could probably write a best selling novel of all the memories we had, and I honestly believed that @CAPS1 and I were going to be together forever. I thought everythign was going fine, till he had to lay it out, he liked someone else.   At that point, I had no idea where our relationship (or I) stood. I didn't want to know. I couldnt keep putting my heart in the open if it was going to get stomped on, but I loved @CAPS1 and was willing to do anything to make it work. I stayed the night with @CAPS1, and we talked till @NUM2. He and I decided to attempt to make it work, but there was no guarantee it was going to.     The next day, everything seemed fine. I was still extremely irritated that he liked another girl, but I was using all my power to make the best of what we had. We decidded to take his dog, @CAPS3, on a walk. We held hands as we walked, but it was too quiet. Why? He was texting @CAPS4. By that time, I decided that was the final straw. It felt like I was getting in the way, so I felt that the only choice I had left was to leave @CAPS1.  I walked in the door an hour later absolutely devistated. I cried till I felt I couldn't cry anymore, and then I would cry more. At the time, I truly felt that the world was ending right before me. My life was over. My days became long and depressing, and I felt that all I could do was give up. My heart shattered everytime I saw @CAPS1, and it made it even worse when people constantly asked about what had happened. I couldn't tell them, it wasn't a moment I would want to relive. I couldn't stop thinking about @CAPS1, and about all the memories we'd shared. That year and two months has been the greatest period of my life.   Almost everytime I thought about @CAPS1 I would cry. I couldn't stand the thought of not having @CAPS1, and thinking about @CAPS1 all the time made me into a walking zombie. I couldn't eat, I couldn't drink, and I would vomit because of the stress. But as I sat there in alone thinking of the memories, a miracle happened: I laughed. I was shocked, but it made me realize that I needed to keep living. I don't regret any of the time I spent with @CAPS1, he changed my life. He taught me so much about loving someone. I knew from that small laugh, that things were going to get better. A spark of hope, I would be happy again. ",15,20,40,0.6666666666666666
21194,8," The word (laughter) @MONTH1 mean a smile or something nice that has happened to someone or even a thank you, but for many people it means the action or sound of laughing. For many people the felling they get inside when they laugh is the felling of happiness. The sense of felling good inside is the meaning that ones in while you have to be happy in life; have a balance in your life. For me the word (laughter) means being happy and the felling of doing something good in life. For instance when a couple get married they need a sense of laughter in there life's so they can enjoy their companies. It was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2 early in the morning I was extremely exited to leave because that was the day I was going to go visit my grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, uncle, and cousins that I had not seen for about eight years. I remember that morning I felt a sense of happiness and sadness at the same time.I was about to leave for two months in a half I was going to miss my family and friends, but at the same time I felt happy and exited to go. That morning we arrived at the air port; I was about to ride on my very first airplane. As I tried to find my seat through the big line of people that were finding their seats as well; I sat down and buckled my self into the seat and looked out the window and all over the place. My stomach was turning in circles round and round and I had the felling of a roller coaster about to take off really fast. The next thing I knew the plane was moving I got kinda of scared, but at the same time I was excited.  During the flight I felt a sense of laughter in my soul; the memories of a childhood in @LOCATION2 were turning my emotions into laughter and tears that made me fell good I had never felt. The idea of seeing all my family and friend was captivate to my hear and emotions. As we arrived at the @LOCATION1 airport; my emotions were turning in circles back and forth. We only had two more flights left to get to our destinations. I was getting tired and sleepy, my legs and arm's hurt so bad, they felt like if you were caring two big bags of potatoes on each side of my leg and arms . We decided go eat some place as we walked around to see what we could find to eat we found pizza huts. The next thing I knew was that we had only one hour our to the next flight, so we agreed to head to our next flight. As we arrived to the gate people were already going in through the hallway to get into the plane so we hurried. Three hours past buy and we had landed in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 that was our destination. I felt a sense of laughter inside of me as we waited for our ride home; the feeling I got was as if someone had token something from me and gave it back. I started to cry at that moment, but at the same time I was laughing. We arrived that late afternoon to my grandparents house, as I looked at them I felt a happy inside, they were happy as well. we decided to spend the @TIME1 over at my grandparents house, that @TIME1 nobody had gone to sleep every one was to busy talking with each other and catching up. The next day every one was tired and sleepy, but they were all happy and full of laughter inside.  We had spent a mouth in a half with family members that I had not seen in a while we all felt happy and with a sense of laughter inside. Everyone had an incredible time catching up with family and friend. We did not get to do all the things we wanted to, but the best part was the time I has with my family and friends. The word laughter to me mean the best thing that has happens to you and makes you fell good inside, or even the memories you think about when you are alone and sad, those are the memories that will make you laugh and fell good about yourself. Other people @MONTH1 say that laughter is the felling you get when you laugh, but laughter is the best felling in the world when you are happy. In this part of my life laughter was an important element of my whole life and it still is a great part in my life. Over many generations people have used the benefits of laughter in their life's for instance many famous and non- famous people, important people or non- important. Many people say that when you are not happy you are going to die not knowing what happy is. People really enjoy those moments that they spend with a special someone.",22,20,42,0.7
21209,8,"Fishing trip gone wrong @CAPS1 me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of @CAPS7 life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @CAPS7 dad and brother to go fishing. @CAPS7 dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light @CAPS18 the ground. Well as I grew older so did @CAPS7 fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned @MONEY1 @CAPS7 pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for @CAPS7 fishing needs anymore. So @CAPS18 the day of @CAPS7 tenth birthday @CAPS7 family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. So after @CAPS7 birthday I had acquired one hundred and @MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night @CAPS7 dad came up to me and told me that @CAPS7 cousins wedding was this @DATE1 and that we might have time after to @CAPS15 a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed @CAPS7 tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the @CAPS7 cousins wedding @CAPS7 dad said ""@CAPS6 go fishing."" @CAPS7 dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked ""@CAPS8 dad we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 quickly"". It turned out that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS18 the way. We pulled into the @ORGANIZATION1 parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole siting @CAPS18 the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy @MONEY1. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with @CAPS7 new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. @CAPS7 dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out @CAPS7 new pole and tackle box and started to setup @CAPS7 pole for river fishing. I put @CAPS18 one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into @CAPS7 big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. ""I think the fish will love this."" I say aloud to @CAPS7 dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss @CAPS7 baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, @CAPS7 dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting @CAPS7 pole down rather softly I look upon @CAPS7 dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well @CAPS18 our walk down to river there was this @CAPS13 @CAPS14 outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to @CAPS7 right and said to @CAPS7 dad ""@CAPS15 not lose @CAPS7 fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish @CAPS18."" @CAPS7 dad reply's ""@CAPS17, @CAPS17 just go to the bathroom already."" @CAPS18 @CAPS7 walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big @CAPS19 that had landed near @CAPS7 fishing line. @CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to @CAPS7 line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom @CAPS7 dad goes running and waving his arms at the @CAPS19. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you @MONTH1 ask? It was @CAPS7 brand new fishing pole! It was at least @NUM1 maybe @NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as @CAPS7 pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land @CAPS18 shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile ""That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly."" I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS7 dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done @CAPS7 dad looked @CAPS18 shore for something to pull @CAPS7 pole in with but to @CAPS7 surprise he found it @CAPS18 shore down river.Will @CAPS20",20,22,42,0.7
21210,8," @DATE1 my birthday, my boyfriend @PERSON2 took me to @LOCATION1 to @ORGANIZATION2's. I had never been there it was exciting and a new food experience for me. My dad had promised me that he would take me because it was my @NUM1 birthday and he wasn't there for my @NUM2 birthday. But he forgot so my dads girlfriend called the restaurant and told the manager that it was my birthday and to give me anything that i wanted and just to charge it on her credit card. This is where mine and @PERSON2's adventure started..  The beging of our adventure. Driving on the old back roads of @CAPS1 in the old @ORGANIZATION1 on our way to @LOCATION1. Just @PERSON2 and I, the roads were damp with the mid-afternoon dew, the trees with their beautiful leaves of all different color's of red's, green's, and orange. Bouncing around from the dips in the old road. @NUM3 bumpin on the stereo, only singing the parts we know. When we got to @CAPS2 we got lost because we took the wrong exit and ended up in @LOCATION2 the other side of where we were supposed to be. Being lost in a way bigger city than @PERSON1 or @CAPS1 wasn't good, We had no clue where we were.  First place we go to was a strip mall that had a big party store. we go inside and theirs @CAPS4 decorations as far as the eye could see. Monster's, whitche's, and goblin's. We got side tracked by all the scary things I realized that I had to go to the bathroom. While I went to the bathroom @PERSON2 asked one of the store clerks where we could find this @CAPS5. The guy tells us hes never heard of a place like that. So we got back into the @ORGANIZATION1, there was a lady getting out of her car so we asked her. She said yeah its just down a couple of streets. As we drive down the highway we couldn't find it anywhere. Somehow we are lost all over again so we find another covenant store up this really big hill. we didn't think that the little @ORGANIZATION1 could make it up such a big hill. We made it to the top, went inside and had the clerk look up on his phone were we needed to go. As we waited all I could think about was how bad my feet were hurting in those shoes. We got the address and took off again for our search.   About twenty minutes later we still had no luck at finding this restaurant and to top it off we had a reservation so we couldn't be late. We find another covenant store and @PERSON2 ran in to ask. The clerk told us to get back on the highway I was like no no stay on this road. We followed the empty road and right around the corner there it was @CAPS5. We were happy to have found it finally and we weren't even late. All @PERSON2 and I could do was laugh because we had gotten so frustrated to find the stupid place that it was just so funny you couldn't help but not to laugh. It brought @PERSON2 and I just that much closer we had gotten through that by laughing instead of fighting. And that we our funny adventure story. ",18,17,35,0.5833333333333334
21217,8,"So my friends and i got into a heated discusion on how we need to keep things to our selves cause one of my friends told people some personal things about us. He caused us allot of problems in school and around town, @CAPS1 he started to lie to us one of my other friends lost it and went after him and tackled him down told him to quite lying. By the time he let him up and we all got back in are seats he started to spill his guts to us, he told us some rumers he started about us and some other things he did we kinda all lost it. So we calmed down a little then took turns talking to him, after my two friends talked it was my turn i was talking to him and he kept interupting me, finally i got mad and i grabed something off the floor to throw at him. Don't git me wrong not to hurt im to stop him from interupting me. I reached down grabed something soft without looking picked it up and threatened to throw it at him and he started to point and laugh, I stoped turned my head to look at what was in my hand. now remember it was an intense conversation you could cut the tension with a nife, for him to start laughing and everyone join in i didnt want to know. But i turned my head looked and fell over laughing it was a stuffed fairy i picked up off his floor i did through it at him, but playfully. We all finally stoped laughing and sat back down. I believe that it calmed us down enough to help exsplain and make things better for him and all of us. the moral of the story is even though your mad something will always make you smile and make your day better .",11,16,30,0.5
21222,8," laughter is the best medicine,well that is what some people say. I think that laughter is good for you and if you are in a relationship laughing is really good for that. @CAPS1 here are some of the ways laughing is good for you. laughing in a relationship is good because if you can't laugh together you probably not be together. If you can't laugh with your boyfriend/girlfriend you will not have a very good relationship with him/her. @CAPS1 don't be scared to laugh a little with your boyfriend or girlfriend. I think and I think most people will say the same thing to that if you want a good relationship you need to laugh.laughing is good when you are sad because you can get told a joke and if it is a good joke it can make you feel better.It works at school to you laugh with your friends and all your stress will go away.if we all just laugh about more things and not take things @CAPS1 sonorously we would not have @CAPS1 many bad stuff happen in the world. we will all get along better and not get in fights in school,wouldn't have @CAPS1 many people in jail or person,   @CAPS1 that is why i think laughter is the best medicine for people who are sad,stress,and in relationship. But you think what you want but this is what i think is good about laughing.",15,12,27,0.45
21227,8," For me there are so many parts in my life that involve laughter. Having fun and laughing are the main things that I do in my life. When I laugh I feel happy, so whenever I'm sad or mad people can always tell a joke or something to make me giggle and then I'm happy again. I love making people laugh. Sometimes when I try and make people laugh I tell a joke but I'm not that funny. When I just be myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying.  I have amazing friends, I mean absolutely amazing, although we have our rough days I still love them and thank @CAPS1 for them everyday. My friends and I are always cooking up some way to have fun, and every time we find something to do @CAPS2 always turns out to be funny. Even the little things, such as facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food makes us laugh. @CAPS2's actually pretty ridiculous. When my friends and I try to tell other people about our extremely hilarious adventures, they all just stare at us as we burst into laughter. @CAPS2's possible that people don't think @CAPS2's funny because they weren't there.   This year my family has an exchange student named, @PERSON1. She is from @LOCATION2. She is very shy and quiet. @PERSON1 never seemed like the type to make me laugh, @CAPS5 boy was I wrong. She is possibly the funniest thing to walk the @LOCATION4. I sure think she's funny, anyway. Sometimes she is so oblivious that @CAPS2 is just hard not to laugh at her. I have a best friend named @PERSON2. We have so many fun memories together. She is amazing and funny. She is so short, people call her a midget, she is quick to reply, ""I am not a midget! I am @NUM1' @NUM2'', you have to be @NUM1' @NUM4'' to be a midget!"" @CAPS2 is so cute when she does this.  I recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @LOCATION1. While I was living there I had been informed (over the phone I might add) that there was a girl living in my old bedroom. ""@CAPS2's a foreign exchange student from @LOCATION2,"" my family told me. I flew back up to @LOCATION3 for @CAPS4 with my family. When I got here I met @PERSON1. She seemed so quiet and sweet. @CAPS2 was late when we got home so I immediately went to sleep. The next day I woke up, called my grandma, then called @PERSON2 and asked her to come over and hang out with me. She came and met @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told us she wanted to get my mom a birthday gift and I replied, ""@CAPS5, that's tomorrow, lets go into town."" All three of us went to town and went to @ORGANIZATION1 For @CAPS6. When we got there we all looked around for something we thought she might like. Somehow, we ended up in the underwear aisle. @PERSON2 picked out a tiny sized pair of underwear and shouted, ""@CAPS7 @PERSON1, what about these?"" @PERSON1 looked at her with the funniest facial expression and shouted back,""@CAPS8, I don't think my thighs would fit through that!"" @PERSON2 and I literally fell onto the floor and laughed so hard that our faces were bright red. Based on our first impression, we thought she was a quiet, ""keep to herself"" kind of girl so we just thought @CAPS2 was hilarious. We tease @PERSON1 about this quite often and she teases back about other funny things we've encountered. I've grown to love @PERSON1 and I love being with her and making fun out of all situations.

21244,8,"so one time my friends chad, justin and i ding dong ditched this old man. the reason we did this is because we would walk by his house everyday and he would turn on his sprinkler and this annoying alarm thing. so at like nine or ten at night we walked over to his house, banged on his door and ran. it was so funny cuz when we got back from running we went to our friend taylors house and we where sittting in the garage just basking in the glory of what we had just accomplished. about ten seconds later we heard banging on the garage door. at first we where kinda startled so we ran into taylors room, and thats when it happend... the funniest shit ever, the old mad just started scearming and banging on the door then he yelled ""come out boys what are you afraind of?!"" and we just crack up in laughter. well he totally knew we where in there so he went to the front door and started banging on that, waking up taylors mom. wel we ended up going out and talking to the guy and he said he called the cops cause he said it happened all the time. and we denied it was us, but it totally was so we couldnt help but laugh in his ugly face. he seriously looked like a turtle crossed with an eighty year old rapest. he had liver spots on his face and a terrible grey combover that wasnt fooling anyone. by the time the cops showed up the guy was long gone and we told the cop he was senile and didnt know what the hell he was talking about. so we got off scotfree. it was funny and awesome.",15,15,30,0.5
21250,8," I met my best friend, @PERSON1, in the third grade. Best friends are the people who come into your lives and stay with you for the rest of it, through the easy moments and the hard times. We learn from our best friends and share experiences with each other. No matter the distance, their friendship is always there for you, even if you are thousands of miles apart or just a few houses away. The laughter between two best friends is an element that bonds them for life, because when two friends truly laugh together, they will always have a small moment in their lives intertwined for as long as they live.  @PERSON1 and I have grown up together. We were there for each other from learning how to jump rope at school through broken bones, school-girl drama, crushes, boyfriends, heartbreaks, weddings and funerals. We helped each other get through everything from hard classes to family pets dying. We offered advice and brought hot chocolate, but this is only the beginning of our friendship. After the problems were solved, we learned how to laugh at our mistakes and move on. Together, we have gotten past slip-ups in what we say, to slipping on the floor. After we have giggled over what the other did or said, we helped them up and moved on. @PERSON1 and I know that, no matter what situation arises, we will always be there for each other, because we have the each others backs. @PERSON1 can make a joke out of any occasion. She is one of those friends that can make you smile just by seeing her face or hearing her voice. Most of the best moments in my life have usually involved @PERSON1 in some way. We have memories from lying in the driveway and watching the stars at night, to cracking up while working backstage for the local drama club. @PERSON1 can always crack me up with her perfect imitations of anyone, no matter how bad of a mood I am in. I crack @PERSON1 up all the time, usually unintentionally, by saying or doing something ridiculous, which shows my true blond side. We laugh over lines from our favorite movies and write down the funniest moments. We have shared so many memories together that we laugh over everything from driving around town and listening to music to being followed by the kiosk workers at the mall. One of the funniest times we ever spent around each other was while we worked backstage during a production by our local theater club. We laughed about everything from building sets to mistakes on stage. We had to open and close curtains in the dark, while wearing full black. I stubbed every single one of my toes that week while rolling the sets on and off stage. My hair was impossible to miss from the audience's point of view, even though I kept cramming it under a black ski hat. @PERSON1 would always have a problem opening one of the curtains that would get stuck when it was halfway open. She had to frantically tug on the rope even thought it kept getting caught in the pulley. I would laugh at her mistakes and she would laugh at mine. We both had a lot of fun watching the audience, director, and actors all at the same time. @PERSON1 and I got to stand in the back and watch all of the actors mistakes, giggling silently with each other. Every time one of the actors would make a mistake, we could watch the audience laugh and the director's face, which was usually horrified for a moment. Now whenever we mention any word or line from that play, we both start cracking up and remembering the entire weekend. There were more jokes then could ever be written down, and every time it is brought up, we remember even more funny moments.  When we are near each other, one quick look or a single word muttered under our breath can crack us both up. We can make each other laugh without even explaining what we meant, because we have shared so many experiences that we can read each others minds. Just one key expression or a twinkle in our eyes can crack the other up. Most other people around us probably would not even notice the small crinkle in the corner of our eyes or a slight smile. Those are the best codes ever imagined, because only the person that it is meant for could figure it out. The messages shared through the eyes a best friend can silently bring up subjects never spoken about and make us laugh. This is why true best friends are bonded by laughter, because it keeps them close no matter what comes, and for every moment of sadness, there are two moments of laughter and happiness.",26,22,44,0.7333333333333333
21277,8,"You know how people say that school is the most fun place to be during the day? Well i would have to be agree to that because when I'm at school I would laugh all day long when i see my friend name @PERSON1. We would have fun all day long just the three of us in the same classes but two classes but we still be laughing in the halls and in the class rooms some times at each other and people that we don't know. I always loved coming to school last year but this year is not that much fun because @PERSON1 moved into the @CAPS1-es and I don't know where she lives now but after @PERSON1 left the good old days was fun with her it sucks that we are not going to the same schools with her or her still coming to school with us now it is just the two of us @LOCATION1 and my self we hardly have some fun in class without her but most of the days we do.   I remember when @PERSON1 first came to this school she look like the other girls in our class but once we got to know her we became best friends. the next day she though that we would not like her because is a new kid at the school and that stuff we got to know her all to well because we would hang out with etcher teacher back from the seventh grade we would hang out. The thing that i always love about @PERSON1 is that she would turn anyone whom is having a bad day and turn it into a really good day for you she would always do things like that but there are some days when she is felling down and blue and @PERSON2 and me would try to make her feel but she would just get mad at us because we wasn't there for her when she needed us. I felt so bad after that but we are friends and friends so post to be there no matter what. The next day she wouldn't remember what was going on yesterday because she wouldn't remember that much when she is really mad at someone. one time in one of my classes we was not doing much in that class because there was not that much people in there we were painting and me and @PERSON1 was painting bulletin board. the colors was white and brown we kinda of got it all over the place and each other i panted her hand haft brown and the other side white and she got some of it on the paper that we was using to let it dry up so we can paint again but that did not work out so good because we had to go yo our next class. The next day we was in that class we almost the same thing but we kinda of got it on the grand, sink, sops descender, and each other we draw a little something on each other i draw a heart that has her name in it her name was in pen and the heart was in paint. In our next class we was laughing the rest of the day we even got my sister @LOCATION1 to laugh with us even through it was not that funny because we ate a lot of candy and candy makes us laughter all the time. these days are the days that I'll remember all the time because @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and I are always laughing all that time because we always find something to laugh about and talk about. Out of all the times that i laugh the most fun ones are with my friend @PERSON1 because we would have lots of fun when we are with her she is the glue that was holding us together. I think when all of us are together we are always laughing every scent of the day. No matter what we did or didn't do we would laugh all that time. This one we would say ""like"" all the time in one of our classes that we would have all that time during fifth because we was the only two girls in there with four boys and a guy teacher so @PERSON1 and me would do almost anything in that class because we would not do anything that would get us in troble.",15,15,30,0.5

Our car was crammed, and with my mom, grandma, cousin, and us two girls, @CAPS2 got really hot. @CAPS2 was about the @NUM1 of @DATE1, in @DATE3. I swear I thought we were all going to die in that car! We had the air conditioning on, but @CAPS2 didn't help much, I was in the middle of my cousin, @CAPS4, and @CAPS3. We finally got to a rest stop, and we all kinda stumbled out of the car. @CAPS3 wanted to go get a drink, so I followed. I'm pretty sure we were getting weird looks from all the people around us at this point. I was in my @LOCATION1 @CAPS6's, and @CAPS3 was in @CAPS8 @CAPS9. @CAPS2 felt like @CAPS2 had taken @NUM2 minutes to just walk to the drinking fountain. @CAPS2 was really that hot. I opened a cliff bar, while @CAPS3 was getting a drink. That is when I heard her scream. Of course, I busted up laughing, even though I didn't know what had happened. @CAPS3 turned around, and that laughter, turned to hysterical screaming. The mouth thing on the fountain had been turned towards you when you drink, so @CAPS3 was drenched. I sarcastically said, ""@CAPS12, you won't be hot for a while now will ya?"" We both laughed, and she chased me, trying to get me soaked. Sometimes, all you can do is laugh together. Later that day, when we finally reached the family reunion, they had a pool. She tried to push me in, but I took her with me. Everyone was laughing at that point. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard, than I did last @DATE2. Those were good times.",18,15,33,0.55
21284,8,"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @ORGANIZATION1 is the shortest distance between two people. They express happiness, belonging and they let you forget your worries for a few seconds. Who does not like to laugh? I will be writing a true story in which laughter will be one important part. My story will be about myself, who is an exchange student and @CAPS1 in high school, and how I got to know my today's best friend.It all started in the morning of my first day in a @CAPS1 high school. I remember clearly how nervous and excited I was. I was not able to focus on my breakfast because my mind was full of thoughts and questions. How is the school going to look like? And what are the students going to think about me? I have never been in the @LOCATION1 before and I have never been an exchange student. Because of all the worries, which were running through my mind, I did not even notice that it was already time to leave the house. This moment which I have been envision for month, finally arrived. My host-mom said good-bye to me and wished me a great day. Now I was totally by myself. I walked in the high school and went to my first class: @CAPS3. On the way to the classroom, people stared at me, but nobody said a word. Have you ever felt like you are alone even though hundreds of people are around you? This is exactly the way I felt in that moment. My first class went well, as well as my second class: @CAPS4. During @CAPS4, some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION2. Although this question seemed really stupid to me, I answered nicely with yes. My next period was drama. I had trouble finding the drama room, but luckily I met a girl on the way who showed me where I was supposed to go.Her name was @PERSON1 and she told me that she moved here last year from @LOCATION3. From the first moment I saw her, she seemed really nice to me. On the way to the classroom, she asked me questions about the difference of @LOCATION2 and the @LOCATION1. She also appeared quite interested to me. While our drama teacher was preparing a scene, we continued talking. I had the strange feeling that I have known her forever. The whole nervousness I had at the beginning of the day was gone. I told her that some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION2. She answered that they asked her the exact same question, but about @LOCATION3. Suddenly, she started to laugh. It was a happy and friendly laugh and soon I started to laugh as well. It did not feel awkward for me, sitting next to a girl I just met and we were laughing so hard. I knew that this moment, this laughter was special. I felt so happy and belonged and it let me forget all the fear and doubt for a few seconds. What I did not know in this moment, though, was that she will become my best friend. This was my true story, in which laughter was an important part. It is not easy to be @CAPS1 in school, especially if you are an exchange student. My story showed that a laughter is able to change people's thoughts and to short the distance between two people. In my case, it made me feel more comfortable and confident, which was the start of a great relationship, as well as an awesome time in the @LOCATION1. The end",20,19,38,0.6333333333333333
21292,8," Laughter can change any situation. It can be used to break the awkward silence after a bad joke is told, to reminisce about a fond memory, or to clear ones head and create the feeling of calmness. In @DATE1 opinion laughter is a form of communication. I discovered this through the coarse of the @DATE1 through many different situations. Many of the experiences were with people who spoke different languages or young children who I was able to connect with through laughter.  One of @DATE1 experiences with laughter has been with the many different exchange students that @DATE1 family has hosted. We have gotten exchange students from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION4. Most of them have rather good broken @CAPS1, but there were some words that proved difficult to describe and translate.  @DATE1 favorite exchange students was @PERSON1, a student from @LOCATION3. She lives in the northern part of the @LOCATION3, in the @LOCATION2 country. In the @LOCATION2 country they speak @CAPS2 and @LOCATION2 and culture is slightly different form the rest of @LOCATION3. What made @PERSON1 so enjoyable was her cheerful personality, her empathy, and her ability to make anyone in the room genuinely burst in to fits of laughter. I believe that this incredible ability of her's was one of the reasons that the summers I spend with her are some of @DATE1 happiest memories.  @PERSON1 could turn any activity into a lighthearted experience. I would do tasks with her like washing the dishes, a chore I didn't usually enjoy, and the entire time we would guffaw at the most outrageous things. Together we would laugh until tears were streaming from our eyes and we felt the need to go to the bathroom.  Once @PERSON1, @DATE1 best friend @PERSON2, and I spent an entire day laying in the grass at a park putting on ridiculous skits for each other, and telling comical stories, laughing until our bellies hurt. Between out bursts of laughter @PERSON1 would exclaim ""@CAPS3 you have got to stop this or I will surely explode, I have to use the restroom every ten minutes!"" @CAPS4 she would say this we would look at each other and be back to rolling on the ground laughing.  When I went to visit @PERSON1 in @LOCATION3 we had many similar situations of outrageous, uncontrollable laughter. One day we went to the @LOCATION2 parliament building with our families, @PERSON1, her sister @CAPS5, @DATE1 sister @PERSON3, and I couldn't stop acting goofy and cracking up. We toured through the serious quiet building unable to be silent or stoic, laughing at each other uncontrollably, making funny faces and dancing around, unable to contain our joy.  I don't know @PERSON1 @CAPS4 well @CAPS4 @DATE1 friends back home, but I think I will always feel a deeper connection to her then most people because with her I feel the free ability to laugh at every and anything. I have heard many different facts about laughter; if you laugh before an exam you will do better on it, moments of laughter are more prominent in your memories, and a person that laughs daily is more likely to feel less stressed and have a happier @DATE1, but the reason that I love to laugh is that it makes me feel really fantastic.",25,25,50,0.8333333333333334

After that we got to talking i started making him laugh and eventaully he said ""you make me laugh i like that i will buy some"".

21321,8," My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so i just turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS13. We did not know the name of the @CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent @ORGANIZATION1, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment.",20,18,40,0.6666666666666666
21338,8,"  About @NUM1 years ago, my best friend @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 I were having a sleep over at her house. We were in her moms room playing with this huge exercise ball. We had been jumping, standing, flipping, @CAPS6 everything you could think of but trying to do that with out falling off of it! @LOCATION1 went to go do this flip on to the ball @CAPS6 she said "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 watch this cool thing I just did!"" @CAPS3 she try's to do the same thing she did, but she messes up, @CAPS6 the giant ball went flying out from under her! We started laughing @CAPS3 hard! It was @CAPS3 funny that she almost peed her pants! But then her older sister came in, @CAPS6 that's when it all started... @PERSON1, (@LOCATION1's older sister) was always much bigger than us @CAPS3 we did @CAPS8 she said no matter @CAPS8. As soon as she walked in we stopped @CAPS8 we were doing! She said that she wanted to play a game with us, @CAPS3 we decided to play too. @PERSON1 told us to get on the bed @CAPS6 go under the blankets. @CAPS3 we did @CAPS6 right when we did the light shut off! @CAPS6 the door slammed shut! We didn't know if she was still in the room or not @CAPS3 we didn't say a word.  The next thing you know, the door barley creeks open @CAPS6 you can see a little bit of light through the crack. She was back, @CAPS6 with supplies! It was silent for about @NUM2 minutes, then @LOCATION1 starts screaming! Right when I look over @LOCATION1 is getting dragged out of the bed by her feet. While I'm trying to bring her back up I feel someone grabbing my feet! There I go, right where @LOCATION1 is! We kept trying to hide,@CAPS6 get back up on the bed, but we eventually gave up because our plan didn't work that well. All of a sudden my feet were tied together! Then my hands @CAPS6 mouth! @PERSON1 kept throwing us around the room @CAPS6 hitting us, she thought it was the funniest thing in the whole world! She was laughing @CAPS3 hard, especially when we kept trying to get back on the bed with tied hands @CAPS6 feet.  After an hour of struggling me @CAPS6 @LOCATION1 had an idea! We thought if we hid in the bathroom she couldn't get us anymore @CAPS6 we would try to un-tie each others bandannas @CAPS6 ropes. But before we could do that @PERSON1 beat us to it! She had thrown us into the bathroom corner with the lights off! It was silent. ""@LOCATION1 @CAPS8 is that noise? "" I said. ""@CAPS4 the bath!"" she said. We tried to get out, but right when we did, @PERSON1 picked us up @CAPS6 threw us in! She was laughing the whole time! While we were screaming yelling for each other. @CAPS6 for help!   When we got out of the bathtub she threw us back up on the bed @CAPS6 finally untied our bandannas @CAPS6 ropes! After she turned the light back on we looked at our wrists @CAPS6 ankles @CAPS6 there was red marks all over them. @LOCATION1 said ""@CAPS5! Your crazy, we told you to stop @CAPS6 you didn't!"" @CAPS6 right after she screamed that @LOCATION1's @CAPS7 walks in. ""@CAPS8 is all the yelling for girls?"" @CAPS6 then it all came out! In the end @ORGANIZATION1 got in trouble @CAPS6 we got out of it. @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 I learned a huge lesson. Never ""play a game"" with your older sister when she has bandannas @CAPS6 ropes!",16,18,34,0.5666666666666667
21343,8," He laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day. It was just after @DATE1 and @PERSON2 and I had just fixed our off and on relationship. He had picked @CAPS1 up from my house so we could hangout at his. He had seemed upset since he had picked @CAPS1 up which was completely out of the norm for him. He was always smiling or laughing and had some funny story to tell @CAPS1, but not today. Today he was quite, we had been together for about two hours already and he'd said all of about a sentence to @CAPS1 and I had only gotten one of those lame half smiles that really meant ""I'm not in the mood so just stop"".  We were watchingDespicable @CAPS1 for about the third time when the yelling started, he was standing against the wall next to his bed when his dad just started shouting, his voice was followed by a higher softer voice yelling back, it was @PERSON2's step mom. The were arguing about cheating or drinking or staying out to late, I really don't remember, I couldn't hear to well and I was paying attention to @PERSON2 to watch for his reaction. He stood where he was for a couple minutes just staring straight in front of him, he looked like he was going to cry. Then he slumped to the ground, pulled his knees up, crossed his arms over them and put his head on his arms, for a second I thought he was crying. My big tough guy who didn't ever deal with anyone's crap looked as hurt and helpless as he could get, he looked more helpless then I felt. I mean what could I do, I had no idea whether he would want to be left alone or if he'd want someone to hug him and make him feel better so I sat where I was, on his bed, leaning against the wall just looking at him hoping he do something to help @CAPS1 decide what would help him feel better. In the living room his parents were still screaming and yelling at one another when another voice joined in, it was his step mom's friend, @PERSON1. She was trying to stop them from fighting, trying to help but @PERSON2's dad, @PERSON3, wasn't one to interrupt, when he was mad you simply stayed out of his way. @PERSON1 had made a mistake. Suddenly there was a crash, @PERSON2 jumped, and the sound of cupboards being slammed and glass being broken, the only statement I could make out was ""that was your grandma's, your mom is gonna be pissed!"" from @PERSON2's step mom. @PERSON2 got up, walked over to his door, and locked it. He stood there for a second with his forehead against the door then he turned and walked over to @CAPS1, he laid @CAPS1 down and cuddled with @CAPS1.   There was more shouting now, something about food, cars, and getting all of someones crap out of the house. There was the sound of food being thrown, then a door slamming and tires screeching. Finally they were done. @PERSON3 was leaving too, you could tell by the sound of a big diesel truck driving off. Now we were alone, @PERSON2 finally looked at @CAPS1, I could tell he was sad, he still looked like he wanted to cry. I could tell he hated the fighting and that's when I realized that's what had been wrong with him all day, they had been fighting like this all week, they were getting divorced. It wasn't the first divorce he had been through either, that was his dads third wife that had just walked out the door.   ""@CAPS2, that's hell and really scary. Promise @CAPS1 WE will @CAPS3 fight like that?"" I said. I had @CAPS3 heard anyone fight like that and frankly it scared @CAPS1, I would @CAPS3 want that kind of thing going on in my house.  ""I promise.""he smiled.  I kissed him on the nose and went to get up but he pulled @CAPS1 back down and kissed my nosed, I looked at him and smiled "" @CAPS4, I really really gotta pee."" That was all it took, he laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day.",25,22,47,0.7833333333333333
21345,8,"Laughters importance in human life   In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter. @CAPS1 and friends always come together and share a good laugh, it's why we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My @CAPS1 every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favorite times becuase when my @CAPS2 shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying becuase you are laughing so hard. He has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day. @CAPS1 is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have yourself a great time! My @CAPS2 has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny, it is the timeing in which he does it. I wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face becuase not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough, and you never know taht person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then it's a domino affect. He/she will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else's day better just by a small and simple laugh.  Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another, sometimes thats all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. So every one can share a good laugh, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a ""hoot and a holler"" every now and then. When I met now my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgetable laugh. From that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us, so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh.  Laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in. The military has to go to war and live in an hostile inviroment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. It is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter that wants to come out. When your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becuase the people that truely care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day, it's like a refreshment for your body. When i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life becuase it can turn anything negative into a positive. When you go to a party with @CAPS1 or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing, no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody.  I believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person, it shows who they are becuase nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny, it's just not possible for somebody to do. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need. When two or more people are gathered the ability to create an enviroment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this, it is so true ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"".",15,17,32,0.5333333333333333
21346,8," A @CAPS1 time ago when I was about @NUM1 years old. I had moved to @LOCATION1, after @NUM2 weeks went by @CAPS2 parents started going to church, while we was at church I meet some other kid who was about @CAPS2 age. I didn't know but I saw in his hand. @CAPS6 hasa deck of card. I noticed it right away that @CAPS6 liked to play yu-gi-oh which is a card game, which is very fun to play when I was @NUM1..., I wanted to ask him if @CAPS6 wanted to play the card game yu-gi-oh but I was too nervous to ask him, after church ended and @CAPS2 parents and I went home the day passed by. The next morning I had to get ready for @CAPS2 first day in school in @LOCATION1, it was kinda hard since I am going to be in that new school with no friends but once I got their I notice something right away i saw that same kid from yesterday I was kinda surprise since @CAPS6'd go to the same church as me. After @CAPS2 teacher told me to sit down I took a seat, @CAPS2 teacher begin roll call saying each students in are class name, each students replied and said ""here!"" when it came to that other kids turn his name was @PERSON1,once class started it went by kinda fast when you are busy doing class work so once lunch started I went to have lunch and surprisingly a lot of students in @CAPS2 class are nice to me they asked if I wanted to be their friends. I was happy since they asked but that one kid @PERSON1 didn't ask. So I thought @CAPS6 was mad at me later on after school before I gotten on the bus to go home I saw that @PERSON1 kid again so I ran to him and asked if @CAPS6 liked playing yu-gi-oh? @CAPS6 ""replied yea what bout you?"" I ""told em yea we should play yu-gi-oh sometimes"" @CAPS6 said we could play this @DATE1 at church. I told em @CAPS3. later on that day I told @CAPS2 older brother @CAPS4, I made some friends at are school, and this @DATE1 I'm going to play yu-gi-oh card with one of them named @PERSON1 who goes to are church, @CAPS2 brother @CAPS4 told me oh... @PERSON1 goes to are school? I said yea and @CAPS6 said I played yu-gi-oh card game with him last time at church. I was shock since @CAPS2 older brother knew @CAPS6 was and i didn't that time. I asked him why @CAPS6 didn't tell me @CAPS6 knew someone that play yu-gi-oh card, @CAPS6 said "" cause you didn't ask"" I was like... Oh..... Me and @CAPS2 brother started to laugh cause i didn't know @PERSON1 was @CAPS2 older brother friend and @CAPS6 laughed at me cause I never asked him if @CAPS6 knew anyone that played yu-gi-oh card game.",15,16,31,0.5166666666666667
21377,8," When I was young me and my friends would play at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was a @CAPS2 in the middle of a orchard, there was a slide, diving bored, and two rope swings. All @DATE1 long we would sit, play, swim, and laugh down at the @CAPS2. We would have are @CAPS4 day party, and calibrate the @CAPS5 of @DATE2 down at the @CAPS2. There is one day I can remember so well that its like it was yesterday. The last day of school had just ended, my friends and I got on the bus as fast as we could. When the bus stopped at the @CAPS2 we all started running and striping down to are swim trunks. I was the first one in, as a result I was the first one to relies the water was as cold as the river, it felt like a thousand little nettles stabbing me over and over again. My friends described me as a bouncy ball because I got out as fast as I got in. As soon as my friends saw my blue lips the all started laughing so hard that some of them fell in to the freezing water themselves. After that we walked you to @CAPS1 house and asked him to turn on the generator, after about an hour the lake was warm enough to swim in. After a we all had swam around for a bit we decided to go of the rope swing. After a while we started doing back flips, when we stopped are backs and chests were as red as the apples in the orchard, and are throats hurt from laughter. As well as being sore from hitting the water over and over again, we were also hungry so we fired up the grill and started making burgers. When the first and second batches resembled a mound of coal, we decided to order pizza. We spent the time by air soft, when the pizza arrived the lake had thousands of air soft @CAPS7's floating in it. As we ate we sat on the small dock and stuck are legs in and collected what ever @CAPS7's came near. Soon after eating we started playing hide and seek in the orchard. After ten or so rounds we were all scraped up by running throw the trees, so of course we pored soda on are cuts, to this day I still wonder why we did that because it really hurt. Once we were done being stupid we laughed at are self's, then we laughed at each other. It wasn't long before we played swimming base ball, the bases were the corners of the docks and the pitcher was on the floating plat form. we used floating balls and swam from base to base. Eventually the sun started to set and we made a fire by the side of the @CAPS2 and roasted marshmallows over it. When are @CAPS9 came to get us we were in the middle of a belly-flop contest. Before we left we promised that we would never forget that day, and that we would be friends forever and laughter would always be the glue. That night I stayed up all night thinking of all the fun and all the laughs we had that day, it was definitely the start of one of the best and one of the most memorable summers of my life.",16,18,34,0.5666666666666667
21405,8," I don't think people today laugh enough. Laughing is said to be one of the healthiest things out there. I've heard that the more you laugh, the longer you live. If that's true, I should live forever! I believe laughing really is healthy for you.  I have a friend who's really sick right now, but when I'm with her I can make her laugh like crazy and it seems to make the pain go away. If I could cheer her up @NUM1 I'd be happy to do so. Yesterday her and I were together and I can't remember what we were talking about but it must of been good because she got me to laugh to hard that I threw up! I know that doesn't sound very fun, but even as I was coming up from doing that we were both still laughing. Times like that I can definitely look back and smile on. I love the effect laughter has on people. I've been sitting down at a bus stop and giggling or laughing for absolutely no reason and the people next to me will start laughing! That only makes me laugh harder then everyone's doing it! Also as long as you're with friends, or anyone for that matter, and you can laugh, that means you're having fun and enjoy each others company. I don't see the point in being friends with someone who can't at least make you giggle a bit.  The other day me and my friend were sitting in the car, it was dark, quiet and we were just talking. Out of no where my mom pops up saying, ""@CAPS1!"" (this always happens though.) @CAPS2 did we scream our lungs out. I guess we should have expected her to do something like that though. After we caught our breath, we both looked at each other only to start laughing hysterically at how silly that was.  Laughter really does bring people together, whether you're strangers or best friends. When you're laughing with someone you're usually laughing for the same reason, right? Just as my friend and I were in the car. That's what I love, because that means we have things in common.",20,20,40,0.6666666666666666
21413,8," Laughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect. Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter. Many times my family of four departs to go camping during the @DATE1. Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations. A couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends, I experienced and learned what true, rich laughter could do that changed my life. Whether I learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire, playing little practical jokes on each other, or just some old friendly card games of hearts, I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me. My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan. It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating, to set up their tent. They managed to make a @NUM1 minute task take two hours, bravo to them. The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer. While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first, only to then turn it inside out second. What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humor.  The boys however didn't think it was quite so funny, however by @TIME1 fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us. Wake up call rolled around at about four in the @TIME2 for us two girls in a non-sound proof tent. We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We found out later, that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was game on after the boys pulled that prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent. A zip tie would do the job. In the middle of the @TIME1, sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went and told the guys our plan. The three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next @TIME2 my friend and I woke, we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and that's not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us, barely letting the knife out of our reach. When I finally had hold of the small blade, I ripped open the zippers, gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room. When I got back to blood on the ground, I found that it wasn't as gentle of a toss as I thought it was. The same guy that gave us the knife to use, put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife. Once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches. Campfire that @TIME1 was a hoot. Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead @TIME1. Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because we're laughing so hard. My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans, put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that @TIME1. It was the @TIME1 together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing, with just being our self's and expressing without trying to impress. Later as we're all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now after our times shared we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the @TIME1 spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, by turning a camping trip in to something much more meaningful.",25,21,46,0.7666666666666667
21443,8," Every time I walk down the hall and I see a couple, they are either laughing with each other or doing other things that could disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people that get voted cutest couple at our school are the ones that are laughing as opposed to the later. Not only does laughing create couples, then families, and eventually the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activites, etc. That's why personally I believe that laughing is the single most powerful action a person can do. Every person I am friends with have laughed with me and vice-versa. Especially one friend who I've gotten even closer since we met. I was very adament about going to church when I was young. I have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without reticule. However I saw one girl sitting in the back corner who I felt was scared just like I probably would have been if it was anywhere else. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people.  I did that for maybe the first time in my life to say ""hi"" to her. She replied by giving me her name. However I went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again. However, I was only in third grade when all this happened so as time passed by things changed. About @NUM1 years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself into that classroom as one of two who regularly showed up. However this one day I was the only one who was there for my age group. Well actually I was the only one from my age group that was there on time. I saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class. It took me a while to picture who it was but eventually I realized who it was. It was the girl who was scared to be in church and now she was the girl who was scared to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I made a hand gesture telling her to come in. then you saw her smile. She shortly proceded to laughing a little bit. This was when I realized I met someone special. Now everytime I see her she smiles. That's how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughing can't be put into quotes, but it can be put into someone's memories for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten.",17,25,34,0.5666666666666667
21449,8,"One day my friend and I were waking up late in the day and his brother came in screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs ""bro bro""! This was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old, so my friend spencer calmed him down and we started watching t.v. We were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now. Spencers mom asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little borther. So we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music. Unlike everyone who uses an ipod I use my phone because then I can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so I'll know. It was a brand new phone too and i was loving every moment of having it. So when we dropped his little brother off we went back too the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I put my phone on my shirt and my towl over both so when spencer got out too use the towl he jerked the towl out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way too the hot tub. That moment I look down and see it and freak I took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the towl hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dialing zero and nine so I took the battery out again. When we got back to his moms i plugged in the charger with no battery and spencer kept saying sorry and I kept answering ""its ok"". The next morning his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice and we started laughing because we freaked out so bad over a phone. I forgot all about the phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories. ",16,16,32,0.5333333333333333
21450,8,"@DATE1 what a night!! Me and my friends we were going to a @CAPS1 party at our dance coaches work. we had to dress up as elves and play with kids. It was fun, but after we were done with the party that's when the real fun began! After we changed out of our costumes and back into our regular clothes we started taking pictures. @CAPS3 were funny ones,cute one, and weird ones,all kinds of pictures. Anyways my friends and i didn't want to go home just yet so we decided that we should go to some places to take more pictures and have more fun! First stop was a school play ground but we couldn't stay because it was late and we weren't allowed inside so we decided to go to the discovery park i was driving and one of my friends in the passenger seat was taking pictures that turned out really funny. so when we got to the park my friend that was taking the pictures said  @CAPS2 i drive around the parking lot?"" I said sure. we switched spots and off we went. She was a pretty good driver, but @CAPS3 was some scary moments that i felt we were going to die. ha ha. So she drove around and then went to the stop sign by a main road where she decided it would be a good time to switch back and i was yelling at her ""@CAPS3's a car coming we @CAPS2 get in trouble"", but no she didn't listen to me she got out so then i had to get out and we were yelling at each other and my friends in the back seat were yelling also not because we were mad but we didn't want to get caught and we were having a lot of fun. so i get back in the driver seat and we are all yelling "" get in the car"" but she laughing really hard saying "" I wet my pants."" we all started laughing because we thought she was kidding but oh no she was serious she was laughing so hard that she actually wet her pants! It was a good thing she had extra pants with her. So i had to back up the car so she could change behind this big metal thing. As she was changing we thought it would be really funny if we got a picture of her changing so i got the camera and stuck it out the window, but it was really dark even with the flash on so the picture didn't come out! she was laughing so hard that we teased her saying "" keep it in"". We still tease her a lot about it even though it's been two months. When ever we are laughing really hard and someone says "" oh i think I'm gonna pee my pants"" we look at @PERSON1 and say "" @PERSON1 knows what that's like"" we have too much fun teasing her about things she's done.  the next day we go and tell the rest of our friends that weren't with us what happened and they all started laughing as hard as we did. At the time she wasn't in the room with us when we told the rest of our friends, but when she walked in and we all stopped and saw her it was really hard to keep from laughing. now everyone knows about that night and @PERSON1's "" accident"". every now and then we make fun of her but she laughs along because we all know it could have been anyone of us. It still makes me laugh today not as much as it did back when it really happened, but you @CAPS2 still get a laugh on it every now and then.""",17,18,35,0.5833333333333334
21483,8," My grandfather always used to say, ""life is like a kaleidoscope, you can keep turning and turning and it @MONTH1 seem like it is changing, @CAPS1 really it's just repeating itself."" @CAPS1 i have always wondered if the statement really applies to life, and if it does why would we want life to continue in the same pattern, if it isn't going like we had planned.  When i was twelve me and my two little sisters were split up and three thousand miles were crammed in between us. i was put here in @LOCATION2 while they remained in @LOCATION1, where i was born. At first the pain of those three thousand miles was devastating. it was like i had two of my essential organs removed from my body. Eventually though time passed and the agony lessened @CAPS2 grip on our lives. It @MONTH1 seem cruel @CAPS1 most of the time now the thought of them doesn't cross my mind. maybe @CAPS2 true what they say, ""out of sight, out of mind.""  @CAPS2 sad to think of how close my sisters and I were before the change. we did everything together. we are very close in age, the youngest and I are only @NUM1 years apart. i remember all the times we would spend outside on humid @DATE1 days. We would look as white as ghosts because of all the sunscreen my mother would generously apply to our skin. Times were different then, they were happy, i was happy. If i think really hard I can see us sitting on the shag carpet in my room, playing with dolls until the sunlight melted slowly into darkness. If only i could have that moment again even for a second, then maybe i could feel that happy content feeling once again.   Although much time has passed since our separation i still have those days when i feel that my world is caving in around me because they are so far away. I'll give them a call and the questions are always uncomfortable at first, like between strangers meeting for the first time. i can feel the three thousand mile scab on my heart reopen and it bleeds as though i am leaving all over again. I ask myself why do i bother to call if it hurts this bad? And then i hear it, like the beautiful sound of classical music to my ears, I hear them laugh. I have that feeling i needed all of a sudden, i am happy. With every small giggle my smile grows because i know i have made them feel whole again and for a second i have let them forget about for far i really am. Their laughter makes those three thousand miles evaporate into the air. In those moments of laughter i know that we are close again that we are sisters, not strangers. It's true what my grandfather says, because no matter how my life changes i will always have that feeling of total bliss when i hear the sweet laughs of my little sisters.",20,21,41,0.6833333333333333
21485,8,"Freshmen year, @CAPS1 season. I have been @CAPS1 for about eight years now, I made varsity in a @NUM1 school in @LOCATION1 my first year in high school. Being the only freshmen on the varsity squad, everybody knew who I was, ""The short kid on the varsity @CAPS1 squad."" @CAPS2 a eighth grader I won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without @CAPS1 a full match. Meaning that I pinned everyone in the first round. I couldn't be touched. Going into high school I knew that I wouldn't have @CAPS2 easy of a time like in grade school. I was completely right. My coach had to be the funniest person that I have ever met in my life. @PERSON1 was my @CAPS3 teacher since the @NUM2 grade and has been my role model all the way through life. He made the funniest jokes about wrestlers on the team. A lot of people disliked @PERSON1 @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and him got along great. I ended the season freshmen year with @NUM3 wins, @NUM4 pins, and @NUM4 losses. I still to @CAPS13 day haven't been pinned. Which got @CAPS4 the wrestler of the year awarded by my @CAPS1 coach @PERSON4. When the season rolled around to regionals I knew that I had a shot to go to state. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I have previously beaten in early season. I had to just worry about my match ahead of @CAPS4 and wrestle mistake free.  At the @NUM6 pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I got seated first seed. The second seed was @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1. He dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state. My first match I wrestled @CAPS5 from @CAPS6-@CAPS7-@CAPS8. The match was very short-lived. I pinned him in about @NUM4 seconds. After my match with @CAPS5 I walked to my coach and he told @CAPS4 a quote that I will never forget, ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11's lonely at the top, @CAPS12 the view is excellent."" @CAPS13 quote stuck in my head throughout all of my next matches. I won my second and third matches and was in the semi-finals. I was one round away from going to state automatically. I wrestled @CAPS5 from @PERSON3 and he weighed @NUM8 lbs. I knew that he was a good wrestler even though I had about @NUM9 pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and I seen @CAPS5 warming up across the gym from @CAPS4. @CAPS2 he was jumping around getting warmed up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him. @CAPS11 was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. I wrestled through the match and pinned him in double overtime to go to state. My coach walks up to @CAPS4 and says ""@CAPS11 took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face."" @PERSON1 had about three teeth total in his mouth. He lost them from a lot of different ways. He was a adventure man. He loved white water rafting and loved the sport of @CAPS1. When I moved, I was far away from my idolized @CAPS1 coach, @CAPS12 we still hit @CAPS11 up on the facebook and chitchat. To @CAPS13 day, he is still the funniest man I know and still my idol.",20,16,36,0.6
21500,8," Do you ever have those weekends when you hang out your best friend and just spend the whole time laughing? Many people don't get the chance to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have people to laugh with. In my case I am always laughing and always surrounded with people that never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst of moods and @CAPS14 always knows how to put a smile on my face. @ORGANIZATION1 and I hang out all the time. Every time we @CAPS11 together we @CAPS11 constantly laughing to the point to where we cant breathe. One day we were both just having a rough day. All the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I get a phone call from @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS11 you doing today?"" @ORGANIZATION1 asked. ""@CAPS2 just sitting at home watching movies. You?"" I replied ""@CAPS3 i am having a bad day, would you wanna come over or something?"" @ORGANIZATION1 said in an upset tone. ""@CAPS4. Hold on, let me ask."" I said as I was running to my parents room. My parents of course said yes. About an hour later I got picked up by @CAPS5 dad. When I got in the car I could just tell by the way @CAPS14 looked that @CAPS14 was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun. When we got back to her house we went in her room and started talking. About five minutes after the conversation had started we were both crying like babies because of the problems that were going on. we weren't only crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again. @ORGANIZATION1 and I could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us. @CAPS3 that day was the day. @CAPS5 dad walked in the room because of all the noise. ""@CAPS1 is going on in here?"" @CAPS7 asked with a stern voice. ""@CAPS8 dad."" We said still laughing. ""@CAPS9 then."" @CAPS7 replied with a really confused face walking out of the room. Closing the door behind him. That made us laugh even harder. We were laughing so hard that @ORGANIZATION1 fell off of her bed. ""@CAPS11 you @CAPS9!"" I tried asking but it didn't really come out because I was laughing so hard. All @ORGANIZATION1 could do was roll on the floor laughing. @CAPS13 you knew @ORGANIZATION1 you would know that once @CAPS14 gets going @CAPS14 thinks that everything in the universe is funny, literally. The rest of the night we just sat on her bed and talked about everything. Stuff that either happened two years ago or just happened that week. I remember her telling me a story about when @CAPS14 lived somewhere else and it was seriously the funniest story i have ever heard. I've been best friends with her for three years now and I never get sick of her. Some people that hang out with @ORGANIZATION1 and I don't really understand why half the stuff we say is funny. A few months ago we were hanging out with some friends and all of the sudden @ORGANIZATION1 screamed, ""@CAPS12 on my finger!"" @CAPS13 you were to just hear that from someone you would @CAPS2 be disgusted but when @CAPS14 screamed that I started laughing so hard my stomach hurt. One time when we were sitting in her room @CAPS14 wanted to paint my nails and @CAPS14 picked this ugly brownish gold color. @CAPS14 started to paint my nails. ""@ORGANIZATION1 it looks like i have @CAPS12 on my finger!"" I said in a loud voice. ""I think it looks very nice."" @CAPS14 replied with this certain smile on her face. Ever since that night @CAPS12 on my finger has always been our inside joke. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have the funnest times together. Times that you can only have with a best friend. The hours we spend just sitting there laughing over the simplest things you couldn't do with anyone else. I am so thankful to have someone that I can share all this laughter with. Remember, you @CAPS11 lucky that you have people that can make you laugh. Like I said not everyone has that person in there life.",17,20,37,0.6166666666666667

I was determine to wait @CAPS3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON6. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS20' music brought us together.  @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I wrote a @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1; I thought to myself ""@PERSON6 is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched @PERSON4 write the @CAPS2. Weeks @CAPS3 weeks past by @CAPS3 I really thought @ORGANIZATION1 wasn'@CAPS8 going to read or reply. After that @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON6 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON4 calls @CAPS3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS15 I called my friend @PERSON4--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I @CAPS3 two of my friends: @PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS6 way there, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I were telling @PERSON5 @CAPS3 @PERSON4 about @CAPS6 amazing experience in health: @CAPS6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS3 @CAPS6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS3 @PERSON4 presented me to his friend @CAPS8.J; @CAPS18 was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS9."" @CAPS10 we played various games I notice @CAPS8.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS3 when @CAPS18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS8 help but notice @CAPS18 somewhat reminded me of @CAPS6 drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend @CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said ""@CAPS8.J looks like my alien,"" @CAPS18 said ""wow that's rude."" I said ""In my eyes that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh @CAPS3 kept playing games @CAPS3 listening to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I had to meet, to work on @CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS3 the things that we like @CAPS3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS3 wouldn'@CAPS8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a @CAPS1, a way of life telling me ""hang on, you'll make it;"" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when @PERSON4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said "" @PERSON4 answer the phone!"" @CAPS15 @CAPS18 did. @CAPS18 said "" oh my god, @CAPS16 is @PERSON6, I said ""stop messing around, now lets get back to work!"" @CAPS17 put his phone on speaker, @CAPS3 there it was; my hero on the phone! I was @CAPS15 happy that I started to cry, how could this be happening to us! I blacked-out, it was like I was stoical. How could this ever happen to ""quotidian teens."" I could hear @PERSON4 talking to @ORGANIZATION1 but I was making my my mind convoluted. I took a gasp of air, @CAPS3 said ""hello."" (I was still in shock.) @CAPS18 said "" hello @PERSON3, good luck in track."" @CAPS3 that's when I past-out. When I woke up @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I couldn'@CAPS8 believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, @PERSON4 said ""@CAPS16, you talked to your husband.""

21516,8,"@CAPS4- @CAPS1 Laughter @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 I cannot imagine where my life would be right now with out laughter, who my friends would be, or @CAPS1 I would get through my day. Laughter is what created what has been one of the most important relationships in my life thus far. Laughter is what unifies us, it gives each of us something in common despite our differences. This has been proven true in my life, especially with one person, @CAPS4. I met @CAPS4 a year ago in a class of mine, we never really talked much or knew each other until that one day when she @CAPS2 me laugh. It was juts another day in class doing a lab when I see this short ginger hair girl twitching on a bar stole, I of course immediately begin to laugh. This girl was twitching around on a stole making awkward hand gestures and laughing, making me crack up, and not a single other person finds this funny, they are just giving us the you girls are insane"" stare. Others inquire what she is doing, @CAPS4 too hysterical to form actual words, I say ""hello dudes she is a dinosaur like from @CAPS7 the @CAPS8, 'I have a bid head and little arms.... I don't think this plan was though out very well....'"" @CAPS4 response with a point to me and a head shake, I knew this was the beginning a beautiful, laughter filled, @CAPS3.  There are countless times where laughter was been the center piece of my time with @CAPS4. When we are hanging out it seems that we effortlessly humor not only ourselves but others even the complete stranger. The best example I can give is when we were at @ORGANIZATION1, a hotel with an in door water park, for my birthday with two of our best friends. Our time there had already been full of laughs, pictures and a good time, but when we were all dressed up looking your something to do was the high light of the @TIME1. Two nights of no sleep, loads of sugar, and energy drinks @CAPS2 our little foursome more insane than usual, giving @CAPS4 the courage to saunter up to very attractive complete stranger and get him to say hello to the birthday girl, me. @CAPS4 and I start to bust a move and proceed to fall to the ground in laughter, at this point most people would think these @NUM1 girls are strange I am leaving now, but this guy was entertained by our laughter even he joined in on the laughter. Perhaps the best memory of @CAPS4's contagious laughter was when we went to see @CAPS1 to @CAPS14 your @CAPS15, believe me when I say this night could have easily down hill very quickly. Basically @CAPS4 was yelling at the movie, cracking, jokes, texting, making us laugh, so all the things that get you kicked out of a movie and make the people around you angry. But for some reason the people around us ate up her humor and found it hilarious, they were laughing along with us. It was one of the best nights at the movies I have ever had, I have never been on such an adventure. They way laughter has impacted my life is by giving me this amazing best friends who is crazy and humorous. @CAPS4 is one of those people who makes you realize that laughter is what unifies us and is something to do. So go ahead, act like your @NUM2 even if your @NUM3, you never know who you @MONTH1 make laugh and what friends you could make.""",17,18,35,0.5833333333333334
21560,8," When I told my mom that I wanted to @CAPS5 from sunset to sunrise to raise money for a trip to @LOCATION1, she laughed. Her laugh was one of utter sarcasm, as if she was saying, ""Is this a joke?"". Yet, when the crazy idea of running for @NUM1 hours straight was truly thought through, the laughter began to melt away. The idea made sense; I wanted to go to @LOCATION1 with my school's band with a cost of roughly @MONEY1. My family didn't have that money, and I certainly wasn't going to bribe my neighbors penny by penny to buy cheap cookie dough from a magazine. I needed to earn my money, in a way that not only was meaningful, but also efficient. What better way to do that then to do a long distance @CAPS5; a skill that I not only loved, but was also good at? The plan started small; I would @CAPS5 from sunset to sunrise with some friends, wanting to raise about @MONEY2. After consulting my distance coach, I realized that running for @NUM1 hours would entitle me to over @NUM3 consecutive miles.So what if I was fifteen years old and had never even ran a marathon before? Something in me told me it was possible. And so we laid out the plan; I was to @CAPS5 about @NUM4 miles a week, with three hour runs on @DATE3. I ran about ten miles a day, including hill repeats, running backwards, and many, many lunges. For some reason, both my coach and I agreed that I could do it.  Running was one thing, but then there was the reason behind the running; raising money. A family friend, @PERSON1, who was both a runner and an organization whiz, helped me out. When I informed him that my goal was to raise @MONEY2, he looked at me and firmly said that I could do better. We started out with local businesses, asking for things ranging from bananas to an energy gel called ""@CAPS1"". @PERSON1 taught me how to dress, talk, and present to each business, helping me create a flier to put up in coffee houses, and a way to organize the money I brought in. Next, came the friends. Surprisingly, I found that a lot of my friends not only wanted to donate, but also wanted to participate in the all-@CAPS4 @CAPS5, and thus was created the running ""shifts"". Soon, I had about twenty people who were going to @CAPS5 with me, ten businesses who sponsoring me, and four ""drivers"" who drove cars with mattresses, food, and water in the back to support me and my ""crew"". Before I knew it, my whole community was cheering me and that crazy, laughable idea on. The @CAPS4 of the ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 All-@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" came before I knew it. The day before my stomach was twisted in knots, and it almost impossible to rest. Yet, as people arrived ready to @CAPS5, drive, and cheer the whole event on, my fears began to subside. The weather was wonderful, with clear skies and decently warm temperatures for early @DATE4, and everybody who came were cheerful and encouraging. As the sun set on that fateful day of @DATE1, a group of roughly twenty teenagers all with a crazy goal and strong spirits, set off from my home in an awkward jog, knowing that they would return when the sun rose the next day having conquered something almost impossible. As we ran, headlamps were turned on, music was cranked up, quirky runner games played to pass the time, and silly songs were sung to keep our feet moving in the briskly cool @CAPS4. The hardest part for me was returning to my home after @NUM5 miles for a bathroom break around @TIME1 and realizing that I still had seven hours left. As the miles and minutes began to blend together in the seemingly endless @CAPS4, it became hard for me to believe that the sun would ever rise again. We all wanted so badly just to stop, rest, and sleep. That @CAPS4, with our feet pounding the cold pavement, we ran like shadows through the endless @CAPS4, our eyes searching for the sunrise that would signify our time to stop.  The sunrise that rose the morning of @DATE2 at @NUM6 am was the most welcoming sight I had ever seen. @NUM7 miles behind me, and well over @NUM8 for each person in my group, we were all exhausted and cold to the bone. Everyone who had been resting jumped out of the support cars and joined me for the last mile, every one of us watching with awe as light seeped into the darkness, stunning the quiet, frost-covered world on with warm light. The sun rose big and orange, and when my feet finally stopped, an exhausted yet exuberant shout left the throats of everyone. It was then, in that gorgeous sunrise, that me and mom hugged and laughed; a laugh that was not sarcastic, but spoke of how a girl who had done the impossible.",28,22,44,0.7333333333333333
21623,8," laughter is an important part of any kind of relationship like your family, friends, or your other half. Now let me tell you why it is important, there was two weeks left of school and my family had planned out to go camping for a week. Finally school was over and as we were all saying our good byes and see you next year to all our friends. My parents came to pick us up in what my dad called an ""@CAPS1"" that looked like an ordinary school bus. We were now off on our way to go to our camping site.  Now you would think that going camping would be for bringing the family together and having fun. But no my brothers were locked into their video games, my mom and sister were both on their phones while my dad was driving. I even asked them why they brought electronic devices and all i got for an answer was a ""because"". Finally i just decided to let it go and read until we got to our camp site. Finally we arrived and the first thing we did was unload the @CAPS1 and set everything up so we could get comfortable. The same night we were all by the toasty camp fire, and as usual my family was being entertained by there video games, cellphones or everything that they thought was needed out here in the wilderness. As i sat by the fire i gazed at the stars above my head and started to wonder if my family was always going to be like this and never be a close, fun or even exciting family.  The next morning after we were all awake my parents were making breakfast, and my mom had asked me if i remembered to close the @CAPS1 door before going to sleep in my tent, and i said no i forgot knowing how my mom was she got a little mad and asked my sister to go close it. As she walked up to the door she heard noises and went inside to see what it was. Before i could even blink i saw her sprinting out of the @CAPS1 and screaming off the top of her lungs. Right behind her were a group or raccoons chasing her! My dad trying to be a hero runs towards them trying to scare them off, but fails and gets bit on his butt.  Luckily my dad was @CAPS5 but while we were all distracted the raccoons had left with our food. My dad was so mad that he kicked the only log that kept the @CAPS1 from rolling away. And it starts moving right away, we all watch it go down the hill until it rode into a lake. Slowly it started to disappear once it was completely out of sight we all went to the lake staring at the large lake that devoured out @CAPS1 wondering what we were going to do with no vehicle. As we were heading back to the camp site all you could hear for miles was my family arguing. not paying attention of whats in front of them my mom fell in to a mud pit and my dad tried to get her out but slipped in too. Once they got out they looked so outraged and looked as if they were ready to call out mother nature to a fight.  Once we made it back to the camp site we sat down and i took a good look at each one of us. Our clothes were all wet and covered with mud, we were all hungry and not really in the best mood. I sat there and said dad don't get even more mad but but i thought it was pretty funny when the raccoon bit your butt, and i showed him the picture i took when it happened. My family then all looked at it and started laughing and laughing we all suddenly started talking and actually acting like a family! We decided to just walk home and hitch hike, we walked down the road for a good hour until we got a ride from a local trucker we saw down the road. Once we got home we talked more, we spent more time together we were really like the perfect family i wished i could have. That camping trip changed us all and I'm happy that it did because now me and my family are closer than ever! And that's how I can prove that laughter is an important part of any relationship.",18,17,35,0.5833333333333334

So @PERSON7 had a few ideas one was go over to @LOCATION3 house were there was an air conditioning his other idea was to walk @NUM2 miles to @CAPS1 swim hole, but the only reason he wanted to go was because his girlfriend would be there,really know one hates @CAPS1 but no body wanted to walk that far in the heat ,then walk back to @CAPS3 @NUM3 had three ideas number one of his ideas was walk to his uncles house @NUM4 miles away to see if we could catch a ride to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, his second idea was to go down to our friends @PERSON5's house and go swim in his built in pool, his third idea was to to go in the back yard i spray our selves with the hose. @PERSON1 had two ideas one was to see if he could get his mom to lend him some money to fill his tank and to pay her back,his other idea was to drive to the coast and camp there for a few days if he got the money from his mom.Byran had three ghetto ideas one was to go jump in the water fountain by the @ORGANIZATION1 then quickly get out before we got in trouble, second idea was to go over to the @LOCATION4...A.K.A. the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and hop over the fence and then he was going to let us in, his third idea was to go over to the old people homes and swim in there pool there because he said he knew a @NUM5 had three ideas one was to walk a mile to to the forks , second was to walk down to the creek @NUM4 miles away third idea was to get a whole bunch of fans and run them threw out @CAPS3 room. I was with @PERSON1 on his ideas pf going to the coast and camping and what not because i love to camp at the beach it smells all pretty most of the time there is really fine chicks so yeah i was way down to go to the coast for real.So we sat and we waited and waited and waited for @PERSON1's mom to call us finally his phone rings we were all excited but it was just his grandma calling him we were bummed all hell. so there we were once again waiting for what seem to be for ever for a phone call by @ORGANIZATION3's @NUM7 phone ring we didn't have hopes up this time we figured it was some one else but guess what this time it actually was @PERSON1's mom she said that she'll lend him the money but us boys had to do something for her she wanted us to go down to the bimor and pick @CAPS9 from work then buy her some cigars for @PERSON1's grandpa so we did.After were done the earn run we packed our clothes,blankets,sleeping bag,food,camping supplies, and wood.After a good hour it was @NUM4 @CAPS10.M. we went to the chevron and fueled @PERSON1 tank then we were off to @ORGANIZATION2 city @LOCATION1 the drive to almost two hours it seemed but what a beautiful ride long tunnels beautiful river , mountains oh and who could forget the beautiful tall red woods of @LOCATION1 and the smell of that forest you can smell it through almost any car.I thought it was funny when we got close to the coast the temperature dropped like @NUM9 degrees @CAPS11 and ever-body was in a good mood and could smell the coastal air.When we got to the camp site we ran out to the beach as jumped in people look at us like we were crazy or something because we swam like @NUM10 feet out in @NUM9 degree water it was funny because people wouldn't stop talking but then we found out we were swimming a red zone were there has been rip tide advisories so after that we were really @LOCATION2 and we realizes we had no propane so we had to go into to town and get propane for our stove so we did then we ate the best hot dogs ever dipped in @ORGANIZATION4 honey it was delicious.We stayed at the coast for a night then @PERSON6 got called in to go to work so we had to leave and go back to the heat in @CAPS12 @CAPS6 @CAPS13 it was a way way big drag and it was so hot getting back we pretty upset at the weather but when we got back @CAPS3 mom wanted to go out to the river so in the end it was all good.",17,15,30,0.5
21628,8," I never understood the meaning laughter is the shortest distance between two people, tell I dated @PERSON2. We started to date in the @NUM1 grade. @CAPS6 indeed, you @MONTH1 think it was puppy love, @CAPS4 i still think to this day it was real true love. We lived about an hour a half an hour away from each other and only got to see each other two or three times a month, @CAPS4 it was still the best time of my life, with all the good and fun times we had. We met through my ex boyfriend, and his best friend @PERSON1 @CAPS1. @PERSON1 went to school with me and @PERSON1's mom and nicks mom were best friends, so they grew up together and were best friends as well. To sum up how we met is, I was dating @PERSON1 and was supposed to go to the movies with him and his friend, @CAPS4 @PERSON1 didn't show so I was stuck with @PERSON2 and we hit it off right after that. The more time we spent together the more times we laughed, had fun and as well as that, made memories to last a life time.  If we couldn't see each other we would talk on the phone for hours. (and when i say hours i mean like, @NUM2 hours.) or we would text nonstop. we would make funny jokes, talk crap about people we hated, talk crap about family, and last @CAPS4 not least make fun of each other. we would just have so many good time just talking and laughing our time away. After about @NUM2 months of dating, things went for the worst."" I just cant do this long distance thing anymore"" said @PERSON2."" @CAPS2? @CAPS2 cant we just work things out?"" i said with tears starting to come out."""" @CAPS3 it just isn't far to us."" @PERSON2 said with hesitance in his voice."" @CAPS4 think about all the good times we had? all the laughs and fun times we had?"" I started to smile, just thinking about all those times we had."" @CAPS5 yeah, @CAPS4 is that far to us?"" @PERSON2 Said."" @CAPS6 it is, as long as we have each other nothing it to bad for us. hehe"" I said knowing that he was changing his mind slowly. "" @CAPS7 now i know i need you."" he said laughing in the back ground.After that night everything was good, for a while. we had fights like that on and off and thing with my family and his family made it vary hard for us to be together. @CAPS4 we did it for a year and a half. @CAPS4 even after a year and a half of our life's we still couldn't make it. not ever laughter or good time kept us together. @CAPS4 it did keep us together for that long. Laughter was a big impact in that relationship and i thank god that it was.Even to this vary day, i can still look back and laugh at all the good and funny times we had together.Laughter can keep two people that leave from a far together, @CAPS4 the real question is how long can that laughter keep them together?For a day?A year?Three years?Or maybe a whole life time?Only time could tell.",15,17,32,0.5333333333333333
