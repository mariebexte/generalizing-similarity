2980,2,"Do you think that libraries should remove certain materials off the shelves? People have different oppions, of whats good and whats bad. I have read and seen a lot of books in my life time. I hear people telling me, 'oh dont read that book its a bad book.'But I ask myself, @CAPS2 do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance?'      @CAPS1 are some books, music, movies, and magazines out @CAPS1 that are offensive. Yet we still want to read, listen, watch, and look at them. If we tried to remove all the offensive books, from the libraries we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves. Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work i abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson makes a great point out of her quote. Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think its offensive?     Ask yourself the question again, '@CAPS2 do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance?' @CAPS3't judge a book by what you hear. Find out what your own oppion is",2,3,2,0
2983,2,"A lot of @CAPS3 today are censored because of the content in books, music, movies, and Magazines. I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and my views on the censorship of @CAPS3. Here's my idea to fix the problem.      I understand that books and other material @MONTH1 offend certain people, but it might not offend others. Thats why I think @CAPS3 should have a room for things that might offend certain people. The sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room. There could be seperate rooms for children. It has nothing but children's books, movies, music, and magazines. Its a great idea because your child would'nt be open to the bad content.      This brings me to my next topic. You must be a certain @CAPS1 to enter the 'bad content' room. I dont think the library staff or their parents want a five-year old boy checking out a book that deals with sex, drugs, and alcohol. The library could get in a lot of trouble. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 could be @NUM1 years of @CAPS1 to enter the room. That seems fair enough. Your old enough to be able to handle the content.      I dont get offended easily, so I can read just about anything. Like I suggested previously in the article, the bad content should be moved to a room so that people dont mistakenly come across it. I like reading about anything and everything, so I would love to read things and spark my attention. Books like that usually deal with bad things. I'm okay with that, but I understand that others are not.      Seperate rooms, @CAPS1 limits, and my views are all good ideas. Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said. I think that will be very affective. I hope to start seeing that in the future",4,3,4,2
2997,2,"I think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library. All the bad books, music, magazines and movies no one really wants to read. If a kid picks up the book and reads it, and there are bad content in the books, magazines, music and movies that would be bad to read. If they are young enough and they don't know if the movies or anything else in the library are bad, then it's the library's fault for letting them get the book movies, music or magazines. If the parent doesn't know that their kid read the book their parents will be wondering where they got bad phrases from. There are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books.     There are many things in books that parents don't want their children to read. There are things like books that talk about sex. There can also be language that the kids should not read. I know for sure, that I don't want my kids to read anything bad when they grow older.         There are also music that parents don't want kids to listen to. There is things like sex songs. There are also things that don't say sex directly, but imply it. I never want my kids to listen to bad songs like that, I want them to be responsible and not listen to terrible songs.     There is also movies that I don't want my kids to watch, because of the content of the movie. There are so many things in this world that contain bad things, which all have something to do with sex. Latly all the movies that came out are very inapropriate.      Their is one more thing that I think is very important, which is magazines. There are many things that can happen in magazines like porn. I hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn. I think in general we should get rid of porn, and descusting pictures in magazines.",3,3,3,1
2998,2,"Dear news people,     I am qriting to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books. I think it is ok for people to write whatever thay want because it's a free contruy to where you can do anything that you tink you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books how ever thay want with anything in it such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on you get what I'm saying. I think it's ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It's they person who is picking a book choose to read a book just because they don't like what the book was about they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can just not pick the book up and look for another book.     I don't think it's fear that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all it makes no since to me and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I was someone who was a aganised stuff like sex, and drugs and I saw it in a book I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fare and it's a waist of time to me if someone has to complane about something so dumb.     So to rap this thing up I think people who don't like the way books are writen should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading. There is no point to waist time and cause a problem that's my oppion about this problem hope it is yours to.",3,2,3,1
3003,2,"The world in full of offensive material, and there almost nothing we can do for it. These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large varity knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material.      On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items such as centain types of music of movies are inapropate his or her age. Some partents get really  offensive when they see something slightly inapropate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up.      In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have large mass of imformation to choose from becasue there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of cruiosity. For example somethings like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be consided dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1 we learn the ways of atoms and  make make perdictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous enviroment. The same goes for @CAPS1, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these @CAPS3 we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous.     With everything that we do there is postive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strickly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it apears very useless.      In this large world there alway was and always will be people or material that are a bad influnce. Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different torances and values. With this on going problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our ablities, based off of our values",4,4,4,2
3006,2,"A book is more than words or happenings; they're adventures and stories that travel from one person to another. I find it amazing how someone from one country could write a book, then someone from another country could read it. Inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books, music, and movies; I believe things like that help shape us into who we are today.      There are many problems with entertainment today in my oppinion. They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy; which @MONTH1 not be fit for some people.  I don't think they should take them off the shelves, but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect. Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them. While some of it is not appropriate, other parts of it guide us. It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst, but are hoping for the best. We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment, and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake.       I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams. If we see that one person can do it, we think, why can't I? Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted? Entertainment pushes that concept, but adds everything in it to show the reality of it. Whether these things have offense or harsh contents to them, they still prepare and help us to battle through everyday life.",3,3,3,1
3009,2,"Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be removed from certain library shelves because people have enough sense on what they are interested in and what they are not interested in.  There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is, so censorship does not really make a difference to the individual.  Censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for.       Censorship is not entirely necessary because people will always find something that they are not exactly looking for or interested in.  People's interests are their own business without the censorship of others in the surrounding community.  I've read a couple books that have cussing in them, but the book is still as good as it would be without the cussing in it.  People like things no matter what, because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books, music, and movies.  Books, music, and movies all have much interest from the common person, and each individual is capable of making their own decisions based on what they are interested in.  The individual does not need edited objects, or music to listen to the music or other objects without being offended.  There is something offensive to people in every work that has been published, and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something.     Censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for.  People will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is, so why is censorship such a big deal?  Censorship is not needed in today's society because each specific individual is capable of making their own decision in what's best for themselves.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is.",3,4,3,1
3013,2,"A book represents a person's beliefs and feelngs about a topic. Therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech. I do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it @MONTH1 be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again. A person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it. If we do not accept other people beliefs, we are just as prejudice as the books we are trying to censor.      Many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the holocaust. I think we have the right to know about important events. For one reason, if we forget about such things, than they are more likely to be repeated. Do we really want the murder of millions of people to be repeated? Just becaused we are ashamed of something dosen't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to stike again like a hungry alligator. Instead books about prejudice events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act.     While some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people @MONTH1 find it offensive. There is a much easier solution that censoring those books. The offended groups should just ignore the book. If it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it. The book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast. It should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can.     The main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds in offensive. However, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive? To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly. If that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others. Another big target for censorship in some countries is the @CAPS3. Censoring that book would basically tell the @CAPS4 population that they are wrong.     Censoring something is wrong. Not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book. While some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties. The simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decid if they should read it, or not.",4,4,4,2
3017,2,"Writing is a way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page. In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive.      The @CAPS1, a book written by @PERSON2, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among @CAPS2 because of its content. However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, @PERSON2 exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it.     Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves. It is important for a student to read @ORGANIZATION1, and the works @PERSON4 and @LOCATION1. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come. They must learn how to become successful in life. They should read works by @PERSON1, such as @CAPS3, which essentially tells the story of success and what seperates the average from the great. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else.     Reading is the best way to learn. In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' No book should ever be taken off the shelves. Never",4,4,4,2
3019,2,"From many thoughts and arguments people disagree with the school libraries. The main reason is because of the books, magazines, ariticles, and internet that contains content very disturbing for children. Such content requires material as violence, drugs, and nudity. In this argument, parents do not like the fact that their kids have resources to uncensored content. Or perhaps the parents do not care about what their children have access to.        Today libraries are not focused on the materials that they have on their shelves. That is how children could get the idea in being a 'bad kid' in school. They think it is cool seeing someone else doing drugs, violence, or nudity. But if the libraries have censored content in the library, then kids would not enjoy it if they would have uncensored content. In the parents thoughts, uncensored content should be kept away from children.      The libraries should be more responsible with the content that they have on their shelves. They either do or do not know that they have offensive content in their library. They need to remove all offensive and uncensored content from their shelves for the children. It is not right for the kids to see any offensive or uncensored material.           Their are parents who have kids in school, who do not care about what they learn or what they do. Parents should be more concerned about what their kids are learning everyday. Then they can at least teach their childern about uncensored content.      Parents and libraries should be more responsible about the offensive content that the children could possibly have access to. Children should not see any of the content because it is not right for a child. The falt goes to the parents and the libraries. They should be aware of the material that the children are looking at",4,4,4,2
3020,2,"Do you want your nine year old @CAPS2 talking and reading about inappropreite subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my @CAPS2. I think books that are offensive and inappropreite shouldn't be in @LOCATION1 school or elementray schools with little ones or even @NUM1 years olds. And parents should be in conrol of what thier kids watch and listen too.     Honstley we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them. Its the parents that are the only ones who can control thier children, no one else.     In libraries I feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropraite enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that @NUM1 year olds shouldn't be reading.     Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have @DATE1 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or @CAPS4. And it should have parents permisson on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be aloud to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school.          All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason thier kids are immature and rude because they @CAPS1 thier children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book, etc.     But what about @CAPS4 theaters you ask? DONT @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 TO THE @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school @CAPS3 to the @CAPS5 after school with friends and get in to see rated @CAPS7 movies @CAPS6 parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake @CAPS8 so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will @CAPS3 home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the @CAPS4. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and disapline thier students. I've seen to many parents letting thier children get away with thier mouth and attitude. Most of my friends parents @CAPS1 thier children get away with everything.      One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents and they eaither say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life. But I don't @CAPS1 books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the edicational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends. Its the real world, the adult world.     So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things. Why kids are acting the way they are. Libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them. Please think about what I have said and thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this",4,4,4,2
3030,2,"Books, music, movies, magazines, and more are a good way to learn. Some of that material is bad though, but some is good. Not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same.     Books, newspapers, and magazines are good things, and they could be bad things. Some talk about nonfiction and some fiction. Others talk about famous people and all the good and mainly bad things they did this week, which is something some of us want to read but none of us should read or even write in the first place. Then there are books that have a childs story in them. There are also articles that everyone should read about, like somebody who saved a whole lot of people on @DATE1. There is a diverse amount of things to read out there, you just need to use a little discretion about what to read and put out on the shelves at a public library.     Music is another good way to express yourself. There is good old fashioned @CAPS1 music such as @ORGANIZATION1. Then there is stuff that nobody should listen to, or for that matter even sing about like almost all @CAPS2 Music. They also have little childrens songs which no matter how annoying that most of it is, it's alright for anyone to listen to. Or you can pick up some good ol' @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or any other christian artists or gospel music.The music of this world is very diverse.     The movies of today can, but most of the time aren't,be  good things. You could pick up an educational video that talks about animals that most everyone could watch. There are also bad movies such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6.It is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days. Those are some that nobody should even produce.There are video copies of television shows as well, which can be alright. The vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someones mind but some are good and educational.     So in conclusion, I think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this. Libraries everywhere should have most everything there is.Next time your in a library, just use discretion",4,4,4,2
3036,2,"Who cares about unsensored things anyway? Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened. There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as i can remember. Now everyone is suppose to share there opinons on pulling these offensive books off the shelve?     What is the differnce between someone saying somthing offense or writing it? Ok, so maybe you dont want your child reading somthing unsensored, but the chances are some other child will say somthing unsensored around him. If there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading, why would it of been published? Publishers do read the books they publish them, they will not publish any random thing. I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone. If you cant be mature enough to take a article, book, or magizine seriously, then you dont need to be reading it anyway.                                         In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school. That isnt because of unsensored things, why dont they blame it on parents and ask where they were at? Parents look at anyone and everyone, but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or somthing. It is never the parents fault.                                             If people pull unsensored things out of the library it will serve no purpose and thats just my opinion. I know that i have no say in it and thats ok i can still believe that i am right. Thank you for your time",3,3,3,1
3037,2,"When you were a child how much did you learn from books?  Books are filled with great stories of far-away lands, accounts of real events, and poems with powerful meanings.  All of those books were written by an author with a clear point to make. Those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive.  Children have to learn these things some time in their life and I think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life.  There are also freedoms in the @LOCATION1 that grant us freedom of speech.  Shouldn't there be a freedom to read as well?     Authors are brilliant people.  Without them, there would be no books for anybody to read.  We should all respect authors and what they put into their books.  This means when an author believes that a certain word or action fits in a book, we should leave that book alone and respect what the he or she chose to put in it.       When I was a child I picked up on everything.  I was a very inquisive as any kid my age would be.  I remember wandering around my public library scanning the rows of books and reading the titles.  There were books about politics, religion, sex, and violence.  However on the other side of the library, there were books about children escaping their own world and traveling through time in a magical tree house.  There were even stories about mice who had feelings and normal conversations amongst themselves!  The library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books.  As I grew older, I began to dwelve into more adult books such as politics and religion.  I then formed my own personal opinions on what I gathered from the books.  Without those books in that library I would have never been able to research those topics.     There is an amendment in our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 that  promotes freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1.  This allows for anybody to say whatever they please as long as they don't infringe upon the @CAPS2 of anybody else.  The definition of library is a place where people can read and check out books from library and return them when they please.  Libraries should allow every book in their collection because every book has some sort of value.       Taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them.  Some books @MONTH1 have material that might not belong in the hands of children.  Children need to learn those things sometime in their life.  Why not now?  Books are what have taught all of us.  Please let them keep teaching",4,4,4,2
3041,2,"There are many books that are offensive to people. I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children.There is alot of material out there, weather its books, movie, and other things that have a bad influences on children. Children learn by watching and observing. They learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences.     First, children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another. Some movies even show people having sex. What kind of influence is that on the children. Than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing. Teen pregnacies have jumped threw the roof. High @CAPS1 are filled with pregnant teens. Any where you go I garentee you will see a pragnant teen. Some girls even get pragnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids. Now imagine if we were able to stop that. Theres a way; dont let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted.     Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it. This could be a very bad influence. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place. Well the children will learn from those video games and movies. They think that killing someone is ok and you can get away with it. Bad influences like that make the children think it's ok to do things like that.There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game. Then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school. Is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong. We need to take imediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone.        Finally, all the children are getting lazier. All children do is lay down and watch tv or play video games. Their lazyness causes obesity. Their are many kids to whom this topic refers to. No parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons. Children being obeast causes lots of depression. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem. Thechild then becomes shy and quiet. In some cases the child trys to comit suicide because otherchildren are teasing them in school everyday. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late.      In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophies their has to be change. Their are many harmful and bad influences out their today that can determine the childrens futures. There still time for change, so lets do something about it. Lets try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influencial video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day get up go outside and go for a walk. These are little things we can do to make a change for good",4,4,4,2
3044,2,"I don't Believe in censorship of libraries. Were @CAPS1 we live in a free country, and have the right to have access to the matrial we want from libraries. It doesnt matter if its age aproprite or not. If you dont want your kids listening to that bad rap artist, or watching that @CAPS2 rated movie, then its your responsibility as a parent to keep it from them.     Part of what makes @LOCATION1 so great is the freedom that come with living here. If we allowed anyone to censor a library then we would have no books to read, movies to watch, or music to listen to. Katherine paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hompe none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' this quote shows that if anyone had the right to pull a book from the shelf we wouldnt have any books left.     Censorship would just be the start.It could lead to the government censoring information from the public that they don't want us to know. which would take away the greatness of @LOCATION1, we wouldn't be free.     Censorship of libraries would take away our rights. witch is why i apose it",3,3,3,1
3051,2,"The library is a pathway to knowledge, which branches to many different cultural roads. It has expanded from just a place of books to a building which also houses music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media. But, there begs the question if certain materials should be excluded if they deemed to be offensive. There are many ways to approach this question.     Is censorship an answer to offensive materials or an answer to what is not 'politically correct'? Often, people will claim certain work to be unjust without understanding the viewpoint of the supposed victim. It is quite ironic that the people with the power - who stand up for offended parties - often do not understand them more than the creator of the work.      Another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material, which is very understandable. But, where in the process do parents have control of what exactly they want their children to access. I believe it is the resposiblity of the parent to determine such restrictions. If a parent gives a child unlimited access to material at a library, then the child should be able to explore wherever their curiosity takes them. If the parent chooses to limit access, then they should be active in the process of selection. It is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided.     I myself am a musician, which is no more artistic in a sense than any other creator, such as an author. My creations are expressions that I give for world to enjoy and think about. To remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts. Of course, there are other outlets to acquire books, but the library is one of the greatest outlets.     There are a couple complications that will arise in censorship on libraries. What guidlines do you have in determing excluding the offensive materials? If a material offends one person, is that sufficient enough to exclude it, or do you need a larger group? It is unrealistic to always get a complete consensus of a group's opinion, so how do you determine whats offensive and whats not.            In all, I believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library. It is an institution that is allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live. Its ability to do such should not be compromised.",4,4,4,2
3053,2,"Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for childeren to get ahold of?  A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on @CAPS1?  It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or @CAPS1 show?  I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech.     In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, its going to bring out some violence between some people.  Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels.  That is how @CAPS3 even came to be.  So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it.  There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completly.       If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech.  Some materials out there @MONTH1 be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid it.  It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by.  If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything. So what is the point we all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone.  In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech.     Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was.  If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is.  So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it.  It will still be around.  It is just something in our world that we have to live with",3,3,3,1
3059,2,"Censorship is the idea of blocking or removing things that are  offensive to peoples belief's, their religion, their race and just their ways of life. Therefore, i do not belive that books in libraries should be censored. I understand that things that people write can be offensive to yourself or others, but what if you found a book that was descriminating someone elses belief's but not yours. Would that still be okay with you to take those book off of the shelves?Also, taking books out of a library is not going to stop kids from learning about things that are not age approprite. If you do not want your child learning about them do not let them get it. You censor what your child reads and do not punish the people who go into the library and need the book.           There would be no more libraries if people really wanted to start taking books off the shelf for being offensive. Some people in this world would just take the matter too far and get offended by everything. The things that people will read in books or magazines and see in movies is nothing compared to what they will see in the real world. So if anything, the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people only show you that you will not like everything that someone writes or says.           As far as movies, they are already rated on a decent scale. If it is not age approprite, then do not watch it, or let your children. The same applys for video games and music. Censor them from your children, and do not get them censored from the whole world.      That is my opinion about censoring things from libraries. Just because you do not agree with every little thing that someone writes, does not mean that someone else in the world does not. Out of all the things that need to be censored the library is not one of them. Of all the places, taking things off of the library  shelves is not going to do justice of what really needs to be done",3,3,3,1
3060,2,"Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason. The first reason being  what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is.     The first reason is that what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. In this society we live in we shouldn't go base on ones option because everybody has a right to freedom of speech. History show that many different people found different thing to be offensive because some people think that book that haves gays shouldn't be in books, but many feel otherwise.That a good example on how people have different opition.     The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it. Infact some books teach us that we shouldn't get offfensive because that what one person feels and at long as your got someone who love you it doesn't matter.     The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. Books are a way for someone to give there own point of veiw if you dislike it don't take offensive to it and try to removed it from the shelves. The @LOCATION1 has a government where they take everybodys opition. A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue we shouldn't just removed the school because someone doesn't like it.     In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it @MONTH1 not be to someone else. Next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is.",4,4,4,2
3062,2,"Many @CAPS1 have different opinions about what's appropriate and what's not. It's depends on one's beliefs and morals. I personally don't think that there should be any censorship in libraries.     I think that @CAPS1 should have the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to. Each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe. It also depends on a person's age and maturity level. Some parents let their kids watch certain movies that maybe other parents wouldn't. The situation is different for each person.     It's hard to judge certain materials because some @CAPS1 might find it acceptable while others might not. There would be contraversy over virtually everything because everybody has different standards of what's acceptable what's not, and these standards would clash with each other. It would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to @CAPS1. If someone finds something offensive, then they don't have to check it out.     I also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument. For example materials can be catorgorized by maturity level. That's what movie ratings are for. Materials should be organized that @CAPS1 can easily see if they would be offensive or not. For example all the kids movies and books can be put together so that way parents don't have to worry about their kids seeing or reading something that would be inappropriate. It should be obvious to @CAPS1 who would find it offensive and who wouldn't      @CAPS1 should have the individual freedom to make decisions for themselves. A library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want. Just because somebody finds a book offensive, that doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to read it. That being said, certain things can be done so that @CAPS1 would know if something would be offensive or not.",3,3,3,1
3067,2,"How would you feel if you were at your local library and you found something with something offensive in it? Many people would not approve of having offensive materials in their library. The library is open to anyone and anyone could see the material. Library's should make sure there isn't anything offinsive in their materials before they put them on the shelf.         Everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there. A lot of stuff that can be found in your library could be offensive; but how would people know what is offensive and what isn't? Library's shouldn't have that accessable. If they still have it in your library, then it should have a warning on it or be on a high shelf. Library's should be aware of what they are putting on the shelves and know if it is appropriate or not.         Furthermore, children also have access to the public library. Most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them. If there is something offensive in a child's reach, they might grab it and see whats in it. Most librarys have a childrens section where you can trust that there isn't anything offensive in it. Not all children will just go to the childrens section so there shouldn't be offensive material in library's or at least in childrens reach.         Lastly, librarys choose what they put on the shelves and they never know who will look at it. If there is offensive material in their stuff then anyone can see it and it could put a negative thought in some peoples heads. There are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material but there are others who can't. Thoes that can't, it @MONTH1 reflect something negative on them and it @MONTH1 cause problems. Therefore, there should not be offinsive material in librarys.     In @CAPS1, librarys should not supply offinsive material. If there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material. There shouldn't be access to that in your library because everyone can see it and you don't know how it will effect them. If there is going to be offinsive material in your library there should be an adult area where only people over the age of @NUM1 can enter. If there is something offinsive that is open to anyone, hopefully one day librarys will elimanate them.",4,3,4,2
3071,2,"Definately not, they @MONTH1 be offensive to some but not all. Everybody will be projected to offensive material sometime in their life, so their is no real reason to censor materials. These materials are made to entertain someone, some are entertained by offensive material. I honestly dont think that anything in the library is so offensive that it needs to be took out.      If any material offends you, you dont have to acknowledge it, you can always check out different material. If censor material then you are going against the first amendment, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. Everyone will find something offensive about a certain material and demand it gets taken off the shelf or censored, what happens when every book has been marked as offensive? We have no books, thats what.          Books are made by the author writing down his idea's and creating a plot, some will think his idea's are offensive but not all will. Whether people think its offensive or not people still enjoy those books. Anyone can create material and share their idea's, those idea's could still be offensive but it doesnt matter, because we have @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 to say whatever we want and to not be prosecuted by it. If you ban any type of material, your prosecuting the voice of the creator's opinions, then all your doing is denying the @NUM1 amendment & being a hypocrite.      Censorship of music and movies is not right either. When you censor movies and music your also censoring out their idea's. Music is an expression of life and censoring that would be like censoring emotion. Censorship of the movies, music, & books is just prohibiting the expansion of culture. All im saying is censorship is destroying america and hurting our progression in culture.",4,4,4,2
3072,2,"Have you been to a library and saw no books or magazines on the shelfs? Well if the libraries try taking away all the books and magazines that are offensive then there wouldn't be anything there to read. If you pick up a book or magazine and you think it offends you then don't read it, grab a knew one. through out this article you will hear about how movies can be offensive, and how libraires shouldn't empty their shelves over it, then my belief against this topic.     Movies, books, magazines and music can be offensive. If you think about it though if you get offended then don't read or listen or watch it. You just simply have to grab a new book. Now the question comes, what if its the best book or movie up there? If thats the case then watch it but just know its your own choice to. If you really want to get those books, movies, etc., off those shelves then grab one that just really offends you and take it to the manager and ask him/her to read it or you read a part to them. If he/she don't she a problem with it tell him/her to read from your perspective and then think about it. After you get done with that ask him/her wants a stack of the books, etc., that offend you. Thats when you start piling up the stacks right in front of him/her.     The libraries on the other hand if your getting bombarded with people coming in and sayin this books offends me I can't belive this on your shelves, what if a little kid got ahold of this.......!  Managers or owners if you get people coming in to tell you to read this book, watch this movie. What do you do? In my opinion i'd read or watch maybe the first two or three but after that i'd start playin it off and just agreeing to get them out of your office. Now you gotta think, man if all these people keep coming in here and saying these books, movies, etc. are offensive then you really got to take action. If you take books away from the libraries then you loose sales. I've been to a lbrary where everything was catagorized so people know what there looking through before they start reading which is what I think all libraries should do instead of just putting them out on the shelves.     My belief on the topic is that you go into a lbrary knowing whats in a lbrary, books! Now if you go in there and theres a book or movie that alot of people complained about then i'd see them making an effort to get rid of it. But if your the only one then i highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it. You also got to think the author of the book didn't write it just to offend you, their not singling you out.If its that bad where you can't read or watch it without something setting you off then take it back ang grab a new one. If that book or movie is their best seller they're not going to destroy it because of one single person. So if you go to a library and check out a book or movie without knowing whats it about then I wouldn't blame them for not doing anything about it, its your choice not theirs.     This article took alot of diffrent sides which is good in a way because its not just about one single topic. However if you keep nagging on the manager to get that book or movie out of there and they still don't do it then go to a different library. Maybe that library wont have as many books, movies, magazines, etc., to get offended about and if there is maybe they will be cool about the situation and try fixing the problem to benefit the two of you. So if you read this article and get offended by it then sorry, just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems. thanks for reading",4,4,4,2
3083,2,"Do you believe that certain things need to be taken off the shelf that's uncensored for my children to see.No, I honestly do not because the library shouldn't have no uncensored things put up on the shelves that our children might not see.Cause the staff shouldn't let the children in that area without a parent were the uncensored books, magazines, movies, music and etc.      But it's know ones fault because the media staff that works in the library shoudn't allow the younger kids to go in that area were those things are unless their guardian are with them. Unless they allow them in the area were the books, movies, magazines, etc.The kids should have a certain part of the library were they can take books from that's inappropiate for them.     There's alot of books that children shouldn't be able to read but they read anyways without adults permission.And yes their some books,that's not inappropiate for the little ones and the big kids.Thing's like that is offensive toward the parents how the staff just let them read in see things like that in the parents wonder why, an how there children learning things like that.     Certain things should be posted for things that kids shouldn't be able to see an read and do.And yes I have the right to say something to the staff for letting my child read, see things their not suppose to see.They know those things not appropiate for them so why would they let them watch or do or see stuff like that.     My conclusion yes I think certain things that don't suppose to be were they suppose to be for young children to see.That's not right to let them see things like that. So that's why I'm writing this essay to the newspaper arguing on whats right for allowing them to see uncensored things they are not to see",3,3,3,1
3084,2,"Do you believe certain books should be removed from the shelf because they are offensive? From my point of view yes, because libraries are public which means they are open to any and everyone. Kids could see a photo that @MONTH1 not be appropriate for them, people of different religion could hear foul language, and it could give some libraries a bad image. I can relate to this because I have also heard some things that I am not proud of such as foul language. That effected me because when I heard it I went around people who were positive in my life saying it to them.     Of course, this could effect a child in a negative way. Kids grow up to be as positive as they can, atleast thats what parents teach them and if they get hooked on things they see they will try to immitate it. From my experience it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline. But if a child is not taught that those things have bad effects they will learn the hard way. This is a reason I wish censorship was in our local libraries.     Also, people of different religion could find it offensive. We have different consumers that walk in and out of the library everyday, so when they enter they should find it peacful not the opposite. For example a muslim could walk in the library and here others listening into music with nothing but profanity. Now that person has the right to report that person who was listening to it and he can say the library has no restrictions. At times it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words but the library needs to know their limits.     Then, the library has a bad image which is a big problem. When something gets a bad look sooner or later it will not be there anymore. Meaning consumers will stop going to that library and one thing could lead to another. For example when you leave the library the people that work there want you to come back and tell other people about their library. But if problems constantly happen there they will leave and tell their friends this is not a good library. Then those figures add up then finally you struck out and it's gone.          Now, if they are not removed this is what can happen. Children will immitate what they see or heard, complaints will be filed on that library. If I had a problem with the restriction levels at the library I just would stop going. And if that library can not help it atleast have the courtesy to mark the sections of the library. This will make sure we will know what we are about to see and read",3,3,3,1

Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with astrics.  Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway.      If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it?  Most of those people would, and get angry when their work is edited.  They want their work to be heard, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words.  This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different then what it was originally supposed to mean.      However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music?  Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand.  Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things.      In conclusion, cenorship should just be ignored.  Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines.

And what about the parents the parents if they need to found some information about a book, or they just wanted to read and they found offensive stuff, the parents are going to get mad, not all the parents right but some parent will.and they maybe are not going to came back again.I never experience something like this in my life @CAPS1 in my school and the library that i go they don't have anything offensive or inapropiated. that's why a respect the people for the library and for the school, @CAPS1 they respec us too. tha's why i never go to places that i don't know.Supose i go to a library that i don't know and i bring my parent and my little brother right and this library have offensive materials, my parents are going to get mad with me, they are going to said that if i don't have respec, and that i bring my brother to a innapropiated place they are going to be mad with me, that i bring my family to a offensive place, and is not my foul right.And those are my opinions why",3,3,3,1
3101,2,"No, i do not think that books, magizines, movies and music should be removed. However, I do think that the books, magizines, movies, and music should be monitred by age. The reason why is because younger children sould not be reading , listening, or watching material that is for adults or teenagers.       They way these type of things can be monitred is by the child's library card. The card could have their name, age, grade, and date of birth. If there is a certain book, magizine, movie, and music that the child want a parent has to be there with them. The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librian knows that the parent  is of age.           Teenagers should also be moniterd. Event though they are almost adults. Some parents @MONTH1 not agree with some of the material. So, if their parents does not want them reading certain things their should be stickers on their cards.

3111,2,"The right to remove a book off of a shelf is not good thing to do. My view on the subject is that, if this begins there will only empty shelfs in librarys across the country. Once the removing of books start there will be hardly any left.     We use books everyday, for students we use them to learn and for a entertainment during someclasses. Books help us learn things, like new words we've never heard of before, or some major point in history we should know about. Even as adults some of them like to read in there free time.     I think its wrong to remove a book off of the shelf, just because a few or a bunch of people think its inaproprate. If it is the librarys should have section for those books that dont let the little kids go in that section. their is a problem for this idea, what books should go into this section of the library? A way to solve that question would be to elect a nation wide library service to set it up and have people vote on which books to to remove or put into a speacial section in the librarys across the nation. This idea goes the same for everything found at a library.     Another soulution to this matter is that, the librarys across the nation have another labeling system like the dewey decimal system but use both. this new system could contain information like reviews from crtics about the book, or what happend during the book. This would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so.     The books, music, magazines found in librarys should be left their for a reason.

3119,2,"There are more than six billion people in the world. That means there are over six billion different personalities and opinons of all these distinct people. It would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive, because almost everyone is offended by something. Some media can be found more offensive than others, but its likely that its something that the author feels passionate about and the author could be offended if his opinon was rejected. Now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world. Media that used to only be found on the shelves is now displayed online, which can never be permanently removed from public view. It's illogical to think that just removing materials from libraries would prevent different groups of people from being offended by the media.     There is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness. Some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type a culture and raise awareness about the subject. However, there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe. So, it is in those authors best interest to take into account the people they are writing about. It's important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful. There is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational. If a person is offended by something someone wrote, they should just avoid reading it. However, this does not give authors the power to target a group in their writing and offend them specifically.      This is a very two-sided subject. It can not strictly be controlled by censoring libraries; it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere. Authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending. In regards to this, readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them, and avoid conflict by avoiding the material. It is not right by any means to target and offend a group of people in a piece of literature; however, this is a practice that has been done before and just remvoing the materials from the shelves won't stop it from being exploited.      Libraries are already decreasing severly in their reveleance in the world. All the new technology has hurt them and its not likely that they will ever become more prominent than other reasources, like the internet, again.With this in mind, how much would censoring libraries really help those offended groups in the world? Most likely, they would not even notice a change. Everyone has the right to have an opinon and share it, but it is important to keep the feelings of others in mind as well. The world is overflowing with different media that many people have access to, so writers and producers need to think outside of themselves before putting it on the shelves.",4,4,4,2
3120,2,"What is offensive to you? See your answer might be different from the person sitting right next to you. There are so many materials in the world that are found to be offensive. The world wouldnt be any different if we were to pull all of these offensive materials off the shelves. There wouldnt be anything left because everyone has their own opinion about something and everyone has different inferences about what's offesive to them. I believe that offensive material shouldn't be removed from the shelve.       Everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off the shelf. There is always something wrong with something. @CAPS1 might be the way someone has said something or the way they mean't @CAPS1 by. There is always that one person out of the bunch who has something negative to say. Either they take @CAPS1 the wrong way or they just think @CAPS1's wrong.      Everyone has their own opinon about everything. Same for when some one asks you whats offensive to you. Someone else @MONTH1 say that what you find offensive, is no where near offensive to them. For instance, my grandpa loves all type of music and his life revolves aroud music. My grandma doesnt like some of his music because she says ' @CAPS1 doesn't sit right with me,' meaning that she doesn't believe in some things that the music is trying to persuade people to do. My grandpa really doesn't pay attention to the lyrics as much as my grandma does, because he doesn't see music in that kind of way. My grandpa likes a lot of music because of their rhythm and beat. They always kind of get into disagreements about music they want to listen to because my grandma finds something in the music thats offensive to her beliefs, but my grandpa doesn't. @CAPS1 doesnt effect him as much as her.     If you were to go around and ask people whats offensive to them, their would be some many different answers and you could never sum @CAPS1 all down to one answer. With only a couple of people feeling offensive to some things, but the majority find @CAPS1 different, that would ruin @CAPS1 for everyone almost. Then that would almost be everything gone cause @CAPS1's always that one person that takes @CAPS1 the wrong way and has to feel offended. So I still believe that offensive materials shouldn't be pulled off shelves.",3,4,3,1
3123,2,"I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent. There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library, but some of it could be useful.     There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library. When I went home to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive, not to mention awkward and embarassing. My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie '@CAPS1'.      Although there are some materials that should not be in the library, there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes. Some people think gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive. There @MONTH1 be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives. Somebody @MONTH1 have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman @MONTH1 be thinking about recieving an abortion. What is offensive to some, @MONTH1 not be offensive to others.     I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials. If it is educational, it @MONTH1 be useful to some people. There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world. As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world.",4,4,4,2
3124,2,"Have you ever been offended by a movie, book, song, or magazine? Did you have a choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item? The question that seems to be of intrest to people is should these items that are offensive be taken off the shelves. I don't think they should.     I am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine and all of them could give an example. I doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad. If something offends you, don't read or watch it. If you don't want your kids watching something, don't let them. You can make that desicion. No one is making you watch or read any of that.     I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have. I've even read some books that are not the best, but I choose to read them. No one forced the act on me.     Some of you @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS1 about at school?' If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then take it up with the teacher. They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book. They might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature.     There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there. If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left. The shelves would be bare.     You have a choice to read or watch something. If it is offensive don't watch it. Everyone has different views on that book or movie. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show. I don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be taken off the shelves.",4,4,4,2
3129,2,"Just because I agree with something, do you have to agree too ? Your cousin believing in one thing,means you have to believe in it also? No,not in my opinion, and I hope not in yours either. If you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you? The world contains things that children agree with and parents do not and this world consists of things that you like and others will not, but that does not make that item or that object invaluable or offending, and not the least bit inappropriate.      Objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while. They are going to be everywhere;in stores , in schools, inside, outside , they are all around, and there is no reason for them to be a problem. They will not disappear and that is nothing we want to have to worry about,that could become a criminal offence of any sorts. So why fight it,well I say we don't.      Do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended? What if something you liked ,was of an offence to another , does that make it all the more wrong for you to like it? Almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions. Nothing in this world exists without opinions. Life in itself can be an opinion.      I believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by one,it is not deemed offensive by all. Nothing should be removed from a shelf or a rack because another doesn't agree with it. Substitute other objects or ideas with this, if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race? No, I sure hope you would not, but to some they @MONTH1 see that as their one resolution. Well me, I do not, and I'm a strong willed, strong opinionated person and to me that is all wrong.      Anything published or released to the world, to the public by someone means that is their way of expressing something, it is their way of living, and they have that right. That is who they are, and that is what they like,that is another person , anything we see or hear in this world is someone else because that has come from an individual who is equal to us,so why lessen there equivalence because its not the same way I feel? We @MONTH1 not all agree with their way of life, we @MONTH1 not agree with their choice of clothes, but how are we to know if we agree with their way of heart? No characteristic dictates the other characteristics of another,so why should an item?      A good thing to you could be a bad thing to another, and what if that disappeared? Taking a cd off a shelf will not vanish it from the world, it could be found somewhere else, but still that is like eliminating your hand because your fingers don't look like mine. Nothing can justify removing things from the stores and the world because one group of people don't understand it enough to feel the same and agree with it. Anything could be deemed inappropriate,but what if your vision of appropriate is anothers eye to inappropriate. Maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriate,especially in the world we live in today.     If we start eliminating and removing everything we don't like, we would have nothing left, any and everything could be gone within a week or a month. People would take an inch to a mile , and erase everything, then we would start eliminating people we do not like , and it would all become a repeat. We learn about our history for a reason, does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through? Erasing things from lives,have done no good before. If we start listening to the facts of people not agreeing with one thing, we will listen to the next, what happens when all the sudden the people come in again and say they do not like the women with blonde hair or the men with green eyes? The world will crash and burn before our eyes, and if I can identify these things at the age of fifteen, then some need to identify things at the age of fifty, accept that the world has its flaws too.      So just because I agree with everything I said , are you going to agree with it also? No I know you will not,but think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think. When I think of people reducing the things that they do not like, I can already see the world losing it's pathetic value it has earned, and we @MONTH1 not all be fond of this world but we cannot lose it. Eliminating the things you do not have a fatuation with will do no good, so maybe we should take into acceptance the different people we've been blessed with and love what we have. Accept the world as it is,because it is what you live in and it is what you have,because with out it nothing would be anything.Attempt to fix the broken things not eliminate the jagged things",4,4,4,2
3131,2,"Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring. Walking up and down isles looking at all of the books, and wishing that they were all more interesting. Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours, you get a glimpse of a very interesting title. Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page. Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it?     Profanity, nudity, and crude humor, as well as many other things, are all over the media, including books. Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply cannot watch, listen to, or read certain things. The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see, hear, or read these things, other than, 'it is bad, and I said no.' If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things, the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things.     Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things, but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't. And if a child is too young to see, hear, or read certain things, than they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent.      Censorship, in my opinion, should not be done by libaries, movie producers, television programs, and record companies, it should be done by the parents of a child.",4,4,4,2
3133,2,"To begin with I feel everyone should admire the libraries. I feel this way because at one point of time we didnt even have books let alone libraries to get books from. A library is a place that has a peacful and calm environment. People come to hang out at the library to collect good books, surf the internet, check out new music and aslo to relax.    So to answer the question 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the selves at the library if found offensive?' @CAPS1, I believe if things are on the shelf that @MONTH1 come off offensive to people they should absolutely be removed. You shouldn't have to be in an environment were things are offending you. If things seem to come off offending, it will make indivuals stop coming to the library. This will make the library loose alot of business due to lack of service.    The library should be a place that consist of love, peace and harmony. It should be a place were people should feel free and relieved from any stress. By seeing or hearing something that comes off very offensive will tend to bring confusion to the library. This also will make the librarians job much harder than what it should be. They will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library.  Something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry. Certain types of music shouldnt be found in a library. An  example of some offensive music is the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' music, meaning the music with all types of different profanity. The music that is degrading women in a very disrespectful manner. Also the music that's making it seem cool to be violent.    This will come off offensive to many men and women. Think about it who wants to listen to music thats makes women feel like their not worth anything and who wants to listen to music that's always talking about killing, fighting and gangs etc. People whould like to hear more soothing and relaxing music. The music that makes you happy no matter the mood your in. The library should just pick their music wisely so everyone can be well satisfied.  In conclusion as stated the library is a great place to hang out and just to relax. It should never come off as a place with things that is offensive of so it should get removed. This would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is",4,3,4,2
3139,2,"Honestly there's alot of books and magagives that need to be taking off the self. I can remember in the sixth grade going to the schools library and picking up a book that not only told me wha weed was it told me how to grow it! Also alot of book refer to drug and sex now a days and  absolutly hate it! The last book I checked out, even though it is been a while sence ive checked one out, had enough referances to sex that i could honestly say I thought I was read a porn magazine.     Our schools really need to watch what they put onto there selfs. I mean come on sixth graders shouldnt even be able know what weed is! Let alone read about it in school! maybe that why kids get interested in drugs and achole at such an early age. The book I read didnt have any negative satments about the weed. what makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs?     Like I said before alot of book in schools and pubic librarys have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex. They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are, what kind of high it'll give you. And were you can buy the crap to make them!     Ok I know im in highschool but you should have book that seem like pron magazines. The book i read have pictures of postions in it! it broke everything down into details! It even gave websites on the back of the book. And that my friends is not alright. Its just sad.     It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading. Doesn't it scare you? I know I dont want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail. Let alont them reading about it at all. just take the books off the schools and pubic librarys selfs. Hardly anyone will read them anyway. And if they do its by accident like mine incounters where",3,4,3,1
3142,2,"Comics, romance, adventure books, and mystery books are just the few different types of books out there as well as the magazines and music we listen to. With a little bit of everything, and whatever your passion is, we have that right in our local libraries to go look at or hear whatever pleases us but, some of the people that go there are not adults. Some of them are young children who are either checking out a book themselves or are simply with there parent/guardian. I believe that even though there are some books magazines, and music not attended for children, they still shouldn't be removed just because they are found offensive.     Everyone once in their life had to atleast experience something unpleasant. But knowing our world today, we simply can not hide from those things but yet face them, we adults are old enough to just walk away from something we find offensive unlike what our children or other children can do. Sometimes, even children have to go through it as well. It's part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us.      If you already know what parts of the library have stuff children shouldn't see, don't bring your child to that area. And if it's possible, bring them to an area where they @MONTH1 sit and read there favorite books as well with you by there side where you can watch there every move. And at the same time, you don't have to take a chance at explaining something that you are not quite ready or sure that your child is ready to hear or see.      Since it's impossible to hide things from your children that you are not wanting them to see and hear at the same time, that's a part of life. Even if they are still really young and ask what a certain thing is, we can simply turn there heads and make them get distracted by something else and pretend that we didn't hear what they said. But as your children get older, they should know right from wrong and know what things they @MONTH1 read and things they can't.     Some of us are oblivious to the world around us and @MONTH1 not know that certain things can cause more harm than good, even like taking your children to the library. If you don't like a certain thing there or know that there is going to be something you simply do not want your child to see or hear, then don't bother taking them with you on your next visit and go another time when your child is with a babysitter or take a chance into bringing them with you an expect the unexpected when it comes to offensive items at the library",4,4,4,2
3144,2,"Censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear. Although censorship isnt usually a bad thing, it is sometimes over-used. Not everyone has the same views and morals, what @MONTH1 be considered appropriate for some people , @MONTH1 be viewed differently by other cultures or religions.       In my personal opinion if you find something to be offensive, instead of demanding it be removed or censored, simply do not watch, or read it etc. Obviously if the content was published in the first place it appeals to some audience. No one is forceing people to read or watch things, that is why there is something called viewers disgression. If everything that was considered offesive to a certain individual or group where censored , there would be no @LOCATION1. In @LOCATION1, we have freedom of speech, the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose. To censor things out is condraticary to that amendmant.    For example the censorship of useing the word '@CAPS1' in vain on television. I myself find this to be excessive because it doesnt apply to my beliefs . Although the program ' The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6' protrays people of my age and nationality getting pregnant and doing drugs. Even though I find this offensive and sterotypical, instead of demanding it be removed, I simply don't watch it.     I am not saying that I am totally against censorship of certain things, like nudity on television. Although if something is censored simply because of a belief, or moral, or worry for a one's children to be subjected to it,that is blowing censorship out of proportion. If you find something offensive just keep yourself and your children away from it.",4,4,4,2
3145,2,"Censorship in libraries is not necassary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive; then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids @MONTH1 refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to. Censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books.     Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away.     If there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of; keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids. It is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad. That is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different. So again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves.     When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids @MONTH1 just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories @MONTH1 seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids @MONTH1 actually read.     All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss. Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the gurdian of a child",4,4,4,2
3152,2,"I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelve do to something offensive.Libraries are a very important aspect to life for most people nowadays. Mainly because where I live our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby.For, me and my friends the library is very important because we do not have a computer in our home.The library has the internet and older books with information on the city.           Living in the society that we have now not every household can afford a computer with internet.Me myself living in one of those households.The library is a great quiet place to get your work done.Its also, provides the internet that people cant afford and need for everyday life.Every job application or school assignment is no longer on paper ,but online.      Being a @NUM1 grade student we have to alot of projects to do that require old books on the city and history.If they remove certain books of the shelve i @MONTH1 not be able to find important information that I need.Also, I know that every person has their own opinion on what is offensive to them ,however if everyone found something offensive in the book, movie or magazine does that mean it should be removed? If that happened there would be a very limited supply of books.    I have a friend who is mixed with mexican and sometimes she finds slavery very offensive ,but to me I believe that it is important for me to learn about my history.Proving that something that might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive and maybe very important to the other.           In conclusion, I disagree with books being removed from the shelve due to offensive content I believe is wrong.Every person is different and find different things offensive ,but things should not be taken away from another person who @MONTH1 need it",4,4,4,2
3153,2,"Everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want. Sometimes it's not always up to them. For example rated-@CAPS1 movies, most children under @NUM1 cannot watch them. Either its a law or the parents have made it a rule. Music I think is different. Some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing, certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message. Libraries should not have those kind of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people want to view those kind of things that other people find 'offensive' they should buy them on their own time. Not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people @MONTH1 find funny other people get offended by. Even if libraries had anything that would offened someone else, it would be the readers choice to pick a book they want to read.      Sometimes it @MONTH1 be better off if the children read these articles by themselves so it'd save time from having parents explain it to them later. They might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for. For example, when my brother watched a rated-@CAPS1 movie. In my brother's younger years he was always curious and asked a lot of questions all the time. Sometimes my mother didn't know how to respond so she'd change the subject. Well, everyone knows the same old question '@CAPS3 do babies come from?'. That's the kind of question my brother was curious about. My mom never bothered to answer that question, but if she did she would make up some story. My brother was smart enough to know that what he was being told wasnt accurate at all. Finally one day he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking. It happen to have the answer to his question. He was shocked and disgusted at the same time yet he was glad to know he finally found the answer my mom wouldnt give.     In this situation I am somewhat nuetral. I dont object to having things that might offened other people be removed from book shelves but on the other hand it might not be a good thing to put 'offensive' things and certain libraries @CAPS3 children can get to them. Perhaps it's what makes things not boring and makes it more interesting to the reader. Not everyone has the same opinion on things. It just @MONTH1 be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion. Everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either.     The bad thing about having any 'offensive' things in libraries @MONTH1 not be a smart idea if it's @CAPS3 most children get there books. Parentscan always have a say in what kind of book their children read or what kind of movies they watch. Some parents might not want to go through all the questions the children ask and give something to them that will explain it better for there understanding, while other parents dont want their children  to see or know of any sort of things that @MONTH1 be 'offensive' until their old enough to understand it better and are mature about those things. So in some cases it might be bad idea for things that only an adult should know be on book shelves in a library @CAPS3 a child might get ahold of it.     The quotation ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own opinion. The quotation is basically  saying if even a parent doesnt want their child to read something 'offensive' if that parent reads it that sometime their children have a right to know. If the child has tooken anything like that off a shelf that once they know they will not ask anymore questions.",4,4,4,2
3155,2,The censorship in libraries should be as gog as it is for that age group. Children of the age @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be able to read books with any profanity. they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive.     Children that are @NUM3 should not have books in their libraries with much of this pro-found languge. They are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling. They should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this. If they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in.      With children that are younger than @NUM4 years of age they should not read or seee things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them. We cannot controll what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries,3,3,3,1

Just becuase we might not like it doesnt mean theirs somebodyout there that do. Everything shuld be in the library becuase their are different people and not everybody like the same things.      The library suppose to have everything so if we declared to take something off the shelf becuase due to the fact one or a couple more people dont like something or whats being displayed out to people it wouldnt be right. I have been to the library and looking for an movie or a book that i like or want to see and it have not been there i have got mad for that. So ifeel as if it's not right nor fair.

3163,2,"What is this world coming to?  We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out. Being a daughter and teenager myself, I personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines.  The sex, drugs, and violence used to create a story, have destroyed the minds of our youth.  I strongly feel this disturing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries.          I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read.  I agree reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling, but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking.  The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious they become.  I feel they will eventually let curiousity get the better of them.      Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all apart of growing up, but I disagree.  Trying any one of these harmful activites portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe danger.  It only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs.         To better prove my point, think of your favorite book.  Did you look up to any of the main characters? Did you want to be just like him/her?  Well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model.  They @MONTH1 save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well.  This tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite.     I stand by my opinion and believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries.  This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth.  It leads them to believe everyone, including their heros in books and movies, does these things.  Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for",5,4,5,3
3164,2,"People think that graphic images or words are going to change the outlook there younger child has on alot of topics. But really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter? Well according to some people it does which i can understand but i will have to go with the side that it does'nt matter to. Becasue its not like there not going to find out about bad language or sex so i say there should be no restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, tv shows, ect.     The fact of the matter is that people or parents get to offended or complain cause there little @PERSON1 said a curse word in front of them. Or becasue some of the material in the show or magazines are to offensive towards people with disabilities, races, ect. When really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious. Authors works arent to be shunned apon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it.     Through all of this you should know by now that i don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just becasue little kids parents are ashamed of what there kid read. Casue like i already said there are gonna find out about this stuff eventually. So no need getting mad over it. And if we got rid of all the more mature books what  kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read. Casue im pretty sure i dont want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home.",3,3,3,1
3165,2,"Dear @CAPS1,      @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1. I am a student here at @LOCATION1, and it has come to @CAPS2 attention that the @ORGANIZATION1 is thinking about taking books they find offensive out of the library. I think this is wrong. If everybody at @LOCATION1 took the books we found offensive off the shelves and threw them away, we would be left with no books to read.      I also think that no one person should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me to read. I am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make @CAPS2 own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading. If I feel I should read books that others @MONTH1 find offensive then, why does that concern you? Just because I want to read the book does not mean you have to.         Also, I think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting. If you take every offensive word out of a book, chances are it is going to be hard to sit through it. If you take all offensive books from the library, kids will be even more discouraged about reading, and I know that is not what @LOCATION1 is looking to do.     If you think that books are that offensive, try walking down the hallways. this is a @ORGANIZATION1. Kids cuss all the time, and talk about dirtier stuff than in any book I've ever read. If your looking to make children more innocent, then taking all ofour books out of the library is not the way to go about it",4,4,4,2
3168,2,"Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, expicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material.      Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general",4,4,4,2
3179,2,"Do you believe that certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no i do not. it is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completley remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it.     I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. some times storys cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Wether those words be good or bad i feel like with out them the book that is being read is not all of what it could of been. in my oppionion censorship takes away from certain values or qualitys the book could of had with the original context still in it. and to me that is not fair. its not fair to the author. and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book.     I know from my personal expierences with reading books that 'yes' i have read books that have had bad language in them. but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completley taken off the shelf. For example the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being scensored or taken off the shelf for that matter.     All i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. because that is getting away from what the over all message is about. Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No i do not. Neither should you",4,4,4,2
3181,2,"The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time. What I find appropreate, another @MONTH1 find obscene and volgur. What I enjoy to read, or listen to, or watch, or any other manner of media consumption I indulge in, @MONTH1 insult or bother someone else; as a matter of fact it probably does. That still does not make it right to remove what I, or others like because it offends another person.     A child walks through a grocery store, doesn't get what they want and proceeds to drop the f-bomb. More than half the time, they heard that language from their parents. If not their parents, then the media right? Maybe so, but that media shouldn't be hidden for the 'just-in-case' a child hears it. If a parent or guardian does not want their child to hear such things, they shouldn't allow them to listen to it. They control what does and does not enter their house.      To remove such things from the library, would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body, or hearing a curse word. Every time they bathe they'd need blinders from themselves and they'd never be able to leave their house, because people do not always watch what they say in public.      No, I do not feel like every type of movie, or book, etc., belongs in the library. There is a cut-off as to how inapropreate or volgure something should be and still be allowed in a public library. Novels that are so descriptive that the reader can almost see every aspect of the procreation taking place between the pages, should have its own place, seperate from the public library, right along with the movies that really do show every aspect.     Although I like the thought, to actually remove said books would be unfair. To deny access to those who find those books fine for themselves wouyld be wrong. A wise author, Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The truth of this statement would not be hard to prove.      A religious family that believes @PERSON2, a book I find to be innocent fantasy, is a book series promoting witchcraft and satanism, so they remove them from the library. I remove the previously stated graphic romance novels. A mother whom wants her child to be sheltered from what she considers the filth of the planet, removes books of drug addicts, and abuse, and books of war because they're full of death. And as this continues, finally, we are left with the empty shelfs of a forgotten building that no longer has a purpose.      The graphic novels I find inapropreate could be placed in an adult section, or higher up than most children can reach. The protective parents can deny their own children the media they deem inappropreate, instead of the world.     Although not everything is appropreate for everyone, it isn't right to censor something from the world. There are ways to cencor things to parts and not others. Nothing should be romoved from the library because of its content. At most it should be placed in a less accessable manner.",4,4,4,2
3182,2,"There are many diffrent people in this world, who have many diffrent oppions about books, music, movies, magazines, etc., @CAPS1 because one person dose not perticualy like horor movies, that dose not mean that movies stores should remove horor films from there shelves. as creepy as it @MONTH1 sound. there are many people in the world who are slasher film freeks. the live and breath scarry movies. I myself like @CAPS1 about eveything out there. i will read any book of listen to any type of music, it actualy widens my taste in certain materials. i feel like everyone should try new things.

3183,2,"What is consitered offensive? If we took books, music, movies and magazines that people found offensive of shelfs there would be nothing left. Everyone is diffrent which mean they all get offended in diffrent ways. By taking all this off shelfs we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world.          Things we learn about in school, slavery, wars and some pollitics. Now all these things could offend many people but if we were to take them of off the shelfs at school and libraries children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world. What about drugs and alchol, many parents do not talk to their childern about the uses of controlled substances, so without these sources they @MONTH1 never know the harm that they can do to someones body. Everyone takes something offensive but not everyone takes the same thing offensive. So who is to say what offends people and what does not? If thats the case shouldn't we take all books, movies, music and magazines away from childrens schools and libraries? Adults get offended to so would we take all of their resources away also including the newspaper. By taking away what one @MONTH1 call offensive @MONTH1 land us in the dark ages with no books, no local news, no movies, no nothing because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive.   Everyone has the right to read and write what they want. No one can say what offends everyone. Someone @MONTH1 get offended by talking about ones race, another @MONTH1 get offended by talking about @CAPS1 and someone @MONTH1 even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat.

3186,2,"No, I would not think it would be the right thing to do. To just take a book off the shelf just because one person or a small amount of people think that one book is offensive to them. Its not only one person to decide that. People or some people would like to vote or have a meeting about taking a book or books off the shelf cause it's offensive to them.Just because one person finds that book or books offensive doesn't mean that they should have the right to just throw the book away. Thier could be many people out thier that really like that book or those books, and they wouldn't be able to enjoy them anymore. All because one person or a few other people don't like the book.Yes their are books out thier that a lot of people don't like but that still don't give one person to throw the book out, all because they don't like that book or that seires of a book. No one should have the right to just take a book that they don't like out of a libary and throw it out because they don't like it. Their could be a smart little boy or girl that likes that book and because that one person threw it away because they don't like it, now that little boy or girl won't get to read their favorite book. Thats why I don't think books that some one thinks is offensive should be taken out of a libary. Because theirs always some one out their that likes that one book that you might want to throw away. If you think the book is that offensive to you just stay away from that area of the libary and don't think about that book",2,3,2,0
3188,2,"I think that they should remove books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse in worse like everyday, i think they should move the @NUM1 to @NUM2, so atleast they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want, but they should go through and do a self-check on everything that they put out  in the stores.They should also have different parts in a library so that the little ones dont get to the adult section, such as adult books, that have stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that catagory. I have @NUM3 little brothers, and they are @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6. They know more stuff then my parents, and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier. So i say we as in the @LOCATION1 citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of.          When i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday they are coming out with something else everyday that can effect our kids, brothers, or whoever. I also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life. Kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age, they will remember it. Im not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier. I also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up stories so that there kid wont know, they need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now? they whould be more aware of the real life in how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life.                So thats what my person input is on the situation. I wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess.",3,3,3,1
3192,2,"When I go to a library I @MONTH1 find some stuff that is offensive to me. But if somthing is offensive to me the person beside me @MONTH1 not  think the same thing  is offensive to him or her. When people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not . There is a wide variety of people that all have diffrent opinions based on their history.      What I think is offensive @MONTH1 be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed, published, or recorded and other people's eyes. The major problem is that offensive doesn't have a set definition. I don't think that you will ever find a definition that everyone can agree on. There needs to be a limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups. For example you would not want a kindergarder to be able to check out a @CAPS1 movie.      Some censoring has to be done to protect people.But it all comes down to common sense. We won't ever all agree on what is offensive but if we use are common sense the problem @MONTH1 be solved",3,3,3,1
3194,2,"Katherine Paterson said ' If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. ' In this quote I think she was trying to get across that if someone picks up a book or a magazine and reads it and then puts it back and maybe its not the best book ever to them and they @MONTH1 find it offensive, but someone else comes along and wants to read it and they @MONTH1 not find it offensive, then you have two different view points on a book that @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, but to another it @MONTH1 not be. Different view points really effect how to censor books, because of how people are so different, there difference on how they feel about a book could effect what should happen to that book.     I dont believe that books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials such as those should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to someone. If they are found offensive to a bunch of different people then yes they should be removed, but if its only bothering one or two people but there are other people that agree that its not offensive, then dont get rid of it just because of a couple people. Take a vote maybe to see how many people agree and dissagree on keeping or getting rid of it then decide whether or not you should keep or get rid of it off of that vote. I think it would be more fair and satisfactory to take a vote on whether or not it is fair to keep or remove it. If someone has a memory about something they read or remember an experience from it and then someone else reads it and feels offened by something its not fair to the other person to get rid of it. Its especially not fair to the person with the memories and experiences.     So dont  remove books just because a couple people might find it offensive, take a vote to decide. Let more than just a few people deciede on behalf of the book. More than just a few people can make an impact on just one book, and you never know what differnt views you @MONTH1 find from different people on just one book. People need to be able to discuss their veiws on the book and then bedate on whether or not to keep it, so dont choose to get rid of them without several view points on the book.",3,3,3,1
3199,2,"Do we have the right to take books? Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something agaist it then we would hardly have any books at our libraries.        Everyone has their own opinions. There are so many things that effect our opinions. Our beliefs, life styles, way of thinking, culture, and the list goes on. I'm sure I could think of certain books, movies, music, and magazines that I dont like and could just do without. Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials? It sure wouldnt bother me but that would be extreamly selfish. Even if something is totally innopropriate and offensive it is still information. Maybe it shouldnt go in the little kids section of a library or store but i dont think it should be removed completely. Music especially. There are wide ranges of music from rap, rock, oldies, screamo, classical, country, alternative and the list goes on. I dispise country; I go for the alternative and classical music. I know a lot of people who love it though. All the old people i know hate all the rap. Most of it is pretty offensive but thats just how things are.         So no, I dont think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive. We cant hide from the world. I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things. If we remove thing materials we dont care for, others will remove the ones you like and so on. So then were left with nothing. Just like freedom of speech we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what we enjoy",4,4,4,2
3210,2,"You gotta admit, although you would like your kids to have freedom, @CAPS3 all of them are responsible enough to handle @CAPS1. You could blabber in their ear all day about '@CAPS1's responsible to do this and @CAPS3 do this.' and they will go out and do @CAPS1 anyways. Trust me, I'm a teenager. I know. So there are certin things that you have to take away from them in order to keep them from getting distracted on what @CAPS2 matters in their teenage years. And that is schoolwork.     If school systems allowed there to be offensive or innapropriate materials on their shelves, I just know kids would find themselves to be...well... 'distracted'. And when I say innapropriate, I don't only mean on sexual terms, I mean for school. You would like to think that they would possibly save @CAPS1 for when they checked out and went home and did their work first but, like I stated before, kids are going to do what they want. And what they want to do is @PERCENT1 of the time @CAPS3 schoolwork. They would rather just sit down, crack open a magazine, and let their eyes glaze over at the sights of celebrities and new scandals.      School work is a very important thing in teenagers lives, and I feel that when they are in school they should stay focused on schoolwork and activities. If they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines, they should do @CAPS1 at home. Offensive books should @CAPS3 be there to only distract the teenager from school. @CAPS1's unneccesary. But with public libraries, @CAPS1's a whole new story.     I beleive that nothing should be censored from a public library because people go their on their own free will. I know I personaly go there for research and for the sheer joy of reading, as do many other people. @CAPS1's your choice if you are responsible enough to keep focused on work or get distracted because @CAPS3 only do teenagers go there, but adults do too. @CAPS1 is unacceptable for there to be only educational books because who knows what your there for? The library is for people to go and read, whether @CAPS1's just for the heck of @CAPS1 or for school.     @CAPS3 everyone is responsible. Especially @CAPS3 teenagers. So that's why I personally beleive offensive or innapropriate materials should @CAPS3 be allowed in school libraries, but allwowed in public libraries. Although equal rights and freedom in necessary, schoolwork is too important to let kids get distracted from @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is the key to their future",4,4,4,2
3211,2,"All people have the same right to read, listion and watch different materials. To be censored should be no one choise but your own. For some one else to tell you what and what not to read is by my openion very wrong to do. If we would censore everything we did we would have a city and nation that would @DATE1 slowly.   Any givein word can offend any certain person. The people that they offend are in my oppioen are the dead weights of our country that are just holding us back from fully ecpressing our self, the colorfull words that we @MONTH1 use can be offensive to one persson yet perfeectly fine to another. It all depends on the indivadual that likes or dislikes the word or readings. In my observations of people reading and dislikeing it because of it harsh and colorfull words is most offen people that do not fully express them selvs and our yet much more senitive. I think this also goes agenst freedom of speech. We were gaven that right so why wouldent we use it? Why wouldent people want us to express ourselvs? I have no idea why any person would want to take books,music,movies and magazines away from us. If every thing went by one mans rule of what to and not to read we would down grade as a country and @DATE1. Therefore i strongly advise not to take any books off the selves. The majordy of the people agree with me to not be censored and only the sensitive people that they offened will just make there own chiose not to pick the book off the selves,not to listen to music, And pick up the magazine. the right is ours and thats how is should stay",3,3,3,1
3212,2,"Censorship. It's a word that everyone has heard, but do people truly know what it means or how it effects them? In the past, books have been censured by rulers and leaders who thought that the material was harmful. How could they say that they knew what was best for their people? What gave them the right to decide what their people could or could not read? In today's society, we still have to deal with censorship issues. There are still people who believe that libraries need to censor their books. Censorship is wrong. Books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be removed from the shelves just because certain people find them offensive. Everyone has different tastes, not only in food, but in every other part of their lives as well. No one person has the right to say that one genre is better than another. Censorship is wrong because it limits what people can read, watch, and listen to.     Censorship should not be allowed because it limits what people can read.  Some people like mysteries, while others like to read romantic books.  If we allow people to censor what we read, then how can we say that their is a book for everyone to like? If libraries censored every book that might offend someone else, then there would not be any books left for anyone to read. For example, certain religious books might offend people of other religions, but that does not mean that we should take them off the shelves. If we did that, we would have to take away all religious books so that no one was offended. Then no one would be able to find books about their religion, and no one would benefit.     Similarly, censorship limits what people can watch. If we removed every movie that had even one tiny part that offended someone else, there would be no more movies left in the world. Every movie is going to have something that someone will love and someone will hate. If we only focus on the person who hates it and get rid of movies based on the people who hate them, then the people who love the movies will suffer for it.  People who love horror movies probably hate comedies.  This does not mean that we need to get rid of comedies just because that there are some people who dislike them. It only means that the people who don't like that type of movie don't have to watch them.     In the exact same way, censorship keeps people from enjoying the type of music that they love.  We can't censor music because everyone has different types and genres that they like. If we take away one kind of music, then we have to take away every kind of music.  It is not fair to say that we can censor one genre of music because some people dislike it or find it offensive when there are people who truly enjoy listening to that type of music. It would be unfair to those people, and if we are unfair to them, we have to be unfair to everybody. People would be even more offended than before in that case.     There will always be unhappy people in the world.  We should not result to censoring books, movies, and music in libraries and other places just to try make people happy.  Censorship in libraries limits what people can enjoy.  It makes the the people who would like the items that have been censored mad.  We should not result to that. We should allow people to pick what they like.  If a person want to read something they should be allowed.  If they want to watch a certain movie or listen to a certain song, then why not let them?  The slim margin of people who dislike what those people enjoy can just avoid reading, watching, or listening to it. We can't take something away from the people who love it just because someone is unhappy.",4,4,4,2
3213,2,"I believe that some materials are offensive to some people, but that shouldn't give them a right to want to take it off the shelves. No, I do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily over look them and not read them. Some people @MONTH1 think they are offensive but they should know that they are not directed twards them. Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for. Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine.     Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that childern won't be tempted to read them. If this is the case I think that its not the right thing to do. Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from. Weather or not you want your children to read them or not they could still find them and ask why they have never seen it before and parents wouldn't know what to say.     Libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things. If you took a book off of a shelf, that could be the book someone really needs. Don't be that person to take away from a child's learning. You never know who is going to look for what your have taken away. And if you take it away they @MONTH1 never find it.       Some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act, but you cannot blame that on reading. That's like saying that your favorite color is lime green because thats @PERSON2's favorite color. Its not true and it sure isn't right. What would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you? You would be mad at them and wonder why. It would make you anxious to read it. If they didn't hide it and you found it maybe you wouldn't want to read it because your parents would have let you see it and you wouldn't be interested.      You have your own choice when it comes to what your children read, watch, and listen to. Just don't shut them out of what you read because you were offended. Think about it, the music, movie, or book your hiding from them could be the answer to a lot of things. It could help them figure out the path they want to take, or maybe the path they don't want to take. Either way it would help them be a success in their life. So why not take the risk? It could even help you.",4,3,4,2

That is my opinion because if readers go into the library and find an offinsive book to us might not be offinsive to him/her and his/her standards. And if it is offensive to him/her so what he/she is the one checking it out so he/she obviously knos what he/she is getting in to so there for we should not remove books off the shelves if they are offinsive, because offinsive to one is not offinsive to the other. well actually my opinion goes half and half because if the movievs and librarys are inapropreate then aldults should be the only ones to buy them.      That is my personal opinion many others @MONTH1 have different opinions on this subject but i just think every thing should just stay on the shelves. And movies sold to aldults and aldults only.",3,2,3,1
3218,2,"I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed from the shelves. I say this because, what @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not come close to being offensive to another. There are many different types of books, movies and even some music that have some history to it, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to some certain race or culture it's history.          What @MONTH1 be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa. If everybody had a chance to go into the biggest library made and take something that @MONTH1 be offensive to them down I think that the library would have little to no books in it. Katherine said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' meaning if parents or teenagers took 'offensive' material off the shelf that there will be nothing else left.          A lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs, but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all. Just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. If censoring did happen in public libraries, I'm sure there will be protests and possibly riots over this censoring.            People said that @PERSON2 was a bad man, well if we take books and movies off the shelves showing what he did, I believe history will be more likely to repeat itself. A lot of things have been bad in history that we read about today, like gangs, if we don't read about the wrong they do or see the movies to show how it would be like if you were a gang member would there be an increase in gang activity and members? this is why I believc we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, etc. off of the shelves",3,3,3,1
3220,2,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our chilren or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf.'( Paterson) Katherine Paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like anyone can. That should be the right way, but I don't agree. I don't think people should be able to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive. They don't have to take the book.     I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries. If people find a book offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out. Other people might enjoy that book. Likeing a book is an opinion. For exmaple, if someone doesn't like your outfit you're probably not going to go and burn it or throw it away  because that is just that one persons opinion. That is how it goes with movies, books, music, and magazines. Everyone likes something different so their should be different books.      When you don't like a book I beleive the only time it would be right for you to take that book off the shelf would be if it was in your house. Then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book. If you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety-five percent voted to get rid of that book then I think it would be okay. You can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things, you need to think about the whole community.     I read an article about banning '@PERSON2' from schools, I didn't think that would be a good idea. '@PERSON2' was one of the top picked books by high school students. If parents didn't like their kids reading it they should have just told them not to read it. I don't think it's right for parents to just go in the school and say they didn't like that book and take it off the shelf. I t's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading '@PERSON2 @PERSON2'.     Choosing what book to read is your opinion so you don't have to read a book you dislike. People like all different books so it's not fair for them to not able to read the book they like just because other people don't like the book. What If someone didn't like a book that you loved? Would they just be able to take it off the shelf",3,4,3,1
3222,2,"Do I think materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the book shelve if they found offensive? Yes I do beause why keep it on ther if it's offensive to young kids and other people.     If it dosen't have nothing do with learning then it shouldn't be on ther. Its sertin things kids should read so if they want to put materials that are made for adults then they should put it in a sepreat section from the kids section.     They shouldn't have any music or movies that have some type of violents in it because the kids now days have to much violents as it is.The only way they should put music or movies on there is if they have learning materials in it.     So I think you should put books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelve only if they contain learning maertails and things that would persuad them to do some in they life.",3,3,3,1
3225,2,"Some of the most interesting books that I have ever read are offensive in some way. I have even read excellent books that offend me. If we didn't have books and stories that offend us, then we would never really find out what offends us. That is why I don't think books, magazines, music, or anything of that nature that @MONTH1 be found offensive in some way should be remover from the shelves.     If you think about, almost all books can be offensive or hurt your feelings. It just depends on how you feel about what has been written. Something that is offensive to one person or a group of people @MONTH1 not be found offensive by another person or group of people. If we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them, then there would be no books left.      Writing is something you do when you want to express how you feel, or tell a story about yourself or someone else. Some authors @MONTH1 do this in a very offensive manner. Others @MONTH1 try to suger-coat how they feel about a person or certain idea. Either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive.     In conclusion, i feel that books that are found offensive or hurtful should be left on the shelves because, if we took all of them off, there would not be a very wide selection of books left",4,4,4,2
3226,2,"Many places show and sell offensive material. It is found almost everywhere. Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way. So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they @MONTH1 need to be removed.       Take music for example, there @MONTH1 be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf. Music is everywhere and if someone tells you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it.     Movies @MONTH1 be different. For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material. But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was. Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it.     Books @MONTH1 be the only exception. Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive. Now with music and movies people know they aren't real its just talk or acting. But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about. which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else.       There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something. All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision.",4,4,4,2
3232,2,"Do you believe that certain materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experince, observations, and/or reading.           I do believe that if it's a book you not suppose to get, if it's not for age group, don't get it. Some libraries contains books that's highly not appropriate for children, they have sections for adults and children to check out books. Some libraries need book monitors to guide and put up certain types of books.The library is  a plcae with all types of books, so you should go to your own section and check out your type of book.           When I first went to the library for the time I didn't know what book to check out, so the librarian should me my section by showing me my age group. By then I was checking out books that was appropriate for my age, magazines I didn't care to much about, I just wanted to read a whloe book.              In conclusion, when ever you nedd a book good or check out your section, make the book is appropriate for you and feed you mind with knowledge.",3,3,3,1
3236,2,"Books, books, and more books. There are so many of these spine bound papers, filled with everything from basic @CAPS1 about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and take them to far off distant worlds. If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and iformation far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back. The problem is, that with all of this @CAPS1 and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up. There is no such thing as bad @CAPS1. There is only people who are not yet ready for the @CAPS1 they are about to obtain. So should these materials that open up doors to new minds sets, and feelings such as books, music, magazines,  and movies be censored? That answer is yes.     First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiousity that needs to be kept in children. Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners, and intellegent minds. If the @CAPS1 given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison there minds and twist them in to something they were not yet ready to become.     Secondly, @CAPS1 presented to kids to early can harm them physicaly. Children are born with the instict to repete what they observe. This is a primal instict that humans will forever have, and is essential for living life. So take movies for example. If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes, and actions, this can be very harmful to them physicaly. If a child experiences these things to soon, they will want to simply repete what they saw. Then what is next? The answer to that question is easy. There will be more teen mothers than there are needed.      Lastly, premature @CAPS1 can harm mentaly. Take music for example. Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are. This is simply a result of bad censorship. Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you can not see anything visually, but they are wrong. Music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics. There needs to be tougher ristrictions on music. Restrictions such as age for purchase should be raised, That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked.     In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. But I do not beleive that the materials that @MONTH1 be harmful or offensive should be remove as whole. Simply because adults do have the right to view these materials. Libraries around the world need to better there restrictions, even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young. We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen. After all, the children are the future of our world",4,4,4,2
3237,2,No I do not belive that certain materials should be removed. I belive that people should be able to have freedom of speech. I also belive that if somebody has something on their mind they should should be able to say it. I all ways tell peolple to mean what you say and say whay you mean. Now if its younger kids getting ahold of magazines and movies with inpropriate material in it then yes it should be censored or they shouldn't be placed in places with younger kids can get to them,2,2,2,0
3246,2,"I do in deed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries, or places where young people can see it. Things, such as pornagraphic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it. I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things.     I personaly have been in a movie rental shop, and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see. Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight, and requested if wanted.     I also have a religious view on all of this. I know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop, or library ought to respect me and my religion. @PERSON1 in the @CAPS1 says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so. We need to have the same aspect on life. If something causes someone else harm we should not do it.     This is an issue that we face every day, and the reason I am using pornagraphic material is because it is everywhere. If I am standing in the @ORGANIZATION1 check out line I see the people magazines and I find it verry offensive!     I will say though, if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want. I just find it untollerable to post these materials were viewers who do not want to see them have to see them.",3,3,3,1

3269,2,"Typically when you walk in to a library there are books, magazines, movies, and cds everywhere. Most of the items in the library are appropriate for children, but some are for adults and teenagers. Many people struggle with the fact that there are items in the library that are offensive to religion, have offensive language in them, or contain adult materials. In this country we have a freedom of speech and a freedom of religion which allows us to choose things that we feel are correct in certain situations such as this one.     True, there are books out there that are very offensive to certain types and religions of different people. Have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive? In my opinon people should have the right to censor what the library provides for their student or child, to a certain extent. If a book or magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be is offensive to someone, I believe that they should be able to choose if their student or child gets to look at that certain item. People should not take this censorship ability out of hand.     I believe that our generation is much different from ones in the past because most of the things we have to deal with are things that are most likely offensive to a certain religion and or type of person. Which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it. I believe that a person or authority figure at the moment should be able to take a book off the shelf if and only if they request it to the library and they approve of it.      People have the right to do what they choose, but taking away other peoples chances to read a book, or check out a movie is going a little far with that censorship privalige. I think that when a person feels that an item in the library is offensive they should have to sign a piece of paper stating why they think it should be taken out of the library and the people you believe it is offensive towards. In doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people.      All in all i believe that the censorship in libraries is a spectacular idea because of all the bad things in the world that come out in books, movies, and cds. People have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong. They should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better! Do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea? I do, because it gives people to oportunity to change and make things better for themselves if they believe something is offensive.",4,4,4,2
3271,2,"Censorship of books     Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes because certain things need to be removed from the shelves for example many things that don't need to be seen out in public. Personaly I think censoring certain things is alright because there are certain books that shouldn't be seen, music that has either swearing talking about drugs or other things, movies that kids shouldn't see like the rated '@CAPS1' or '@NUM1' that has either blood or nudity or somethen on that line, and magazines now magazines there are many types of magazines like for example adult, children, cooking, cleaning, house things, stuff for dogs or cats, and outside stuff.      But censoring things that could be 'offensive' I can't understand how books can be offensive because some books are talking about history or something that has happen to them. Like for example lets just say a colored kid comes in and reads a book on '@CAPS2 slavery' that kid right there is going to get offensive about it and then that kid is going to say 'You owe me something because my anscetores were slaves' no your very wrong there kid because you either read the book wrong or you just didn't understand it. I have done that a couple of times either I got offensive about it and started getting very angry about it or just tose it in the trash because I got mad because I got offensive about it. Don't get me wrong I love reading but like I said before certain things are just ment to never be read or just never be found.     But as for me getting offensive about a couple of books, movies, music, or magazines @CAPS13 I don't read magazines so I can't get offensive about that but books, movies, and music I take very offesively because like if I read lets just say the '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' and then I watch the movies @CAPS13 I take it offensively because nothing didn't tie in with the books or that person didn't direct it right.      For books like I said I love reading books don't get me wrong but I do take very offensively because like something the character did or something that I wished I shouldn't have done something like that or a character dies and it reminds me of a close friend of mine or a teacher something on that line I either cry or I just stop reading the book period.     Music now I could go all day on that because for example I used to love rap with a passion but now rap is just becoming horrible because the rapper is either talking about killing someone, drugs, or 'sex' it's like I said 'horrible' thats one thing that needs to go away for a long long time. But there are many other types besides rap. There is @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7 @CAPS8, punk, @CAPS1&@CAPS10, etc like I said I could go all day on music.     The people who are censoring things like t.v. shows like for example @CAPS11 @CAPS12 seriously there is nothing wrong with that show some people are censoring that because adults think it is bad @CAPS13 people there is nothing bad with that show. I have been watching it since I was five years old and there was nothing bad on it then, then why would there be something bad on it now. All there is, is a grown man acting like a child it's like your going to tell your husband or your wife or your kids '@CAPS13 @CAPS14 I'm sorry but I have to censore you because your a bad person.'      I'm not saying that I would censore it I'm just saying maybe we as people should just take the time to look through some of these shows before censoring them.                                                              @PERSON1",4,4,4,2
3273,2,"I for one like books, movies, music, ect., without censoring. Sheltering the younge is not too bright because they'll get curious of things and sometimes they dont tell us they just find out for themselves. Most media and books have things uncensored for many different reasons and I think its going good. Yes there are some youth that take somethings too seriously but thats because the parents are not there to explain. I'm not saying go and show a four year old a rated '@CAPS1' movie but lighten up on somethings.      Music is everywhere it's kind of hard to shelter your kid from music anyways because it's, well everywhere. You should be there to watch what there listening to but they're going to hear it sooner or later, might as well let them hear it around you then some one else that will give them the wrong advice. Some parents complain so much about this subject because they don't want to have to be there all the time to explain everything, but then why have a kid if you can't take that responsibility.      Books are not so different, if a book has certain things that parents dont want their children reading then take it away from them. But most books with that kind of stuff don't have any pictures so they would have to imagine it and if they don't know what is being talked about then they wont be able to think of anything bad anyways. I'm not going to be a careless parent but I don't think sheltering kids from the real world and media and books is a good idea, very unwise.      Kids are going to learn about curse words, drinking, and stuff like drugs someday, it's up to the parents to be there and teach the kid from right and wrong if they have a question from something they heard or watched or read. People worry too much about censoring and making sure everything is clean but media and books are not all clean, never has been 'till some people got lazy and didn't want to be there for their child @PERCENT1.      When I was young my parents didn't shelter me or keep me from reading what I wanted to read, and I turned out fine. I don't drink or do drugs, because my parents were there if I had a question about something I didn't understand in a book or media. It's not the media or literature it's the parents, and if they can't be there to explain then why did they become parents.      And as for magazines, if a parent is really that worried about certain ones around their children then don't let them buy them it's your choice.      Don't you want your kid to get out there and live their own life when they become an adult? Then don't shelter them from everything. Let them find out about stuff when they ask a question. If they read something in a book and don't understand it then either you could tell them whether it's right or wrong or let them find out the bad way, that's your choice. If they see something on @CAPS2 then explain don't just freak out and block them from knowing what's out there in the real world.      It's your choice to make on all that, but if you shelter them too long they'll never have a good life. Sheltering @MONTH1 not seem so bad now but wait 'till they get older and start they're lives, they wont know what to do or how to talk to people right. I've seen it with my own eyes on how bad sheltering kids from media and books can take effect on certain things in a human being's life.     Censoring everything isn't good, the only way to learn anymore these days about real life is media and books. Not cesoring all that will help people see what the world needs to work on. So don't censor everything and let the next generation know what the generation before did wrong.",4,4,4,2
3274,2,"In our world today, there is a way to find anything that you could ever want under one roof.  People call these buildings libraries.  Libraries hold almost every book ever writen and offer them to the public free of charge.  If you can not find what you are looking for in a book, they also have many other resources: movies, music, magazines, and the internet.  I am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody.     There is always somebody out in the world that would say they are offened just to make a point or to get attention in our world today even if they did not even care about the subject at hand.  The internet can take you to just about any thing that you would ever want to go to.  Yes, the libraries do have blocks on the internet for websites that are very outragously offensive, but people have learned how to get around the blocks.     Libraries are set up to where all the kids materials is in one location, all the teenage stuff is in another spot, and all the adult materials are in another room.  As a young child, I liked going to  libraries and having fun and reading, but the one thing I never did was go to the adult room and I think many other other kids feel the same way.  In fact, I have never seen a child in the adult section of a library.     Movies and music have ratings and if the rating is over what the child should be watching, then the child can not check the movie or music without a parent's signiture.  This ensures that kids can not check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent.     Our libraries are set up just fine the way they are and I feel we should not try to change the libraries in any way.  Movies and music have rating and kids can not check out offensive materials.  The materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest.  Last but not least, if we took out everything in libraries that are offensive, then we would know longer have libraries in our communities.",4,4,4,2
3276,2,"That saying Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I disagree with that statement. I think it is the goverment's choice if these items should be taken out of libraries or not. So we will need ligitement reason's to take some books off the shelf.     Some people think we should take books off the shelf that teach the kid's our history. People don't have that right to take away from children. In the statement Katherine made, she is supporting that very idea; taking away our kids right to learn US history. The kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away. Then what will our future generation be like. Some kid's might not even know who @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is or how we got here to this very continent.     Parents also don't want us to read anything in books that have foul language or anything to do with nudity. I see what theese parents are trying to do. They are trying to protect their children, but the fact is people are going to have to go through this in life and if they arn't introduced at a younger age what will they do when they are older. Some kids that have that right taken away from will have no idea what to do when they get older and the foul language in the texts of theese books put voice into the books. We don't want the up coming generations to be blind to all of this because it is the real world.     When I was was in fifth grade I liked to read alot. I really liked the adventure books such a the boxcar children and books like that. One time I went into the library and I picked out a book about a haunted house. The librarian would not let me check the book out because there were some texts in the book not apropriate for me. That sort of crushed my reading spirit and I really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself any more. So adults that want to take theese books of the shelves you might be stopping our generation from learning and if we don't learn then our next generation isn't going to want to read anything or learn.     Theese are just a couple of reason we should not take books, magazines, movies, and music away from us. There are more people out there that have reasons to, so if you want to take this right away from us then be prepared for an argument because will fight for this right. So you adults who want to take that book off the shelf, you better have real good ligitement reason to take it off.",3,4,3,1
3282,2,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3:     @CAPS4 I am @PERSON1 and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries.  And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation.  There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate.  Many people have differnt opinions then other people. Everyone had a differnt point of view and sees things differently.  Ecspecially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids.     I believe if a child comes home with a book, movies, etc. and their parent does not approve the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate.  The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it.  And if she finds it not approprite then she has the right to take it off the shelf.     If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not apropriate and the librarian believes it is alright then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library.  Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says its inappropriate the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section, and maybe put it in a older kid area.       I have actaully had an experience with this.  At my old school adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate.  When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books.  The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library.  So she had a great idea.  She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk.  If you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book.  It was a really good idea, because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldnt even see them.  And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all.     Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people books, movies, etc. go talk to them about why they are over there and, tell them that, that's not their age level material.  Try to direct them over to their age level area, and try to find them a book, movie, etc they @MONTH1 be interested in.     I believe that everyone has different opinions but just because one person complains it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone.  Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too.  I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme.  There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoyes the stuff there.  There should be action,adventure, humor, love, etc.  Talk to people and see what they like.  And just because one person complains, dont take it out right away because to another person they might love it.  Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped",4,4,4,2
3283,2,"i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc.",3,3,3,1
3288,2,"There are thousands of libraries throughout the world. All of which are filled with numberous books, magazines, music, movies, ect. for people of all ages to obtain. Some people think that materials in a library should be censored while others think everything should be allowed to be there. I do not think materials at a library should be removed, or censored, because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research.     Materials at libraries should not be censored because the materials allowed at the libraries would decrease. Everyone has different opinions on what they think is appropiate or not. If one person were to decide a book was unappropiate and take it off the shelf, another person would have the right to take another book that they thought was unappropiate off the shelf as well. However, since everyone has different beliefs on what is appropiate and what is not, the books would rapidly decrease.The same would apply to the other items at the libraries such as magazines, movies, ect.     Another reason is because everyone has their own choice about what they want to look at in a library. A fifty year old man would not have the same intrests as a thirteen year old girl, so if some materials were removed, there would not be as much of a variety to chose from. If there is a little variety to chose from due to materials being censored, the amount of people using the library would decrease causing the library to eventually get shut down from the lack of people using it.      Lastly, materials at a library should not be censored because each and every item there could help with some kind of research. A child from high school could go to the library to look for a book to help research things for a report in one of their classes, or an elder women could go to the library in search of a cookbook to research something new to make for her next home cooked meal. Both people would need a material from the library to help them with their reasearch, but if some materials at the library were removed, they might not be able to find something to help them.     Materials at a library should not be censored because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research. Some people believe removing items at a library should be allowed, but I strongly disagree. There are many different materials in the libraries around the world today for people of all ages to come in contact with, and that is the way it should stay",4,4,4,2
3289,2,"In my opinion i don't really think certain items should be romoved from the library. I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing. In my personal opinion I never remove anything from a library because I know their are alot of people with many interests. At the same time I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library, beacuse they could not appropriate for childrern. If we removed cerain items from the library people would get mad.      I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things. There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area, and others are in another area. We can aslo make sure that no under age kid can go to an adult area. If we don't remove nothing from the library we would have alot of people coming. In the other hand if we removed a certain type of books, people would get mad and not come to the library. If that happens smaller amounts of people will come.      In my personal opinion no item should be removed from the library because many people  have many interesting in many topics in the library. If we remove a certain item from the library then we would loose a certain amount of people. Thats why we should not remove anything from the library to provent the decrease of people coming to the library. Like I said many people have many intersts in many things and they deservie to enjoy them in the library.",3,2,3,1
3290,2,"Books mean a lot to people that love to read. Books have pictures, or they @MONTH1 even be poem books. Some books should not be on the shelves in libraries. They have offesive language and not so well of pictures. They @MONTH1 be learning books but the little kids do not need to see that. I think books should be removed from the shevles if found offensive.      Libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not. The books, movies, music, ect. needs to be in a certain section of the library to where the little kids can not go or reach. A library is a family place not a fun zone for adults.     On @DATE1, I went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him. @CAPS2 is only six about to be seven. He had told me he wanted to get a book about dinosuars, but I told him to get one on space and aliens. @CAPS2 was very into reading. He  read to our mom everynight before he would go to bed. We were walking down @CAPS1 street when a bolt of lighting struck through the trees. 'ekkkk!' said @CAPS2 as he ran around me. We walk into the library and the old lady at the front desk says, 'there is a huge storm coming.' We sorta ignore her and go on about our bussiness picking our books for @CAPS2. @CAPS2 and I walk up stairs to the childrens section. @CAPS2 is looking around and he says 'hey kayla, what is this and he picks up a naughty magaizine. i rush over to snach it out of his hands and he gets scared. He ask 'but sissy what is that?' I do not respond. I tell him to pick a book and come on. He grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off. It was completely dark. '@CAPS3 stay calm.' a man says. The back up lights come on and we all go to the lobby area. We sit there for twenty mins and the lights are back on. Everything is normal again and we go to check out. We get up to the front and i turn in the bad magazine that @CAPS2 had found. The lady askd why I was bringing it to her and i had to tell her the bad news, that it was up in the childrens section. She said 'oh my!' @CAPS2 laid his books up on the counter and we checked out. We walked out the front doors and we were on our way home.",4,3,4,2
3291,2,"Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in.     Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history. With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'.  If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books.     The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not.      The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers.     In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them.",5,5,5,3
3293,2,"Recently the growing issue of censorship in libraries came to my attention. This is unfortunent in the extreme. People have a right to unmolested knowledge and censoring libraries is a direct violation of that right. Libraries are meant to be a place of learning and they should be kept that way.     History is filled with moments both glorious and inglorious. We aren't always proud of want we do or what happens but those events remain, irrespective of whether or not we choose to acknowledge it. To think turning a blind eye to the less than clean will make it go away is not only unrealistic but also totally ignorent of facts.     I realise that there are some things chilldren should not see or hear and I'm not suggesting we expose them to these things. I'm merely saying that trying to hide them from what we deem to be unclean is neither right nor a good idea in general. We can't shelter our children forever and sooner or latter they will learn things we wish they didn't. This is inevitable. Life doesn't seek to hide its darker side from us at all and to hide it from our children will serve little more than to handicap them. Do children need to be protected for some things? Yes, for a time, they do but it is the role of the induvidual parent to protect their child. Protect the children but don't do so at the expence of everyone else.     Why should the views of some hinder all others? Those who would persume to know what people should see and what they should not are out of touch. Those prudish enough to believe that people need to be protected for natural, form history, or from their own desires have no more right, and preahaps even less than everyone else to interfere with induvidual decision making. People have a right to make their own choices on what them believe but no right to force those oppinions on others.       This essay @MONTH1 make no difference but it has said what needed to be said and thus served it's purpose. With that task completed I can finnish with a good concious.",4,5,4,2
3294,2,"I believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons. I feel everyone should know the history of the world, whch means rascitism or being offended. I feel if you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you , just turn it off.  You aren't being force to listen or read it, its your choice.      Libraries should keep the materials cause the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended. I certainly don't like the feeling of being offended, but its something people go through life with. There @MONTH1 be people out there that probably disargree's with me, its just my oponion. You @MONTH1 go to the certain libraries in the world that doesn't allow certain people in because of their oponions on the selection of materials the library offers.     I once heard a woman at a library talking about how she went to the police about someone writing offensive things towards her religion on the internet @CAPS1 happen to the person but, its the fact that she went to the police. She could have handle the sitiutation herself, by just comforting the person about it. I feel that the mintue she started to read it, she should have turned away or got off the website. It was her decision to keep reading it. I don't see why she should go to the police, if it was just the person's oponion.      Libraries should keep the materials cause maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offend. Libraries shouldn't have to hide this topic from anybody. People are offensive because they were rasied or just born that way. Some people just have to deal with these people. They might not like it or @MONTH1 do somethings towards them in there lifetime but, they have to live with them.     In the end, either if they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people. Libraries shouldn't just change there ways for certain people that don't like the materials. They are plenty people of the world that want to learn more on the topic. These people shouldn't be stopped by the ones who don't like the topic. Its just apart of life",4,4,4,2
3298,2,"Many people base their actions on their own views. What @MONTH1 appear to be justified in their minds, due to their beliefs, might cause an uproar from others. One instance of this: media censorship. It happens every day, every place. Someone can take it upon them selves to ,in their mind, 'make the piece better for @CAPS8 viewing'. In reality, though, they are really ruining the experience of the media for everyone else and even impeading on the rights granted to us by the constitiution: @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2.                First up, books in the library. Everytime I go to the library and pick up some books, there is always one book with the 'bad parts' marked out. Someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them. To me, it was irritating. I don't always like those words either, but having them marked out is distracting from the page and , for me, ruins the author's voice and style of writing, hence impairing what I draw from the book. Some marked-out words aren't always offensive to others, either. Simply put, if you find the book offensive, don't read it. Others @MONTH1 enjoy it, whether they share your views or @CAPS7.           People also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive. If everyone removed anything they didn't like, or found offensive, there would be nothing left in the world for anyone to enjoy. We, as @LOCATION1 citizens, have the right to make our own choices, and our choices should @CAPS7 be limited by the views of certain individuals. That means that if I want to read or view something, it should be available to me, so I @MONTH1 learn and expand my views, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable.           With nearly every disputable form of media that comes out, people harangue the producers and say the piece should have never been made. Wrong. Producers and authors can publish whatever they would like. It's called @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2, and it is a right garunteed to us, as @CAPS5 citizens, under the @CAPS6. And learly, if pieces like that are being produced, people read it. Plain and simple. You might @CAPS7, but maybe a neighbor, or even a relative, @MONTH1 @CAPS7 be offended by it and might read it. Supply and demand. If everyone found it offensive, no one would buy or read it, and because of that, it would no longer be produced. You would get your way. But, no. Some people do read it and it is produced. Again, if you don't like it, don't read it.          People should @CAPS7 take it upon themselves to censor what others can and can't do, see, or read. If someone wants to read a story that has 'bad words' in it, so be it. Others should @CAPS7 ruin the experience by marking the words out. @CAPS7 only is it rude and ruining the experience for the reader, but it is also destroying someone else's property. If someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion, so be it. They have the right and no one can take that right away from them. In my opinion, censorship in libraries, whether by government, or other civilians, should @CAPS7 be allowed. We citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in @CAPS8 libraries, the @CAPS8 should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want. Choice is one of the prinicples of the constitution, and it should be protected, @CAPS7 limited",4,4,4,2
3299,2,"Many libraries contain books, movies, music, and magazines that can be considered offensive.  All of these libraries, however, have certain reasons to have these books.  Whether those reasons are for education or for recreation, the libraries have reasons for them.  So, the libraries that do have 'offensive' books, should be allowed to keep them because they are not offensive to everyone, and they could be beneficial to the reader.     These books that are considered offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be offensive to others.  For example, @PERSON2, who is from the @CAPS1, comes into a library and finds a book that is all about the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and she reads that the @CAPS1 is full of a bunch of people who mistreated their slaves.  @PERSON2 gets a @CAPS5 offended by this. Then @CAPS5 @PERSON3, who is an @CAPS6 @CAPS7, picks up the same book and reads all about the @CAPS1 and how they treated their slaves.  @CAPS5 @PERSON3 thinks that the same book that @PERSON2 hated is a great book.  As shown in the example, @LOCATION2's people are very diverse, but what comes with that diversity is a lot of opposing views in its citizens.  A library doesn't want to only appeal to one race, it wants to appeal to all of them, the only way to have that happen is to accidently offend some people in the process.  The citizens of the @LOCATION1 need to be more understanding that their race isn't the only one here.  If a book offends a person, that person simply should not read it.  However, these books, who many @MONTH1 find offensive, could also be beneficial to its readers.     Some of these books could be helpful to the people who choose to read it.  Going back to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 reference, @PERSON2 was reading her @LOCATION3 @CAPS11 text book, and she read about the horrible deeds the @CAPS1 had done regarding their slaves and the fact that they lost the @CAPS3 to the @ORGANIZATION1, and she got offended because her side lost.  Then @CAPS5 @PERSON4, who is in the same class as @PERSON2, was reading his history text book and was becoming more and more elated as he read on.  He found out that kids all over the the country were learning about what had happened to his ancestors and that the @ORGANIZATION1 defeated the @CAPS1.  @PERSON3 was as happy as he could be with this book, whereas @PERSON2 couldn't be any more displeased.  If this book was pitched out of the library, how would students all over the nation learn of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3? They wouldn't.     Libraries cannot just throw out books because they offend someone.  As Katherine Paterson said, if we all picked a pile of books that offend us and got rid of them, then there wouldn't be any books left for any of us to read because other nations would be offended by the books that appealed to one, and so on and so forth.  So, libraries need to keep the books that they have and get even more books.  This nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to.  We just need to remember that not all of the books appeal to us and not to get offended by those that don't.",4,4,4,2
3301,2,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,      @CAPS3, my name is @PERSON1 and I think that everyone has a right to there own opinion. People @MONTH1 not want there kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them were there kids cant find them. Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot. There is a lot more bad things in life than a movies, books, and music that childreen listen to, watch, or read.     I think that the world is more harmfull sometime than anything. Adults @MONTH1 want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on tv. But, if there kids wanna learn about things that happen thats not the greatest, then people should let them.     It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people dont like it. Why should other people have to change just for the ones who dont like it. There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchesed at the age of eight-teen. Thats why people should be ok with things that dont envolve minors. Having things censored ruins a lot of things, the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way.     I'm sure many people @MONTH1 not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about. People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored. That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things. So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored. Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way.     Sincerely,      @PERSON1",3,3,3,1
3302,2,"I believe as a citizen of this city and as a avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is neccessary. Some of the material in the libraries @DATE1 are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive. Do we really want our children looking at half-nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color?     In @DATE1's libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism. Take for instance the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1.' In the movie the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the @CAPS3-@CAPS4 children. This is a wonderful example of why censorship is neccessary. Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is @CAPS3-@CAPS4, it would be very offensive to them. Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in @CAPS1 opinion.     In @DATE1's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books. You @MONTH1 think that it is okay to let  your child watch a movie rated @NUM1, but little did you know, there is nudity in it. Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet.      Also, in books this is becoming an issue. It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it. Once I found this out, I asked @CAPS1 mother to please take it back. These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries.     Language usage in music is also a big deal. Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music. This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves. You @MONTH1 think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary.     I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration. It @MONTH1 be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite @NUM1 movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves. Especially when you get older and have children. You will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child",4,4,4,2
3307,2,Durning school one day all of our teachers told the class that most of the books in the libary is going to be took off the shelves. But our class don't want that to happen. All the teachers told us that some people parents has been complaning about what there kids are reading. I thank that most the the books that are in the libary is good for the kids to look at because thats what they like annd they like to learn about what would like to have or do someday. I also thank that it is a good thing that kids are wanting to learn about what they want to do later in life. Later in life when I have kids I would like them to dream about what they want to do in there life. So if that means that they want to go to school and look at magazines all day and make sure that thats what he wants to do thats fine with me.     So if the teachers want the books off the shelves they can but I don't think that the kids are going to try much if they cant be what they want to be later in there life time. I know that if they did that to my kids that I know I would buy them all the magazines thay want so they can learn what they want to do in life. So if they take all the books off the shelves I know that all the kids parents are probley going to get mad because thats what messes up the kids dreams.     Know when the kids what to read the schools is taking all the good books off the shelves none of the kids are going to know what they want to do in there later life. A good thing to do is to let the studends vote and see what the what to do about taking the books off the shelves. I bet most of the students in this world would say to keep them on the shelves because they like to read and look at pictures. That means that they want to be something when they grow up. I hope that my kid whats to be something that he likes to do when he grows up. I will help any kid as much as I can with there dreams.     There is two things that are going to happen. One is that the school is going to take the books off the shelves and the students are not doing to try in school and they might not know what they want to be. Or they might just give up on it all. And I know that know one whats that to happen. The second thing is that the schools is going to keep the books on the shelves and the students are going to want to read them more. Also they will probley know want whey want to do later in there life time. If I could pick what to do I would keep the books on the shelves and make the kid happy,3,3,3,1
3313,2,"I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries. There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others.     There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library. Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuedo? What can you do about this problem? You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem.     The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read.     So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone",3,3,3,1
3317,2,"Have you ever got or check out a book or something that has been racial to you or you think it should have been censored? I haven't but I checked out a book before that had a lot of racism in it and sex. Im not racist but some people are very racist. Some of the book in libraries aren't sutible for some viewers but yet again the can check it out, some books, movies, magazings, and others should be taking in consideration on being removed so some viewers can't read them.     In libraries there are book that have alot of racism in them. Some racism gets to be very bad in the book and it could intrest and provoke the young viewer to go down that road in a later life. Which could be very bad if you think about it. He could talk his friends into becoming what he is. talk them into becoming racist towards others. No mother or father wants their kids to be racist, but there are familys that are racist. Which i don't get because we are all the same to me.      In some books in the library there is sex talk that accores in it. Sometimes the sex talk gets into great detail which isn't sutible for young viewers, because they could get the idea that they want to try that with someone of a different genger. Which is okay if ur older but if ur really young and reading a book with sex talk in it. Well that's wrong because young kids shouldn't be introduced to that kind of life stile till later in life. Some parents wouldn't like their kids to read that kind of book. I know I won't let me kid read a book like that.      Music is something that everyone listens to, no matter is its rap, country, or the blues. Certain people like certain kind of music. Some people think that rap music is offensive and should be removed off the shelves. Well rap music is based on their past and how their life is. It does have some racism in it like certian rappers say bad words that aren't really sutible for young viewers.      Although some of the racism and cencorship that should be cencored are on shelves, I think it should be in a separete room so only older people can check it out or buy it, instead of the young kids getting a hold of it. I believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past",3,3,3,1
3318,2,"New @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3     Have you ever seen a movie or read a book that you did not want your kids/family to read? I know I have, and sometimes there is no stopping them from seeing or reading those books/movies. I don't necessarily think the offensive books should be removed, but I think they should be relocated to a different part of the @CAPS3. This @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 should only be entered by an adult, or with an adults permission.     Little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff. What the kids don't realize is that most of it is fake, and the things that happen in movies aren't really true. By having this seperated @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3, it gives parents the chance to get the racist, drug/gang filled, and murder books away from the children. This will be good for every race too! If an african american family does not want there child to be reading books about slavery or gangs, they can keep them out of the @CAPS1 of books where slavery and gangs are. Some books are really emotional and can trigger a persons emotions. If someone is going through a really hard time and they read a book about suicide, they are more likely to think about killing themself.      I think by separating the bad influencing books from the good influencing books it well help alot. People under the age of @NUM1 are not permitted to be in this @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 without a parent, or parent signature. So come on down to the @CAPS2 council on @DATE1 and vote for the new @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3! Thank you for your time.",3,3,3,1
3321,2,"Censorship, thats a word that causes alot of arguements in today's society. People have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world. In some countries dictators do @CAPS4 allow their citizens to have internet access watch the news or in some more extreme cases @CAPS4 even watch television at all. The majority of the time they do this because they do @CAPS4 want the citiznes of their country to know what is happening around the world. This sets up a 'fish bowl' environment meaning that people from other countries see all of the issues in that country but the people actually in the country have no idea whats going on around them.     Although we don't always see censorship in that extreme of a sense it is still plays a large part in today's society. Everything from music on the radio to military files are censored. Think about it, how often can you listen to a song on the radio that all of the original words are still intact? Arguements over censorships have gone back and forth for years without really making much prgress at all. Each side of the arguement whether its for or against censorship is almost entirely opinionative. No one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or @CAPS4. It's just to hard to determine who's opinion is really, more convincing.     In my opinion I dont think anything should be consored, if the writer of a @CAPS1 show throws in a vulger word most likely it's for the effect that it has on people to show emotion. The samething goes for songs, when an artist writes the lyrics to a song they are trying to convey a message and they use certain words that get their point across more effectively or more dramatically. Parents argue that their children are seeing to much violence on @CAPS1 and are causing behavior problems along with other things, and that shows need to be more suiting for children. There is an alternative to censoring all of these things, rather than 'ruining' everyone's fun just dont let your kids watch that show.      In the @LOCATION1 today we have something called freedom, we exercise this right everyday with what we wear, and what we say. I think that we should take that freedom and apply it to censorship. Instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on @CAPS1 you can make a decision simply to @CAPS4 watch that kind of show. Everyone has the option to say NO; if you dont want to hear or see something simply choose something else to watch, or even just do someting entirely different. You DO @CAPS4 have to do anything that you don't want to do. It's is an easy solution, all you have to do is exercise a right that you have had since the day you were born an just say no, I dont want to do that. It's very simple and could potentially stop all debates on whether or @CAPS4 things need to be consored.",4,4,4,2
3326,2,"I believe that indeed certian books sould not be on libraries shelves. And some people @MONTH1 feel the need to remove books of their choosing but, I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their problem. I believe that if you do not like the books then stay away from them. Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then, yes by all means remove them. I personally know parents that would not allow their childern to need a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed. I find it rediculous, but that is the way they parent their kids. And as long as they dont take it upon themselves to force they parenting methods on to libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it.      I find that some people see books on slavery and the holocost and such topics to be offensive. I see those books as our history, those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up. What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult? People seem to be trying to shield the world from thing like swear words. Why? If a book has a few curse words oh well, tell your kids to stay away from it if you think its bad. But, do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library. People have different views, we always have and we always will. If a parent feels so strongly about a few books get a postition and get signatures saying that these books should be removed or atleast moved to a different part of the library. Do not force your thoughts on some one else",3,3,3,1
3333,2,"Censorship in Libraries      I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Just because some people think it's offensive doesnt't mean all people think it's offensive. Some people @MONTH1 like the content it shows.        I think that things in a library shouldn't be removed because everyone has their own point of view. If something was removed every time someone would walk in, then there would be no library. A library is supposed to be a variety of books. It is not supposed to be just one genre that only one person likes.        It is important to offer alot of variety because if a library doesn't have alot of variety, then the library would lose all kinds of customers. A library doesn't want to target just kids or teen through aduts. The library wants to target all aspects of people. Even if it means that some content is innapropriate. All books are innapropiate if you look at them in the wrong way.       I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Everyone has their own point of view. A library should have a variety of books. Not just one genre a person wants.",3,3,3,1
3336,2,Their are some books that should not be removed from libraries do to censorship. From past exsperian with censorship I found out it can towne down a book. In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1 for exsample the books are being burnt and it is causing socity to fall apart. Censorship is from people with a more ethnich back ground that dont want the kids to grow up and see unappopreat langue.      The most recent book that I have heard of geting censored is @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The main word they are removing from this book is nigar because some people fined this word very ofinceve to their race. The comittys are trying to remove the books from school shelfs.     I think we should not have censorship just because parents do not want their kids to hear the words in school or read them when eventualy the kids will learn the words on their own or hear the words some were eles. The kids can even learn the word from their own parrent or from t.v. I personaly think that comittys should stop trying to censor every thing because they wont be able to sencer how adults talk when they are around chindren and younger adults,3,2,3,1
3338,2,"First off, I do like censorship laws to an extent.  However, the government cannot ban everything that they deem innapropriate.  I think it depends more on what the family deems innapropiate.     I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages.  I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content.  I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests, then they should just not look at it.  They are not required to look at it so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it.     However, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magaines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else.  And if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them.  But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about innapropriate material.  As I said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it.     I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials.  One parent should not have the ability to take away others' privilages to books, because they deem it innapropriate.  Just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it.     Also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials.  However, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then I think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings.",3,3,3,1
3345,2,"All of us have rights, all of us have the same chance to express what we feel, think or believe. Freedom is the most beautiful and important thing we have and nobody can take that away from us: its just something that belongs to ourselves and that everybody does have.     As humans it is not easy to understand othe people's thoughts and it could turn kinda of hard to accept the opinions that extrangers from us can apport.     A library is a place where we can find all kind of material that can easily answer many or our questions, sometimes some material can be offensive and make a target of people feel unconfortable as well as there is material that can be really helpful through our searching.     If i had the right to remove any magazine, book or movie off the shelf, i would at least think about it before remove it and consider how helpful and worth it it could be for someone that really needs it, and if everybody else had the same right as me, the we wouldn't have any material at all in the library.     Music is a big topic to talk about, we all know there are people that are really used to listen to a type of music that other people can call it as 'rude music' and i could be pretty much offensive for kids. I trully believe it wont be fear for any of us to labeled people because of the music they like, the books they read or the movies they watch.

3346,2,"Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not.     I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive.     In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different point of view. The author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive.",2,2,2,0
3349,2,"There are tons of books in the library that people @MONTH1 find offensive to young readers today. I think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves. People have a right to read what they choose to read. There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library.     First of all, there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive.' @CAPS1 removing all of these offending books, you would basically be removing half the books in the library. Most young adult books have something to do with teens, drugs, violence, and other things that would come off as offensive. These books are usually the ones that teenagers read. Just because they're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected. These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody.     Secondly, I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch. Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this purpose. Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike.      Finally, I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake. There are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known. Children wouldn't know about them, and they could be missing out on some great stories.     Everyone has an opinion, and watching out for your children is understandable. Censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people. Libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste.",3,4,3,1
3350,2,I don't think that they should be removed from the shelfs. Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time. To were no little kids can rent the book. If they are complaining about how it's volgar or sexual. Then you shouldn't take it away. Try something else such as an adult section. One person @MONTH1 love a book that has some violence in it and on the other hand you @MONTH1 have a person who is real religous and can't stand to see it.      There are very many view points of this topic. The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of life style. Some people don't really think about it being as bad as the next person. If it's a book you dislike on a book shelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight. Should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down?     Some people don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final thought on what gets taken down it @MONTH1 affect the kids reading habbits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf any more. Then they don't want to read the books that are left up on the shelf. I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike.     My point of view on this topic is simple. I don't think the parents should be in controle of what we read as long as it's appropriate. I think the decision should be left for the government to say which book should and shouldn't be taken away.,3,4,3,1
3355,2,"I don't believe any of those materials are offensive if found in a library. But if the childrens look somewhere else to find those things then they will find them anytime. The offensive materials are out there to be pick up by some people including children.     The books aren't offensive only if found in the adult area. If so found there the children would'nt read it because it's too long for them and the book doesn't have any pictures in the book. Music is offensive but like I said only found in the adult area. Kids aren' interesting in music at that ageso they would'nt bother to see them. Movies and Magazines have offensive things in it and can be found any where, but found in a library is gonna be rare. The only thing you will find in a library that is offensive is gonna be a magazine.they make a bunch of different type of them, and can be found anywhere.     To explain the offensive, and the none offensive books that are out there. I'm gonna talk about '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 book has a lot of bad words, sexual scenes, drugs, gang violence, racism. @CAPS3 book is so offensive that the childrens parents would'nt let them read it, but @CAPS3 book is based on a true story. Everything that happened in that book was real, and people need to know what happened and why were the people in that story doing those things. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive but you can learn from others mistake by reading that book.     Everything @MONTH1 be offensive to you in one way, but looking from the other point of view it's a learning experience. People that made those mistake could tell the childrens that those stuff aren't wroth it. Everything has it's purpose. The books can tell you the story of peoples life, and the movies are based from the story and instead you can watch it. Music can tell you the life of people by poetry. Magazines really dont have a point their just there to gossip",3,3,3,1
3357,2,"Books, movies, music, and even @CAPS1 are all important in this life, and enviorment of ours. They all have a learning process. When you read you learn, when you watch a movie you learn, even when you listen to music you can learn. Weather its about past present or future, everyone has the right to learn it's part of being a citizen.     Speaking of all this I belive just beacuse one book, or one movie makes someone uncomfortable i dont think that you should take that away. Thats not only taking away from your kid, or yourself thats taking away from everyone else. Just like the book huckleberry fin it's a wonderful book i love it because it's about the old days where they still belived in slavery, and there were still some good-hearted people around.     This book to some would be very offensive beacuse of the fact it has the word nigger in it one-hundered and twenty-seven times. In fact last year at my school a mother tried to get it taken out, because she didnt want her son to read it he was actually a mixed boy but thankfully the committee saved it and it's still here. That's our history and everyone needs to learn some of it, weather it's offensive or not.     As well as movies that can and mostly likely is offensive to people, they still should not have that stuff taken off either, like I said earlier thats taking away from everyone else. If you dont wanna see it then dont buy it, or if something that you find innapropriate comes on just change the channel. History is important and I dont think people should keep you from your right as a citizen and deprive you from learning what you wanna learn or need to learn for the future.      Now the music part i can understand, some @MONTH1 be a little innapropiate for younger listeners so like i said before again change the station or dont buy that @CAPS2. Dont deprive people of what they wanna learn, watch or listen to.     People that feel offended or embrassed should be ashamed of them self because that is very selfish, and rude. No one should be ashamed of who they are or any movie that describes the old days in the way it actually happened, if they put it in the nice way then it would all just be a lie. That's why I dont belive in censorship. It should not happen, any book, movie, magazine, @CAPS2 should be available to who wants it",3,3,3,1
3362,2,"Dear @CAPS1:     Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library? Would you want your children influenced by these findings? These are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries.      As a concerned citizen I am writing to you to relect my opinion on censorship in libraries. In my own personal experiences I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people that still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a seperate room for the offensive materials. If there was a seperate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids. When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place. In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1, or a old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet. The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library.       Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside. For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true. If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they @MONTH1 not be comfortable having their child there. Libraries need to be kid friendly places, so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer.       As you can see, offensive materials should not be in libraries. All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials that is not possible. Please consider the following.      Kind regards,         @PERSON2",4,4,4,2
3364,2,"Censorship is important. Especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we take them off the shelves?     I personally think no, most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but alot of it has to do with people's opinions. The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. The authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people.     This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. Rated @CAPS1 movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games. Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch. Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world",4,4,4,2
3368,2,"Isn't  it shocking that some books, music, movies and magazines you find on your library shelf today aren't appropriate for the little ones. I believe that if you have to question whether a child should be listening or viewing this item then it shouldn't be in or around a child section at all. Some content could be offensive to not just children but also to teenagers and adults.      Some music @MONTH1 contain words that are children shouldn't be exposed to. Music such as hip/hop and rap @MONTH1 contain degrading comments to men and/or women. I wouldn't want my child listening to this type of music, or reading any book that talks about it. Music @MONTH1 also be offensive to cultures, religion, sexual orientation and race. Books or music with comments such as that should have notes written on them stating what they contain. I was reading a book called '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', that i had picked up in the child section. After the first chapter I had wondered who who call this a children book. The character was using profanity and talking about sex the whole time. My child shouldn't be looking for a book on pie then find out its not about pie.     I once was watching a movie with my two year old that we got from the library. The movie was full of inappropriate words, therefore I had to shut it off. Movies like that should not be on the shelf at the library for my child to view. I now have to worry about what we check out. I also have had a few bad reading experiences. Magazines is a big one. Some magazines @MONTH1 contain content such as innappropriate pictures and words. Magazines should stay at the grocery store rather then a library that I take my child to.     Books, music, movies and magazines should stay out of the childrens section if they are only meant for adult viewing keep them in the adult section. Any parent would tell you that they don't agree with some of the stuff on your local library shelf today. Offendsive content shouldn't be found in the library at all. I know now to keep a better eye on what my child is reading.",4,4,4,2
3369,2,"All kid's have their own style of books, @CAPS1 people like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that to an offense? We should think of how taking @CAPS1 books off the shelf would affect more then one person, @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 be mature enough to read the more 'grown up' books or magazines, libraries have all types of syles for different people, you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you.         I do not agree that @CAPS1 books and or magazines can be taken offensive. All libraries are different  types of books,for example  an elemantry school library they will not have grown up or teenager books, and a middle school will not have little kid books. We also have to think does peer presure effect what books or magaiznes kids read? , for example when I was in middle school my friends were all reading romance books, and I was still reading @ORGANIZATION1, and I had to change my reading style to fit in, so that's exactly what I did.      Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf, I believe that if there is 'offensive' books in your library, just ignore them you @CAPS2't have to get that book, we cant just take the more grown up books out because @CAPS1 kids @CAPS2't know what their suppose to be reading. Libraries have all different style of books to fit everyone's taste, so just look for that right book that suites you, and @CAPS2't take all the books that have an offensive style of the shelf, @CAPS2't judge a book by it's cover",3,3,3,1

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' - @PERSON1     If one thinks about it books are such a magical escape from everday life. They can take one anywhere they want to go at anytime. Imagine a world where books are a luxury or where they are simply not present at all.I feel as if this would become an all too real reality if we censor books.      Where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be @CAPS5 or placed into circulation. This would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing. So much would be left unsaid. I believe the quote stated above is quite true. If we place censorship on one book everyone has a right to ban other books as well. Just because certain books, movies, and magazines are deemed offensive to some, does not mean they should be banned for all. No one should we withheld from a book due to age, race, gender, or any other factor.      If one has ever been prohibited from doing something due to age or size the feeling is not pleasant.No one neccessarily said anything mean or hurtful it just feels as if restritions and boundaries were set for no particular reason. I have felt this way multiple times. I remember one time in particular. I went to @LOCATION1 with a group of my cousins and their friends. Since I was the youngest I was also the shortest. I could not ride many of the rides there due to my size. I knew why those heighth requirements were set, for my personal safety. This makes sense, but why should one be required to be a certain age to watch a movie or watch a tv show. Honestly some people are more mature than others and grow up faster. Everyone is different. Everyone has a different personality and different perspective, there is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different. One should not be ineligible to @CAPS5 a book or magazine or watch a movie. Not wanting to is totally differnet from not getting to.       The popular book To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 was banned at one time in the @LOCATION2 simply for using the 'n-word'. This angers many especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 affected and shaped us into who we are today. America is a great nation because of the @ORGANIZATION1.Do we need to have a @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5!Why should we restrict ourselves and limit our own personal freedoms?  If anything is to be banned, I believe it is censorship",4,4,4,2
3372,2,"Yes, I think they should be removed from the shevles. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overated and young children go to visit the library. They should have a shelve for kids, tennagers and grown-ups. Everybody should have they own section for their age group.          Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street, hang with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies, when they should be watching something educational. The music they have out now days, children shouldn't listen to it. It's to much cursing and violent. More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things.          There are certain things tennagers should watch and read too. I don't think they should read about killing or sex. I rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them. Parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors, they been through everything you doing or trying to do now. So just talk to them and be real about things.          I think they should be certain magazines in the library. Young children beat theyselves up, because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines. They try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be. Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt. Then, young men want to have big mucles and be buff.          In conclusion, I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves. There should be a shelve for young kids, tennages and adults. The music that is played on the radio now days, shouldn't be on there. Magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach. There are certain things tennagers should watch and read.",3,3,3,1
3375,2,"I think libraries shouldn't removed material from the shelves even thoug its offensive. The libraries should't removed offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people other people still might want to learn about that topic. For an example the @CAPS1 didn't like the @CAPS2. In some books its has some offensive stuff about @CAPS2 that were stated by @CAPS4. Some @CAPS2 might take that offensive but other people from diffrent race or relegion might want to learn about what was said. Just because people read about it doesne't mean all of them are going to agree with it. People might have their own point of view, no one has there right of telling one person what they can or can't like.      If cenorship starts to occur in libraries or other in other communtiy places, I think people are going to get mad and might have a bigger problem than some people being offensded of their material. They might think that they are being told of what they can or can't read,listen,or believe in.That will occur a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious. I think it will be simplier if library haves the materials on shelves and people who are getting offended of what they have in there should ignore it because why will they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious? They might be offended of what one person says but who cares, not everyone is going to think or agree of what is being said. Its just a person point of view let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves  and in your believes. Not everyone is right and perfect just be youselves",3,3,3,1
3383,2,"For many students it is hard to compose essay's in a public school's library. Aquiring the neccisary information is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack. This is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff. No neither of these problems is the cause behind many student's inabiltiy to compose thought provoking essay and analysis over a myrad of topics. This is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general. Many of the relevent topics and materials need to truely understand our constantly changing world is being removed from the grasp of those who will go on to lead this new world.Some prime examples of this tyrany on knowledge is the removal of books suck as @PERSON1, @PERSON2, the @CAPS1, and many other classical works. Each of these according to many parents has good reason to be removed from our libraries. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy along with being written by what @CAPS3 has pegged as one of the humanity's most vile of creatures. @PERSON2 uses racial surrs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children. The @CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state. Many other classical works refference racism, drugs, murder, sex and use rampant profanity. All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent @MONTH1 advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries.These reasons, as well meaning as they @MONTH1 be, are no longer good enough to be valid in todays changing environment. Many of the books that have been recomneded to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle. As we know, '@CAPS3 is written by the victors.' @CAPS4 it is good that the @CAPS5 won the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and helped abolish slavery it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the view point from our centers of knowledge. To forget is to remember at another time. That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again.For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbiden images to their children more than books have. To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world. Just because we try and close our eyes to the realities of the world does not mean that they don't exist. It is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb",5,4,5,3
3384,2,"Should offensive material be removed from the library? I think no, and there are many reasons as to why I disagree with this idea. Many books, movies, and magazines are not ment to offend people, but just to let the reader know how the author feels. I think that the books, movies, magazines, etc. should stay on the shelf because if they are removed what are we left with? Seems like all that would remain would be the dictonary. I think that when Katherine Paterson said, 'Children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that she was making a big mistake.      So what seems to be offensive to people? Topics such as gosip and politics are a gold mine for authors in the @DATE1. Yet people find these topics to be offense probably due to that persons backround. If aomeone find a read to be offensive, then they should stop reading and that be it. Instead, people deside to go on a rampage against that magazine or whatever they read and what it banned for life from others to read. Readers have the choice to read whatever they want and if they disagree with that subject, just move on with their lifes.      At the library I attend many poeple different shapes and sizes walk through the door everyday. Many of them like a different subject then the others, so its commen to find everybody reading about a different topic. Sure someone here and there does not gree with an author, but never decide to go crazy about it. Instead they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves. People read what they want to so they can enjoy it, not to bash the wuthor for his writing.          In my own read's, I have found at times stuff i disagree with. Instead of going off the deep end and getting all excited about it, I choose to think about where the author is coming from and try to understand his side. On the other hand, some movies are ment to be for one type of audience when instead another audience see's the material. This still should not get movies or whatever the material is banned from the library. When on the box it says rated for teenagers and up, that means it is not for a four year old to watch and their parents get mad at them for it. If people followed what the box says and listen to the guidlines, then there would be no problem.     I disagree with @PERSON2 when she said that some books, magazines, movies, etc. should be removed from the library. People have the right to read anything and to see anything they want, and if they disagree well they should just deal with it. In my own exprience, I have not found there to be a problem in my community library with people wanting content removed. Once people start following guidlines and reading the boxes and still disagree, then maybe will have something then. But until then, we should keep our nations libraries the way they are today",4,4,4,2
3386,2,"Have you ever imagined a @CAPS1 without movies or music to entertain you? A @CAPS1 that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the @CAPS1, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently.     In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it.     Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc.. Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts.     I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive. If specific materials are banned: creativity will be eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self expression. If you haven't ever thought about a @CAPS1 without books, moves, music or magazines; I hope you have learned how crule and boring the @CAPS1 would be without all of those materials.",4,4,4,2
3394,2,"What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across @LOCATION1.  Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a difference between vulger and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library.      A public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is different and have their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc. for them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be simple. For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter. These different sections could include Children's, @CAPS1, and many more different titles. This set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4'.  Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as school libraries.     School libraries are a whole different idea. School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic acheivement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulger items can be interesting and educational. It is all a part of growing up.          The censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to. If a family with young children want to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, @PERSON1, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone.",3,4,3,1
3403,2,"Have you ever been to a library? Have you ever thought that some material from the libraries could and have been found offensive and wanted them to be removed from the library? I'm here to talk about the content of libraries and what we should do with them.           Every time you walk into a library, you are surrounded with books and other learning or reading material. Yes this material is helpfull in finding things to pass the time or to help understand a certain subject, but some have been found offensive. Stories such as romance novels or vulgar horror and action stories have been viewed as innapropriet to some ages. These novels contain anything from brutal horror, to adult material, or foul language. Parents argue that these books should be removed from the libraries.      I do not agree. I beleive that such books and novels can be a great help to the immagination of others and get the mind flowing. Yes i do agree that some novels are not age apropriate for young children, but that does'nt mean that they should be removed. I think that if people are so worried about their children reading these books that they should either go into the library with their child, or simply give the child a certain area that they are allowed to pick a book from.      Another way of avoiding these wrightings getting into the wrong hands is to section off the more aggressive and adulterated books to a certain spot in the library and allow only age apropriate people inside. An age restriction of thirteen years and up would be a responsible decision. An age younger could be innapropriate for them, but any older and it could keep them from learning and expanding their mind to it's full potential.     The point of this writing is to show that removing these books and novels from the libraries is not going to help anything. if anything it could hurt us by not allowing our minds to reach newer and higher limmets by learning and understanding the complexity of these novels. sectioning off these novels in an age apropriate area or having parental discression will help to keep the age correct for the books that they get",3,3,3,1
3410,2,"I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music,            magazines, ect should be removed from the shelves.              Libraries or any place else. I believe that if someone wanted to          know more information about something the library or the @CAPS2 should be able to provide it for them. Imagine if the           Libraries and the @CAPS1 started putting these materials away, many people wouldnt bother to go to either. The @CAPS2 in my      eyes is a place that shows me where we have been, what we have been threw, and things we have accomplished while we           have been there.In the @CAPS1 could you imagine walking around touring seeing nothing about you past?,'No, I couldn't.          Eventhough things @MONTH1 seem offensive in ones eyes, it could be the history of anothers.

I believe that everyone has a right to know what has                happened in their pass to have gotten to their future, so taking away information that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone           else isn't fair. I believe that we should keep all information in lilbraries, @CAPS1, art shows because everything has it's on history behind it, and if we just cover it up we will never know.

3412,2,"Offensive @CAPS1 @CAPS2     @CAPS3 entering a @CAPS1 you know your are going to find something interesting to read,listen to, or even watch. Most people use librarys to find information on a certain topic, some of these topics are not always appropiate for certain age groups. I do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now. Most kids go to the @CAPS1 and look to find books that interest them, sometimes they cross book about stuff they should'nt know about yet. Libraries should be allowed to have anything on there shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups.     @CAPS3 you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing, you might have passes by many books about racism. As a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read. That kid just went from reading abot nascar to reading about racism and different races. I believe that book should be kept in order of age. @CAPS3 a teenager goes into the @CAPS1 to look up a book, they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on there topic. In most libraires there are topics such as sex, killing , and viloent matters. Kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it.     If I am at the @CAPS1 I will always look for a book interest me. My skills on choosing books for myself has changed since i was @NUM1 or @NUM2. Now that older and like to read, I read more books about action and mystery. I was at the our hometown @CAPS1 and saw a @NUM3 year old kid looking at books about pregnancy and was shocked to see what he was reading after he put the book down. That same day I came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing. @CAPS3 I saw this I was suprised to see what was happening. I do believe that libraries should be able to showcase what they have but in certain age sections..     Kids visit the @CAPS1 all the time and looking for books to strike interest and will always find something different that they should not be exposed too. Libraires would have trouble containg what kids read, so they should exposed all the differnt topics. @CAPS3 your little and your reading about these topics, you will then be more informed @CAPS3 your just little older.     Next time @CAPS3 you visit the @CAPS1 check and see what kids in your local towe are talking and reading about. You will be suprised @CAPS3 a child apporachs his parents with a book about sex. I think that all libraies should exposed what they want @CAPS3 they want to ensure knowledge to everyone.",4,4,4,2
3421,2,"@PERSON1, an author, once said; 'All of use can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In other words, she @CAPS2 prooving the fact that books should not be censored in any form of way, in which I take the affirmative side on.      To begin with, censorship @CAPS2 simply the banning of certain things that are thought to be offensive. An example of this would be the society in the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1' by @PERSON2. In this book, @PERSON3, the main character and eventually the protagonist, @CAPS2 a firefighter that cause fires instead of putting them out. The government believes that books are dangerous because they cause people to become knowledgable so as a result, they order people to burn them, making society ignorant and a potential 'slave' to their government. Despite loosing his job and almost being killed by the goverment, @PERSON3 rises to understand that books have true meaning and that what the government @CAPS2 doing @CAPS2 wrong.      This topic now poses a question: '@CAPS2 all censorship bad?' Of course not. Some censorship should be allowed as a matter of fact. For example, any form of media whether it @CAPS2 books or magazines that portreys hatred toward a certain religion or group should be censored by the government because according to our constitution, people have the right to believe and practice whatever they wish (also know as 'freedom of speech'). However, the majority of censorship does not take a good side. In the political world today, censorship @CAPS2 applied to people who speak out against their government or leader due to the fact that they had been dishonest or ruthless to the people. Even in our country today, the government applies this which in some cases violates the constitution because people have the freedom of speech, but to a certain extent only.      Overall, the negative outcomes of censorship outweigh the positive outcomes. Censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it @CAPS2 wrong. On the other had, censorship towards things that portey hatred @CAPS2 not bad either. In conclusion however, bad censorship causes people to become uneducated, at the end resulting in pure ignorance.",4,4,4,2

In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so.     Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writers words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future.      Imagine the impact if the @CAPS4 had locked away every copy of the @CAPS5 because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. It would be a would far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place.     While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading '@ORGANIZATION1', they definantly should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music @MONTH1 have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they @MONTH1 speak a message. To a creationist @PERSON1's views @MONTH1 seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they @MONTH1 be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own.      We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others.

As for music and movies that could be place in the same catogoery can be reasonable.

If they took out every book, music, movies, and magazines that people thought were offensive then I bet alot of them would be out and that wouldnt be fair to other people because maybe they want or listen or read or watch them and they would be really mad if they found out they was taken out because other peoplr thought they were offensive.  Some people would probably understand that some of those could hurt someones feelings or be offensive to other people but then theres other ones that dont care.     I think that some of them should be taken out if they are really bad and I wouldn't want other little kids reading them and gettin their feelings hurt or anything but if there not that bad then I don't they should be gone and I don't think people would really care if those stayed in them.  If thiers ones that are really bad and if they stayed in the libraries then probably no one would want to come back to the libraries and sooner or later less and less people would stop going.

3440,2,"Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also @CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the @ORGANIZATION1, it @ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we @CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines @MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our @ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information?     Another topic in the @ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that @MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, @MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.     As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated @CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.     In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case",4,4,4,2
3443,2,"Censorship or not? That is the question. Many people @MONTH1 not realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them. If children watch a scary movie, then nightmares seem to occur more often. If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad  things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good. What if @CAPS2 article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas? Most people would be offended and complain. I fyou saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit. So then the question is arised, why is it alright for us to watch movies like @CAPS2? Yes, books and movies should be censored.     Children are very naive at a young age. When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it's okay. For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems. I saw my favorite actors on @CAPS2 movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright. It's not okay for a child to talk offensively like that. One day I even heard a little @LOCATION2 quoting lines from the '@CAPS3.' @CAPS2 movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It made me sad to hear an innocent little @LOCATION2 talking about things that are way over his head.      Teenagers that listen to music from @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 are getting bad messages. Although these two rappers are seen as modern day music heroes, they shouldn't be glorified the way they are. They're songs are all about smoking weed and getting high. They make it seem cool. So teenagers think, '@CAPS5 if they can do it, so can I!' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon. If teenagers were't exposed to @CAPS2 kind of music, they wouldn't be as apt to take part in such things.      As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too. One @MONTH1 think that once they're older they can do waht they want, but that's not the case. Let me throw out an example to you. Let's just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together. It's great until a rather, inappropriate ,shall we say, scene comes on. Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right. They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinant until marriage. After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases.      If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha. People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong. We are on the brink of violence and total chaos. If we contiue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot,things will get ugly. Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds",4,4,4,2
3446,2,"The quote that Katherine Paterson declairs a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in anothers point of view.     Everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. For instance, their clothing. Belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. So what do you think? Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think its offensive or terrible? In my opinion, no. Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyones personal thoughts. For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disguisting and cruel. I have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict.     During the years of my seventh grade experience there was this playstation game that i loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. My mother, and pretty much the entire @LOCATION1 found it very offensive. It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things i loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. Now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me? I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. That's like taking somebody possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rote and vanish forever.      I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taking off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. If you dont like the novel, then i assist you to return it, and to never read it again. I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable. So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?",4,3,4,2
3450,2,"While their are many books written out thier @MONTH1 offened many types of people thier are some that just need to be wipped off the face of the earth, those who do not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. That is one of my favorite quotes and i don't use it lightly. Take from example 'The @ORGANIZATION1' the very book that gives instructions to build bombs, teaches you how to use firearms etc. this book is all about hate amongst people we don't fully understand like thier religion and how they look. This book frankly makes me sick to the stomach. Thats why i think this book needs to be taken of the shelves for good, thier was alos hate properganda in the books about how the @CAPS1 shouldn't be alive and that's disgusting i would be able to sleep better at night knowing this book was gone.     One other book that should be taken off the shelves is a book written by none other than one other @PERSON1 the man that put so many people into gas chambers and many others to thier undeserved graves. He sent men, women, and childeren to his many death camps and work camps. One of those many childern was @PERSON2 who was in hiding from the gustappo or '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'. Because of this monster the @CAPS7 lost one of the worlds greatest and most deappest writers for the @DATE1's. This book was filled with hate messages and how the @CAPS4 people shouldn't be allowed to live amongst the 'supposed' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. But if we did no have this book we would be sure to expect another @CAPS8 on our hands.     All in all censorship in the libraries should be a rule but to only the books worth keeping not these horrific Books",3,3,3,1
3452,2,"Do you think that certain books should not be shared with certain poeple? In all honesty yes, let them read and listen to whatever they think is interesting. No matter what the content that the book or @CAPS1 contains it's their choice, there is a power called freedom in this world. One might think that if you are able to read and comprehend the words that are wrote in that book or sang in a song, then yes read and listen to anything you want.     If a young person such as a kindergartener picks up a book about sex you know there is no way that child will be able to comprehend it. So yes any books should be left on the shelf at libraries, open to anyone and everyone who are willing to read them. Its not that you have to be mature enough to read a book its that you have to understand it and are able to read to get what the book is trying to say. Yes some things parents don't want their children to know, but this world is filled with awful things and they are bound to figure some of those horrible things out sooner or later. Reading and music lets you learn and experience different situations that you might have never been in before. Both books and songs are a way to express yourself and everyone should express theirself in some way.     When it comes to movies that's a different story. Those movies are rated for a reason. On a rated @CAPS2 film i could see @NUM1 year olds on up watching it, because by then those kids have been in high school and everything sexual and perverted have been put into their little heads. Also most have been in sex education class. Blood and all things cruel have been talked about and heard about too. So yes let @NUM1 year olds on up watch rated @CAPS2 films. The one thing that isn't suggested is taking a little kid to see a film that isn't rated for them. Say a parent took a @NUM3 year old to see a scarry movie, more than likely that child is going to be scared and scarred from see blood, stabbing, and sexual content.    Movies should be left rated for whom they should be rated for. When it comes to music and books, they are wonderful learning tools also good for expression of ones self. So learn, experience, and express. No matter what your interested in freedom was gave to you so use it",3,4,3,1
3453,2,"I enjoy reading very much so and I have read several books since I've been in highschool. Three of the best books I have read through my high school career were about drugs, rape, partying, and had innepropriate language in them.      Some parents would not like their children reading those books and would ask for them to be taken out of our school library, but I think that is completely wrong. We have  freedom of speech and press so why can't those books be in our school libraries? What some parents think are offensive, others might not. Most of the time children disagree with their parents anyways so they are going to read whatever they want to read, or watch what they want, or even listen to what they want.      People are different and we have a right to our own opinions. Some parents would say that those kinds of books should be taken out of the library but that's wrong, if you don't like them then don't read them, or discourage your kids from reading them. It's just a book, it's not like it's actually happening. Books are separated by age too, so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate. Teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books.      I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from our libraries because a select few people think their offensive, that takes books away from people who enjoy reading those kinds of books. Then if all kinds of people are saying everything is offensive there will be no more books left on the shelf for people who don't think their offensive.When I am an adult I will tell my children what I expect from them and let them make their own choices because no matter what they will anyways and if they want to read a book with bad language in it, or a movie with language then so be it. It's not like they're actually doing what's going on in the book. Overall I think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive",4,4,4,2
3456,2,"I believe that some materail should be remove if very offensive. I also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf. Everyone, has different thoughts about was is offensive or apropreate and whats not.  Also, everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books,music,movies,magazines, and so on are apropreate. Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be apropreate for them.And the liabary should put warning stickers on  the book, so that person knows the graphic or voulgur language. Therefore, I beleive that the laibaries should put warning signs on anything to reduce less books being removed from the shelfs.   And so forth my decision is to not remove certain materail, only if offensive. The liabaries should use warning stickers on books so that person knows ahead of time about the graphic or voulgur language. I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our liabaries. Even thought alot of people will dis agree, this is what I believe should happen.  Heres why I believe this should happen. One day when I was younger just starting to read I came across a book. I was reading it to my mother then she takes the book away and gives it to the liabarean and told what happen. I guess I said a very inapropeate word and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it. So, now everytime my mother takes my younger brothers to the liabary she makes sure the book they want are apropeate for there age group so the same incadent wont happen again.wouldnt you be the same way with your children? I know I would not just for my kids but for other children also",3,3,3,1
3458,2,"Hello! My name is @PERSON1. I am writting to you @DATE1 because their is so much conflict on the issue of 'if materials in the library are offensive should they be removed from their shelves'. I know their are people that will agree or disagree but what i think they should do is leave them. Yes i said it they should stay wright where they are.     People all over this world get themselves worked up over all the little things in life but what we dont understand is their is always gonna be something in life we dont like and thats never going to change. Like this for example, people taking offense to materials in the library and wonting them to be removed. I mean come on people wake up and realize you are not always going to have things as you wont them theirs always going to be things you just have to deal with it.      I believe that these types of materials should stay wright where their at because people can over look them we just decied not to. We all make a big deal over something so small. People should just not look at it and move on dont sit their and fuss about it just turn around and walk away just because you dont like it dosent mean that others dont. Everybody in this world needs to see that their are things were not going to like but we have to get over them and move on. This will always happen and theirs nothing we can do about it.     All over the universe people @MONTH1 agree or disagree with what i have to say but its your perspective and what you think about it is your choice. I  will say though that they should stay but people need to get over themselves and see the truth in life and know that even though their are things we dont like dont sit their and argue about it just leave it and go your own way.     So this is my essay to you. People need to see their always not going to get what they want in life but they need to move on. Like this if you have a problem with the things around you such as taking offense to materials in the library and wonting them removed well sorry but no. learn to walk away from it because what you like @MONTH1 not be what others like and what they like @MONTH1 not be what you like we just have to go on with life leave it be because others oppinons @MONTH1 not match yours . Leave the materials alone because we as people need to see where not always going to get our way in life and to take hold of learning how to blow it off instead of making a big deal about something so little we could of walked away from",4,4,4,2
3466,2,"What is censorship? Cenorship can be described as limitations or restrictions, and it can aslo be called common courtsy. The real question is what are we limiting?   Censorship is not something to support. Censorship to a book is like chocolate cake without the chocolate, its taking away the value and fun out of education. Though many @MONTH1 disapprove, libraries shouldn't censor their books, movies, or music because of that.      Some @MONTH1 find that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON1' are offensive books because of their repeated use of the '@CAPS4' word. There is also some arguement to that, there are several @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that I know that find the '@CAPS4' word offensive, but not in this case. They say that it brings more educational value to the book, because in the day of @PERSON1 the '@CAPS4' word was an excepted word. Thats just how it was back then.     Back then and now censorship is hiding reality. People who write, sing, and direct things that are considerd 'inapropriate' are the ones who are trying to set the truth free. The 'inapropriate' language, or experiences are the ones that really happen and are the words that are really said. By using censorship you are sheltering the world.      Cesorship is tool we use to block ourselves from reality. Is that the right choice? Is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves? Or should we let them understand how it really works",3,3,3,1
3467,2,"Censorship    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chldren have taken off the shef. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work I abhor -then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 was quoted from an author named Katherine Paterson. I don't believe certain materials such as books should be removed from shelves under any circumstances. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials. If books are removed from the shelves due to censorship, than what is the point of writing or even reading books? If people continue to remove books because they're found to be offensive, then there won't be any books left to read.     I have seen many offensive books. Whether it had something to do with religious beliefs or even revealing too much sexual content, I'm sure it's offensive to someone somewhere. Books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing. If you are to take away or ban a certain book from the shelf, than what would the author who wrote the book think? @CAPS1 world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books. It can't be right to just get rid of those things because they bother us. Everyone has the right to read any book they want to. Just because it offends one person, doesn't mean it offends everyone.     I believe censorship is unnessesary. What gives anyone the right to remove or change something because it's inappropriate? I have personally read a few books that I wouldn't want little kids to read but that doesn't mean I should remove it from the shelves. Perhaps, somebody else has been waiting to find that book. If I did remove it than I'm restricting others from experiencing the joys of reading that book.      Censorship in general is wrong. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves. I don't believe anyone has the right to take something, that someone has worked on for so long to make, and remove it because they find it offensive. There will always be something out there that you won't approve of. Just because you don't approve of it doesn't mean everybody doesn't approve. Authors write books for a reason, musicians write music for a reason, people make movies and magazines for a reason. What gives anyone the right to take something that somebody made and ban it from the rest of the world because it's offensive?     Books are there to help us become more educated and more open minded towards different thoughts and ideas. We shouldn't just ban them because they offend certain people. If you don't like a book because it offends you, than don't read it. It's just that simple. If people continue to remove books because they're offensive, then there won't be any books left to read.",4,4,4,2
3468,2,"If someone is looking for an offensive book, they are going to find it, whether it's collecting dust on a library shelf or is brand new in a book store. The same goes for an offensive @CAPS1, magazine, or movie. Removing the offensive items from library shelves will only cause the people searching for these items to look elsewhere.      Different people have different opinions on what is offensive and what is not offensive. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs. While many people found The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 offensive, others enjoyed the story. If the book had been removed from libraries because some people found it offensive, then others who really enjoyed the book would not have been able to read it.     Another reason libraries should not remove offensive items from their shelves is that, most likely, the entire book, magazine, movie, etc. is not offensive the whole way through. Even if a movie has one offensive scene in it, the rest of the movie could be a great story that many people would benefit from seeing. It is the same idea with a book or magazine. There @MONTH1 be a few offensive chapters or one or two offensive articles, but very rarely will you find a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive the whole way through.      Of course, there are still offensive items that would be bad for younger kids to see even with the one or two offensive scenes, chapters, or article. There are easier solutions to this problem than having to remove the items from the shelves completely. One solution to this problem could be for libraries to put age limits on certain items, so that younger kids can't check out materials that are too innapropriate. But more importantly, this would be the job of the parents to monitor what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to.      Removing offensive books, magazines, music, and movies from the shelves of libraries would just cause more problems and complaints. I think it is a good idea to leave the material on the library shelves and caution library users to 'read at their own risk.'",4,4,4,2
3469,2,"Censorship in school libraries is important, but at the same time it is not necessary. I believe that many books in the school library are not apropriate for younger children, but these same books should not be taken out of our libraries becuase I feel like high schoolers are mature enough to be reading this material. The material in this books are no differnt than what goes on in the high school years.      Most of these books give a prospective on real life stories and @MONTH1 be able to help someone cope and realize that they are not alone. At the same time though many of these books do contain curse words, some sexual scenes, partying, drinking, and doing drugs. These books are too old for a elementary school age child and maybe even a middle school age child to be reading. For example the books by @PERSON1, these books are about a girl who becomes addicted to drugs, pregant, in jail, and homeless. I read these books, they are really good books, and they showed me how by just trying one drug, one time, could ruin your whole life. I learned a lot from these books, but I don't think that anyone younger than fourteen should be reading them.       There should be a limit on the censorship. Many things talked about in the books, are the same things talked about in the school hallways, what is the difference? That is why authors write about the things they do, so they can conect with teenagers. Many books are an authors experience, so they are meant for high school age. Many authors will put an age level on their books, like fourteen and older. Librabries should pay attention to these ratings before putting the books in the libraries.      Someone @MONTH1 become offened by what they read in a book, but I don't think that book should be taken off the shelf becuase of one person. If it becomes a bigger issue, than yes it should be taken off, but at the same time, that one book @MONTH1 be someone else's way from escaping the hardships in their life.     Many adults would disagree with my statements becuase they feel like if a teenager is reading about someone drinking, do drugs, or having sex, then they are more likely to do those things. I feel like this is not true becuase the book I am reading now, they are partying and drinking, but I'm not out doing that. What is the differnce between someone reading it in a book and seeing it on television? I see many worse things on the @LOCATION1 than I read in books. Parents should be happy that their teenager is reading and not playing video games or out with friends.     These are just my oppinons, some people @MONTH1 agree with me and others @MONTH1 disagree, but I am going to stick with my oppinons",4,4,4,2
3470,2,"Censorship in Libraries.                                                                           Censorship is a big conflict in many libraries. @CAPS2 are plenty of offensive books that shouldn't be put on the shelves.  Many schools call these books, magazines, and movies, '@CAPS1.'  @CAPS2 is often a week where people read all of the books that have been @CAPS1 from school libraries.  I participate in this school wide challenge beacause I disagree with banning books.  Banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons.     First off, I like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view.  How would you feel if you spent around @NUM1 years writing this story/movie for kids that got @CAPS1 in the first couple of weeks it was on the shelves.  I don't think that many people would enjoy that.  I also think that many people don't think of authors at that big of a deal.  When I think of that it makes me think of all the things we couldn't read in our world. Including, newspapers, books, and magizines.  Maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear, or see.  I feel like when books or movies get @CAPS1 or removed, it makes the author feel like they're worth nothing.  The parents point of view makes things a lot worse.      Think of it this way, your child comes home from school with this book that he/she wants you to read with him.  You sit down and start reading, when suddenly you come across a violent or inappropriate secne in the story.  You stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story!  What do you do?             Many parents would call the school and explain what happened and complain about banning this book and taking it away from children that could get this book.  Taking it away has no point because just banning it from the school library doesn't mean that they can't find it elsewhere.  How do you think your child would feel having loved this story now it's gone?  I know that it would make me feel like I did something wrong.  Taking things off shelves also has a good side to it.      When you take the book, movie or magizine off the shelf it is gone forever from that library.  This can be a good thing because then kids won't have the obvious reason to get the story.  If you don't want your child or other children to see it then it is quite a good idea.  It makes the @CAPS1 object harder to find and also harder for the kids to grab intrest to.  If the book or movie isn't around then they won't want to read the next one or see the next movie. @CAPS2 are many different views on censorship, which could effect how people choose what happens in libraries.     My view on this topic was negitive and I support that fully.  If the author works hard on writing the story they shouldn't get punished for expressing their feelings in a story. Many different poeple come across this issue and @CAPS2 are many different views on the topic.  Next @CAPS1 book week I'll be supporting the authors that got crushed by their work getting @CAPS1.  I hope that you will too.",4,4,4,2
3471,2,"Censorship in public libraries, allowed? I believe it should be, with a few different veiw points. For one, why should the books come off of shelves because some people do not like the plot of the series? Two, @CAPS1 is over a million of us people out @CAPS1 and we all are not a like in many ways. Also @CAPS2, reading is one of those things that we differ with each other. One person might read peaceful warm-hearted stories, than you have people out @CAPS1 like want something more intense to be able to read.      With all of us being different all over the world. Humans have different taste in food, music, movies, and books. All people have different ways to satisfy their pleasures in book readings, to me books are like religons not all of us are the same in that, and at the same time we are all freely living with our reglion without any punichment, so why would you take away books that people love to read freely?  To me, in my eyes is just not right. It's like taking candy away from a innocent baby because it will rot it's teeth out. What I mean by that is, that sure some books to people @MONTH1 offend them yet their might be some people out @CAPS1 being offensive to that persons books and so on, but as all as your baby's teeth aren't rotting out, than why take the candy away? Meaning if the books have each individal shelf with labels on what it was all about, which they do. People wouldn't feel so offensive finding them in the wrong spot.     Looking at the point of veiws do you understand where I come from with this? We are all the same, yet in books we find each other inside of them, finding ourselves into books, I know many book readers with different types of tastes. No matter who they were and who their friends were, we all are different. To many people other than myself, would agree with that. So tell me again why should censorship not be in public libraries",3,3,3,1
3472,2,"Books are a form of history, each telling a story from the past. in history we dont block any offensive events that take place so why should we removed any books that have offensive material in them. it would be wrong to strip the kids of any learning tools.          books are a very important learning tool in todays schools and there is somthing new in every book that a kid can learn from. so even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing. and doing this on purpose would  be aginst everything that schools stand for.          there are many diffrent janras of books, but not everybody loves every jonra if a person only likes to read young adult books because it relates to there culture, wich most likely will have  offensive language and events play out. if you were to take this away from a youngadult in school; once more this person would be missing out on books because nows they are not intersted at any of the books in the libary.       if you can even think of just one instance that could strip a student away from a learning opertunity you shouldnt do it. but the fact is there any many reasons why you shouldnt remove any literture from libary shelves",3,3,3,1
3475,2,"I as a student, a child and a citizen of of the united states believes that every book, should be allowed in any library.  Books, express feelings, emotions ect., the same thing with movies, music.  I we don't have them how will we be able to learn anything in this world. Each book out there has an explanation, a title and a reason to be read.  Today millions of poeple read more ad more because of all the books out there.            I do believe however the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different.  It doesn't matter what the books about, some might seem offensive but everyone has something that they dislike.  There are many poeple out there that get deffensive over things, for example certain people, animals, countries, different skin colors, cursing and even sports.  We all have our own opinions, if you do not like a certain book because it has a content that you don't like then it's simple don't read it, others might like it.  Movies, books, music, magazines, etc., should be allowed anywhere",2,3,2,0
3476,2,"Dear newspaper,     In my opinion I don't think that censorship in libraries should be on materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines and more materials. Censoring materials in the library could resolve in many problems. I don't agree with the censorship in libraries on materials for many reasons. In my upcoming paragraphs, I will explain why I diagree with libraries having censorship on a lot of their materials.     Many libraries in the world @MONTH1 have censoring on their materials. I believe that libraries have alot of censoring on most of their materials due to the fact that they @MONTH1 have children under the age of eighteen constantly viewing a lot of explicent content. Libraries shouldn't censor their materials but in my opinion they also shouldn't let under age children check out any kind of material that is only ment to be viewed by adults. Also if computer access is offered to children, an adult superior visor should be near by to make sure that no explicent content is being viewed.     Censoring in libraries could resolve in many problems, such as, customers not getting all the information they need for a centain material, children not reading up to their abilities or standards, and also children not learning enough or getting information that they need for school. If all of these things happen prior to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials then many libraries will not get as any customers. Yes, most people @MONTH1 visit libraries for the wrong reasons but to other people, those wrong reasons @MONTH1 be the reason for them to gain more information.     Materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people. But what's found offensive to most people could be found useful to other people. If something is found offensive to one person I don't think it should be removed from the shelves. If books and or materials are removed from the shelves, that can hide so much useful information that people could gain.      In conclusion, I don't think censorship should be put on materials in libraries due to the fact that many information could be lost. Censorship doesn't always mean that the material is bad, it can also mean that the material is just not appropreite to be viewed or read by that certain age group. If a library that I visit has censoring on most of their materials, I would convince the library staff to take the censoring off. Censoring is not always bad and it's not always good either but it can hide alot of information from us which is not good at all.",3,3,3,1
3477,2,"I think that all books, music,movies,magazines, and anything thats offensive should be took off shelves because @CAPS1 are lil kids that read books and they dont need to hear or reed offensive things. But at the same time for the peope that do wanna hear or reed things like that then their should be a area in the librarie for materials like that.                    @CAPS1 are all kinds of libraries that have offensive books,movies,magazines other reasons they should take offensive materials off the shelves because it could be racist or just offening certin things and people don't wanna see or reed about white people hating black people or black people hating white people or any type of racist things. It shouldnt be alounded because it can hurt someones feelings.                  I have my own observations with reading some books from my school librarie and have came acrossed some words that was offensive. like in some books they use the word nigger and since im black it's offensive to me i know that they are not saying it to me but they still say it and it kinda touches me in a way. Im not sayin that it is offensive towards all people but it is me so the way they could is like i said instead of having offensive books out on shelves they should have one area where materials like that could be found in stead of having the material where childeren  and other people will get offened.           The last thing i wanna talk about is that for childeren and other people they dont wanna see nasty things that are in books if i had a kid i wouldnt want my childeren too c nasty things that could be offensive to. @CAPS1 books also that talk about drugs and people dont wanna hear or read about that it. but @CAPS1 are some people also that do wanna see or read about things like that like older people they have diffent point of views about things so thats why again @CAPS1 should be one area in libraries for materials like that.     In conclustion i think that @CAPS1 should hear me out and take in what i have to say because the material thats are in books,music, or magazines can be offensive to anybody any race could be offened by what they see or read so again @CAPS1 should be a place in libraries for that",3,3,3,1
3478,2,"Censorship is a big part of a lot of things at the library. There are books, movies, magazines, and computers that anyone that want to get on can do so. Kids love to go to the library to get books and just hang out with friends. Strict parents might believe that books, magazines, and music are offensive and should not be at the library, But that isn't what everyone else thinks.       I believe people have different views about things. There are people that think there kids seeing bad things will make them want to do it. Others think there kids seeing those offensive things will make them learn from it. Another thing that people believe is bad in libraries is the talking. Not everyone that goes to the library wants to just sit and not talk to anyone. Most people do not go to libraries because of that.      Libraries are fun to go to. You can just about get any book there you want to read. There is no point for any parent to be worried about there child reading a book that isnt for there age group, because libraries are very good at having the sections labled for age groups. They also would not be able to check out the book because the staff there are good at making sure it isnt a book that shouldnt be read by that person. Also most younger kids that go there are always with an adult. So the parent can keep an eye on there kid if she doesnt believe its right for them to read the offensive books. Parents should not let there kid go to the library without them if they are scared for them to do something or look at something bad.      Talking at libraries is always fun because you can talk about the book your reading or just hangout. The staff and people there get so mad if kids are laughing or talking about something. I think they should make a floor people can go to, to hangout and talk.      In libraries there are a lot of good things to do rather bad things people always feel welcome there. Books that people say are offensive are usually the interesting ones. So if you do not want to see or your kids to see the offensive books and movies you should make sure not to go in the adult section.",2,3,2,0
3480,2,"Is it understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age?  No it is not the whole situation of wether or not libraries should have things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to certain people due to there age should not be an issue.  My reasoning on that is not because of how it @MONTH1 influence people in a bad way.  Then again it @MONTH1 influence them in a fantastic way.          Thats how people find out who they are such as, what their interested in, what they like, and what they want to do.  If it wasnt for establishments such as libraries most people would be the same as the others and not have a sense of character to themselves. People would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others.  People should be aware of some of the content in books. Just not to the point were those areas become restricted to certain age groups.  Movies and cds are more understandable do to the actual graphic violence and language that some musicans and actors @MONTH1 use.  Except in a book its not what other people are doing and saying its what you yourself is reading and how you yourself is interperating it.  It takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what your reading and how your reading it.     Thats why the whole situation of wether or not libraries certain things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to a certain age group, but instead having the ares labeled on what the category is to know before looking.  So therefor that is my views and beleifs on why or why not libraries should be restricted to certain people.",3,3,3,1
3484,2,"I think that people who find them offensive just need to stay away from them type of books, music, movies and magazines. Some of the books people need to know about. Take the consentration camps for instince, people need to learn about them so we can prevent that horrible event from happining again.     I think that by letting people read those types of books it help us understand and learn what happened in the passed. So we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger. They can be in danger by someone being like @PERSON1 and killing millions of jews just because they look diferent. Also like slavery just because they are a different color doesnt mean they are not human. So keeping them in shelves could help our future.     Also if you are disturbed by music or movies then simply dont listen/watch them but let other people who is interested in them learn. My mom thinks that bloody-scarry movies shouldn't be allowed to sell in stores but i told her that thats what some people like watching and that people need to watch some of them to try to not let anything like them happen ever.     In conclution, we should keep some of these bad books, music, movies and magazines on the shelves so we will fight to keep horible historical events form happining again",3,4,3,1
3486,2,I believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item. I have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else. If you dont like that the library displays all the 'OFFENSIVE' items then you dont have to go it is an personal choice. Everyone has their own choice on what they listion to or read it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing. That is what I believe in,1,1,1,0
3490,2,"The material that someone people believe shouln't be viewed by childern, I don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason.     The library is not just for the children but also for the adults. Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while their out in public. So why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them? I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves. By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library.     Another reason i don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them. Their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read. Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things. If everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library. Their only custmors left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being.     There are always ways to make both side of the situatation fair. I just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do.",4,4,4,2
3492,2,"In this life time we will all have our own oppinions about topics and problems in the world. There is a question that ponders in my mind. Is censorship in libraries a problem or a right? If i was a parent, I think I would be able to understand why I mite want to have a book removed from a shelf, but the thing is though, it is unconstitutional to do that. That is why in my oppinion censorship in libraries should not be aloud.      When I was twelve, one time at the library I was reading the back of a book, and my mom approached me and told me that book was a little too graphic for me to be reading. It was about the @CAPS1. Now that I am older, I realize why my mom wouldn't want me to be reading a book like that at that age. That is one reason I can understand why some one would want to have a book removed from a shelf, but they can not do that because, that book is there to remind us why we should never have another world war again. I also think that everyone has there right of an oppinion on why somthing should be, or not should be done.     One thing that I have obserbed, is that when kids read bad things, and look at bad things, it can really have a big impact on there life as what they do in the future, and there present. That reason it's self is a very good explanation on why I think that instead of censoring books, there should be some type of boundaries posted on what types of books should be read beyond a certain age, or if the child wants to read a certain type of book, the child must have a legal gurdian with them at that time.     With that being said, I have come up with, what I believe to be a very good idea on what should be done in libraries. I think that any book that mite have somthing that is a little bit appropriate should be put into a section that is rated just like movies. If somthing has a little bit of inappropriate language such as cursing, these books should be put in a section for people over the age of thirteen just like a movie. Basically, the books will be put into sections depending on what they are rated just like a movie. If the book is rated @CAPS2, you must be over the age of seventeen to read it.     This idea could be a really good solution, that way no books would be removed, but also these books will be kept out of harms way of children. Honestly, if I was a parent I would not want my children to indulge in reading of books that talk about sex, violence, and vulger, but also it is my belief that we all have our own oppinion, and have the right to be able to read and see what we want.      On thing I think we all need to think about is things that have been done in the past that have had huge benifits on our country. Our four fathers, more than one hundred years ago wrote a document called the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1. This document has amendments. These amendments state that we have the right to speak, have oppinions, and read what we want because, we should have the right to live a free life.               To remove books from the shelves is unconstitutional, and I don't know about you,  but I know that all the people that have gone against the constituotion have not found a great place in this world. My basic belief is that, why remove a book from a shelf, when we can impervise so everyone is happy? If the world would just get over the harsh things of the books we can all come up with a solution. There is an answer for this, books should not be burned they are master pieces. Cencorship can not continue in libraries or there won't be any books left.",4,5,4,2
3494,2,"NO, I think books and ect. should be tooking down off selves if they are offensive! It's a free country and they have they will to freedom of speech. No one can think for nobody so everybody's going to have their opioin.

If we took down the books people said offened them we would'nt have any books left. Everyone has their own opioin about things and diffrent views. It's most likely that someones goin to get offened. In some cases it makes a person better at wat their doing to be offened. Some offensive things are part of @CAPS1 and shows how things progressed from back then to now. What's a child without it's @CAPS1?             Out of all the people who should be mad or think they should be offened is the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ,but their not complaining about the books and etc. then no one should. You know jus as well as I know that most of the movies are about how we got whipped and sold back in slavery.Books about how only a couple of us made it. Magazines about how we sex and kill each other. Papper telling how are black communties are failing.                So in my opioin, no books should be tooken of the shelfs if there found offenisve. It was going on before we got here and when we leave it's still going to be going on. It's apart of @CAPS1 and there's no better way to find out about things if you don't see it yourself. People always saying kids should read more. What's to read if you take all the books down thats offensive?",2,3,2,0
3495,2,"I believe that certain books, movies, music, and magazines should be taken off the shelves, to those who they are offending. I myself have not come across any books, movies, or music that have offended me. I believe that we should organize our books, movies, and music in a different way perhaps.     First of all, people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up, and do something about it. Finding a way to reach a happy medium. If everyone could take a certain movie or book off of the shelf there wouldn't be any left in my opinion. If people find it offending they should stay away from those certain types books or movies.     Secondly, there are people like me who are not offended at all from these books, music, and movies. Its not fair for the ones like me to not be able to read, listen, or watch what we want to. If someone doesn't like the movie we loved, and they take it away it's not fair and buisnesses will lose customers.     Lastly, to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me. I believe we could organize our books, movies, music, and magazines in a different way. Instead of organizing by author they should be organized by age restrictions. Just like rated @CAPS1 movies, or rated @CAPS2 video games. Books and music can be organized in this fassion also. It would be easier for people who are offended to stay away from the ones they don't want to be around.     In conclusion, I believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book, movie, or @CAPS3 off of a shelf is not very smart. One, its not fair for people who are not offended. Two, buisnesses will lose customers. Three, there is a better way to solve this problem",4,4,4,2
3498,2,"In a library it's censorship should be conrtolled by the people that go to that library. If it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf. The libraries should not take books off the shelf due to the beliefs of one person, no the libraries should take all the books and give them a rateing once they have that only the reader should decide if the book, music, movies, magazines, etc, are offensive to them.     Of course there are some books that adults @MONTH1 not wish their child to read and then they should talk to the librarian and set a boundry of what rateing of book their child can check out. Organizing the books this way anbody can read anything they want to though there are the books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf, they need to stop a minute and realize that one of the books they like someone else might not want on the shelf.     In the end the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books. so to prevent a power struggle this way a comittee should be set up to decide what books to purchase. you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book, but those people will just have to deal with it.     The books on the libraries banned book list should be in the libray also, the books are just books weather you read them or not is your choice. The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the schools money purchasing the books the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library.     In short my veiw of book censorship is that, the library will choose the books that go into the library. To make things easier the books should have a rateing system that would be the national standard for all public libraries. Like I stated previously the books are just books its your choice to read them",4,4,4,2
3500,2,"I don't think they should take down any book because they were donated to us in the first place.Also,I dont think they should take them down because it helps us learn about what other people went through in there lifetime.Look at it and try to live life as you would in another persons shoes.Try to see where they come from and there life style.Im not as big reader or anything but wants I get that one book that just catches my eye and sounds good to read I look at it and if it is good I would take it and read for a long time because I want to know what happens next in the book.So I keep reading and reading and like in the middle of the story my teacher makes me stop reading.I would read as long as it takes but it just has to be the right book for me.I like all kinds of books from sports to sad emotional books.I like reading out loud to myself it helps me understand a little bit better.",2,2,2,0
3502,2,"Movies, books, music, magazines, and more all have there own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about. If the author choses to write something that you do not nessisarly agree with or is offensive to you then do not read or watch that piece of material.     Everyone is intitled to there own opions. Theycan do and say what they want. Somethings those opions @MONTH1 have consequences involved but you still can write the material you want. As an author you provide a book to the public, If it gets that far. When a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like. I book should not be taking off the shelf is someone finds that offensive. Someone else @MONTH1 not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material. When a movie is made and it is '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or is offensive to someone then people just do not go and see that movie. They do not stop playing it because someone @MONTH1 having different feelings about the movie.     If you find a movie, magazine, or even a book offensive then do not read it or do not watch it. Someome else @MONTH1 enjoy something that you do not. Not everyone in the world today is going to agree on whats offensive and whats not. You can not always make everyone happy. If the book becomes a problem and it a majority amount of people that think it is offensive then yes maybe it should be talked about taking off of the shelf. If you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it. If someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material then they also have the right to do that. If something is offensive it is a personal choice to think so, so why take if off the shelf when they just do not have read it?",3,3,3,1
3507,2,"How can writing be offensive? Many @CAPS1 find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive. Yet others find that those things make their writing more interesting. Writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts. It seems like in today's writing you can pick up just about anything and somone will find it offensive. That means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left. It is just like Katherine Paterson says in the quote, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS1 can't deny that books and any other writing place ideas in our head. That idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out. I believe we have a choice to either except or deny those offensive ideas in our head. If we find something offensive, simply set the book down and use that better judgemnt. We know what is right therefore we decide what is ok to read. Everyone sees things differently.     What about children, can we trust their better judgement? I fear that children don't have as great of judgement as more mature adults. The resposibility of judgement lies more on the parents of that child than the libraries. The libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age. Both the adults and children get to find books that fit them and don't offend them.      If libraries did do censorchip it would deny us our rights and freedom to speek our minds clearly without a haze being placed to confuse it. We as a country were built off the radical and offensive things written about the @CAPS2. Those words are what fired us up to become an independent country. Just think if they would have censored those ideas. Would we still be @LOCATION1 today? What it all comes down to is not that we should censore our reading but that we should use our better judgement.",4,4,4,2
3519,2,"Some books are offensive to some people. But eveyrone has the right to read any book they want. I believe we shouldnt censor books that are found offensive in schools. If people find offensive from the beggining, find another book to read or talk to the teacher.           I have had my experience with books who are offensive to me. Everyone has a book they have read that does that to them. But that same book i have read might be interesting to other people. Whatever doesnt @CAPS1 you makes you stronger, right? So don't take a book in a hurtful way. Books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain people.      I had poeple come up to me from our own school saying the books they read were a horrible experience. Specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad. I told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her. Thats all you have to do and not make anything big about it.      I also read the book, 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2', which is censored in some states because its hurtful to some people. The story is about a white family trying to help an @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man who was accused of raped when he never commited such thing. That was not acceptable at the time and with all the evidence in the world they still couldn't help him. Its a great story about what black poeple went through in earlier years. And to think they would censor a story about a white lawyer trying to help someone who isn't his own race is inspiring to me, not offensive.      He got harrased and his children got harrased but he still fought with all he had to save his deffendant. I am a @NUM1 year old boy who when he read this book knowing who had a heart and who didnt made me cry my eyes out. It's sad to know this book is censored in some states when this is defenitely one of the best books i have ever read and also the only one that got to me. It would be a great experience for anybody to read this book so even if it is censored where you live, go buy it and read it anyway.      I feel the state assumes they are gonna offend people. They might not even test it anyways. They might just say its gonna offend this kinda people and thats it. How do they cokme up with it? Do they let everybody read it once? No, and they should just leave it whoever doesn't read it doesnt have to or they can talk with their teacher. Its not so hard to decide to censor something when its only your opinion. Thats why i would look into the opinion of others.     All in all censorship shouldn't be allowed. It ruins the oppurtonity for people to read books they might find good and interesting to them. Let the kids read atleast in highschool when they are all almost adults so they can read whatever they want",4,4,4,2
3520,2,"Censorship being as touchy a subject it is in my belief should be very rarely upheld, yes I believe there should be exceptions such as censoring materials in a childrens library or a childrens section of a bigger library, but to censor is to take ones freedom of speech, and expression away from them and is by my standards nothing more than unamerican.     Censorship acceptions should definetley be held in certain circumstances such as on a children's television network or a school library. Growing up my parents have not set any regulations for me regarding censorship, ever since I can remember I have been able to watch, read, and listen to anything I have ever wanted so my opinion is obviously going to slide toward uncensorship right? Wrong, although I do believe that nothing should be censored from the general public except for in special cases, I believe that it is the parents choice and full responsibility regarding their childrens censorship needs. I myself when I am a parent are going to censor my children away from what I seem unfit for their age whatever it @MONTH1 be.     The main reason that I am writing is to explain the moral issue that censorship is offering, yes the reason we consor is because we believe that the material is offensive or has ill moral, but these are the opinions and beliefs of the creators and being in a society that claims to be tolerant of one's beliefs we should respect the creator's beliefs even though it is not the belief of ourselves. To censor is to force an artist or in essence a creator to change they're very reflections of themselves, after all that is what a work of art is whether it be a painting, a musical piece, or a television show it shows a distinct look into the creators mind and beliefs to censor is to cut off or warp this communication between the audience and the creator thus violating the freedom of speech, and freedom of expression that our country holds so dear.     I call this a touchy subject because when there is childrens welfare involved it is always a touchy subject, to prevent children from being exposed to what their parents seem inapropriate I believe that we should retain a censorship in such places as childrens library or childrens television networks, but as a country we are putting too much responsibility and reliability on the hope that the government will censor what we seem unfit when in reality it should be the job and choice of the parents to censor what their children are exposed to. to solve this growing debate I believe the solution lies in the question, 'should we censor material' well yes and no I generally think that for every book, song, or creation that some seem unfit for society should be released as censored and uncensored, this would open up oppurtunities for children to read more advanced literature, will not take away from the personel expression of the creators, and will not deny the public what they are looking for because a censored material is a loss for the creator as well as the audience who enjoy it",4,3,4,2
3522,2,"People have different opinions what one @MONTH1 find extremely offensive another @MONTH1 not care or even laugh at it. In this next paragraph I will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries.      One of the first things is our freedom of speech. If we really have that freedom the censorship violates it completely. Some people are offensive but you must remember they are entitled to their opinion. They have a right to speak for what they belive in. Whether it be magazines, books, newspapers, movies, or music. The author or artist @MONTH1 use those to spread his/her ideas and beliefs. Another reason is people's opinions. Does one person really speak for an entire gender,country, culture, race, religion? Whether he/she is the lowest of the low or a person of great power, someone @MONTH1 believe different and miss out on something maybe they would have been inspired by or learned from. It is not right to deprive communication through these things. A man @MONTH1 find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him @MONTH1 find the book funny and joke about it. People think differently from each other. Personal experiences are also have a place. Maybe a near death experience causes someone to write a book. Maybe a bad break up causes someone to make a song. These help inspire people. No person can tell them it's wrong just because they thinks it's offensive or wrong.     All this things factor in. No one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom. I am against censorship in libraries and I hope you are too.",3,3,3,1
3524,2,"Who is to label a book offensive? What one might find appauling, others @MONTH1 find a novel or passage to be rather interesting. All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests.          Books such as The @CAPS1, The @CAPS2's @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been removed from many library shelves. Though people @MONTH1 check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books. I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot. If books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education.      Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? Any book could be offensive to any one person. Any article, song, or film could be offensive. But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. Censorship in libraries has gone on too long, it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them.               The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories. First by subject, down to the author. Therefore, books that @MONTH1 be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them.      Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day. People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it. All books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow. Growth is not meant to be limited, nor is freedom.",4,4,4,2
3525,2,"People have a choice on the types of literature they want to read wether it offends them or not the chose to read it. Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries.They need to try to avoid the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to them. Now if they cant then thats not the libraries fault. Books should not be removed for many reasons.     One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because they know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making and sometimes decisions have consequences. When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offened them so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books.     Another reason would be the libraries dont know what offends people it can be one little thing in a book but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelfs. Also just cause one person tihnks its offensive doesn't mean that others will. People arn't all offended by the same thing some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily, some arn't offended so easy, that means it make take more serious things than a book to offend a person.     Another reason books shouldnt be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments. Some school assignments require you getting a little offended exspecially if your african american and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time. But we need to learn about past experiences and our history and we couldnt do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf. You @MONTH1 get offended but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at sometime.Find another way to solve that problem.     There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone. There is no need to completly remove the book. Another solution would be to maybe seperate the books, meaning put the books in a diffrent location of the library if the get more than a couple complaints of being offensive. Also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it @MONTH1 offend them. Thats why removing books from shelves arn't cause for.",3,3,3,1
3527,2,"There are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading. Books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a book I had read and it was very out there and straight forward. But I would have to disagree I think those books deserve to be read. It shows kids that not everything is perfect.      People complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @CAPS3 or in music is bad but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it. If parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up. But I do have to agree with one thing, there are alot of bad things in muic and magazines but I think it can be avoided and not be caused to crupt a kid. I'm very into music and some music I dont listen to because of the things in it but I dont let that music or magazines change my option on things. I dont think people should be able to take books of the shelfs becaue it doesnt give other students or people to read them. Some people get inspired by books about drugs, not like to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome stitutions just like them. I like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live. If people can get offended off of a book or movie I don't think they have a right to take that away. I think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them, because everyone has an option and not everyone thinks the same things.      With all the bad or good movies or books out there, I'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies but that isn't a reason to want to take it down. Because once you do that someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive and it will make you mad. I think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always wanting to start a fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies",4,4,4,2
3529,2,"There are millions of books and other media in libraries all across the world. Millions of people read and listen to those materials every day. Some people @MONTH1 like certain books or media and dislike others. Many people dislike certain materials because of their content. Everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials. Although some materials @MONTH1 be offensive, they should not be removed from the libraries.     Books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions. If someone wants to read a book or watch a video, they should be able to. What is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that person's point of view. If someone thinks the content in a book, song, or movie is offensive, then they should not read or listen to it.     Materials should not be removed from libraries because they can be used to learn history and other things that people should know about. Take, for example, the @CAPS1. There are thousands of books on the @CAPS1 and many movies as well. These materials should not be removed from library shelves because even though some people find them offensive, they can be used to teach people how horrible it was so that it does not happen again. People should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside. Some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences.     The offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there. Most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences. There are not children's books that talk about things that parents would find offensive to their children. The content has a right to be there. If the author or publisher took the the time to create the work, then they should recieve credit for making it. In the @LOCATION1, there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say. If the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances.     The content in libraries, offensive or not, should not be removed. People can read or watch whatever they want. Many people have many different opinions on what should and should not be in libraries. The libraries are public and they are shared. No one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries. If it was not for libraries, the people in society would not be as smart as they are",4,4,4,2
3531,2,"One @MONTH1 walk into a library, look over at a magzine rack and think, '@CAPS1 is that in the young adult section, the content of that book is not age appropriate?' In many libraries, some books are not censored and catagorized the way they should. In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it. Supervision of children and young adults are not always looked upon, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out. Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries.      In most libraries, the catagories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genere, magazines, and music, but what needs looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books. Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age appropriate. I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color weel. Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcholism, drugs, sex, same sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back on it, I am surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library. A fourteen year old didn't need to read books on such heavy topics.Also, language in books and music maybe unappropriate for children, and @MONTH1 be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults. The catagories need to be catogorized even more, so people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine.      When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn't even pay attention to the book they are getting, they simply check it out. Libraries should have a rating system like movies do. Generally people would not let their ten-year-old go to a movie rated @NUM1, @CAPS2 or that is unrated, so @CAPS1 would they let their child get a book holding the same content? If books had a rating system, that ten-year- old would not get their hands on a book rated '@CAPS2' or '@CAPS4' for mature.     In libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be. I am aware that libraries are not day-care center and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines, because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading. For example, a thirteen-year-old girl wants to check out @CAPS5 magazine, because her best friend's older sister gets it. The girl's mother allows it because it probably won't be too bad and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends. What the mother @MONTH1 not realize is in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that @MONTH1 open a whole new world for the little girl. Even though the mother shouldn't have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library the girl might have never have read that article. Even if librarians had to check or scan a person's library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people then it would be hurting.     If libraries censored books better, then children and teens @MONTH1 not be reading things not age appropriate to them. I'@CAPS4 not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher, and be watched over more carefully",4,3,4,2
3532,2,"This essay is to describe my opinion on if certain materials that can be offensive, should be removed from shelves in libraries. I think that overall, anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries.     I think that if they are very offensive, then they should be taken out; but if they are just mildly offensive, then i think they should stay. Because the library welcomes people of all ages, materials that can be taken offensive for children are most of the time not taken as offensive to adults. But since children go in there and can have access to anything in there, they can end up finding something that can be offensive.     If a child finds something that their parents can be taken as offensive, then the library could possibly get sued and that would not be good. So if they just take any books, music, magazines, or movies that are not suitable for people of all ages, they can cut the risk of being sued.     Libraries are meant to provide information anyways. They have no need for things that are offensive, because rarely something that is offensive, provides information. Libraries should just contain what they were made for: encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, and other books that can provide useful information to people.     In conclusion I would say that materials that can be offensive to anyone of any age, should be taken out of libraries. Libraries are meant to provide information to people so I think thats all that they should have",3,3,3,1
3535,2,"Censorship in libraries is an inportant thing in schools and in the public. It is inportant beause some of movies, books, and magizines have a bigger influince on the kids then most people think. Like some of the really gory movies the are always people in the movie gettin cut up or shoot. Do you really think that some kids dont think about hat stuff. Somtimes the kids can get it in there head that they can do what they see or read.     Like in the movie @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 they are beating up and killing people just because they are colored. And some kids @MONTH1 think that that is ok. And they can go down to there librarie and just get it off the shelf and check it out and go home and watch it. Now if you r using it as a thing to teach kid that it was the way things use to be and that it is wrong then that is ok. You can teach your kids all you want just make sure that it is the wright thing.     And some magazines that are in the schools or in the public librarie are just not the kind of thing that kids should not be looking at. Like the gun magazines or the hunting magazines the just show that it is ok to carie a gun were ever they go. And the hunting magazines just show that you can go out and shoot stuff. And some kids @MONTH1 be confused that you need a lisense to do all of that. You have to at least put and age limmiet of some stuff.     Go's the sameway with some of the books they always start out good and then the just turn into a big mess of gor and vileance. Like the spere it started out with a group of people going under water to explore a ship. And they find a big shpere and they go in it and get these powers and they imagin it and it comes true. Well when a kid reads that they @MONTH1 think that they can do that and they start imaging that they can eather hurt or really do some damage to someone. And then when they find out that it wont work they @MONTH1 do it to them themselves.     So it just come to show that you should censor some of the stuff that you have in your libraries and if you can take them out then at least put and age limite on them",3,3,3,1
3537,2,"Censorship in Libraries               Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 are many books, magazines, and movies out @CAPS1 that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children. Part of a parent's job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level. However, this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone. Censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose. Also, content that is inappropriate for children @MONTH1 be fine for adults to read. It is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf.      All people of @LOCATION2 have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free. People have the freedom to choose, whether it is books, magazines, movies, or music. Everyone is different and this causes the interests of each person to be different, also. Libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests. Censoring the content on the shelves of libraries @MONTH1 be a good idea for children, however adults have the right to choose what they want to take from the shelf. Would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away? Censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality.     Furthermore, censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons. @CAPS1 is content out @CAPS1 that children should not see; however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with. Although certain materials are not meant for children to see, adults @MONTH1 find it enjoyable and interesting. Libraries offer a large range of materials and this allows people to express themselves and find entertainment. @CAPS1 are many different types of books and music out @CAPS1 and censoring these would greatly limit the variety.      In addition, parents have the responsibility to watch over their children. They choose what @CAPS1 child wears, where they live, and where they attend school. It is no different when it comes to books, movies, and music. Each parent has a different style of parenting and they choose what works best for their child. If one parent finds something to be offensive or inappropriate, they shelter their children from it. However, another parent @MONTH1 not have a problem with it. The content children choose from library shelves should be at the discretion of the parent. Afterall, you cannot shelter children from everything.      Censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions. It rids patrons of their right to choose and their freedom. Censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from. It is not the responsibility of the law to choose what children can and cannot read, but rather the parent's job to watch over what they take off the shelf. As citizens of the @LOCATION1, we have rights and freedom allowing us to act as indivuals. Censoring the materials on library shelves results in very little materials left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books life on the shelf for any of us.",4,4,4,2
3539,2,"Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work i abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries. Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content. From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries.     The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues. Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one. It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else? From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period. Since I went to a @CAPS1 school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books. As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books. If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world. Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population.     Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose. It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate. The concept is quite simple; if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand. Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it. Censorship is wrong for this very reason. The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to. The audience they are trying to appeal to @MONTH1 not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter. Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person @MONTH1 enjoy thouroughly. Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person. As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in. So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others.     In a great deal of different types of literature censorship is touched on by the authors. For example, in the popular prize-winning novel, @CAPS2 @NUM1, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time. However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone. Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human-kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one. Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves. Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain.     As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people @MONTH1 never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines. From my own past experiences on this situation I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature. People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries. If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it. Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished. Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves",4,4,4,2
3543,2,"In Katherine Paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive. But I think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye, but are still there for those certin people.     If my child were to pick up a book that was not for his/or her age group I would not get made, because I know that some of the book groups are close to others them some, but they are for everyone to see, which could be offensive to some. I would tell my son/ or daughter that that book is not for you, and we would go and pick out a new book to read.     Over all I think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certin age group, and should not be seen by kids. Because once I was that little kid, and went wondering through the miles of shelfs to find a really wonderful book to read, but long behold that didn't happen, I had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group.     So I think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again.",3,3,3,1
3544,2,"There are some movies,books,music,etc that @MONTH1 be found  offensive toward some people.I feel that if you are at the          appropriate age for a type of literature you should be able to observe it.If you read a book and you find it offensive,then      you shouldn't have read the book.Books,music,and movies are made to entertain you,however,if you are not entertained then what you're reading or watching is not for you!  I have had an experience in which I was offended by a movie I watched.It degraded women in which they were beaten and were treated as slaves.I was offended because as I watched the movie,and I realized that these women were someone's daughter and mother.I wouldn't agree with my mother being treated that way,also I wouldn't want any other woman being treated that way either.After I watched the movie,I went and informed my mother on how that movie offended me.I am sure that the authors who write the books intentions aren't to offend the reader,however,there @MONTH1 be a way that they can restate things that they say.I know that people have their own opinion,and that people think differently.If it is obvious that the reader's intentions are to offend the reader then you shouldn't purchase a book like that.If you find a book on the shelf,and you find it offensive,it shouldn't have to be removed from the shelf.Another person @MONTH1 read the book ,and they might like it.Everyone has their own way of thinking,and how they absorb information.It @MONTH1 be offensive to the reader,but someone else @MONTH1 recieve the book and admire it.  In conclusion,I feel that if you are offended by a certain book,type of music,or movie you should learn from the movie,and explain why it offended you.If a parent is offended they shouldn't allow their children to observe it as well.It will have a negative effect on your child.Books,music,movie,etc are made to entertain,not to offend.",4,4,4,2
3547,2,"To who @CAPS3 @MONTH1 consern,         I belive that books,movies, and magazines should not beremoved from the shelfs of a library if they are found offensive. @CAPS2 books @MONTH1 seem offinsive to @CAPS2 people but to others there prospective is a lot different. I belive that if books or other things are found offinseive they should have  a speacial place for them, to where mature people will be able to read them. Books are very valuable to most people in the united states.      Many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive. But is @CAPS3  really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write. Just because one person  reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like they call @CAPS3 offensive. I have a feeling that alot more people would feel the same way.      Along with movies,and etc. I feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library. There are kids sections, @CAPS1 sections, And even a teenage section. I feel like parents now in days dont want thier children to learn about stuff early in life. But i still feel like if they did not want there kids reading @CAPS3 then dont let them.     If there ever was a need to really look at something and give @CAPS3 another chance this  would be the topic right here. Libraries all over the world are all neat and organized. So why could they not make a section just for books, movies, magazines that people find offinsive. Sure @CAPS3 might take a little bit more work but hey, @CAPS2 one has to do @CAPS3.      As you can see these are really good reason why they should not remove stuff that other people find offinsive  from  libraries. I mean half of the stuff they find any way are based on true stories or they are biographys. People really do enjoy alot of these books and even movies,or magazines. @CAPS3 would be really great if this could happen, @CAPS3 would make a lot of people happy and satisfide.",4,4,4,2
3549,2,"Libraries hold many books and movies such as fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure.  These books have many different styles and portrails and many of these @MONTH1 be takeno offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf.     One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'.  This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them @ORGANIZATION1 offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country. Why, because it was written back when slavery was legl and slaves were treated as property not people.    A movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog @CAPS4.  This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be a @CAPS4?'.  Many indians @CAPS2 are smarter could be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart.  But, people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real.       But if you go to somepeople and ask them about these books are movies some will say they are @ORGANIZATION1 good others might be offended so they might as weel stay on the shelfs.  The book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' is a book about the civil war could this be scene as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelfs.     So books in libraries shouldn't be censroed because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group; they should stay on the shelf because every books other tahn some childrens books have something offensive.  Thus if we took books off the shelfs for being offensive their would be nothing to read except for 'The @ORGANIZATION1'!",4,4,4,2
3550,2,"Would you ever read a book about the @CAPS1 times if your @CAPS2? Are you going to read about how people of your religion and maybe even your family were tortured? Probably not. If your a colored man/woman, are you going to engage in a book that talks about slavery? Not likely. How about if you are a mother, are you going to want to read a novel or magazine about abortion? Are you going to let your child read that book? Of course not! So you are probably wondering why they are even on the shelves, right? Its on the shelves for basically one reason, to drownd us in the knowledge it holds.     Whether we are learning about criminals, racism, or wars, there is always going to be one person who is against it all. When we read, we find books that are to our own enjoyment, we look for books that can spark ideas and images in our heads. Most of us however, don't quite understand why others refuse to read such a book or even hold in their hands a book that is different from all their beliefs. Beliefs are important to people no matter their age, gender, sexuality, or their race. Its just a way of life.     Some stories are there for our entertainment, some catch our emotions, and some our there for our knowledge. When authors write, they usually think of events that have happend or what they predict could happen in the future. Authors try to get you to understand the world around you, not by trying to offend you in anyway. Books tend to affect people in many ways, possitive and yes, sometimes negative. Its something they can't really control though, so you can't really blame anyone for you being offended.     I don't agree that libraries shouldn't have these books on their shelves, I think they are good for us. No, i don't mean we should go around eating books. We should take time to read some of those so called offensive books. You are probably thinking, there is no way I'm going to pick up that type of book and sit down and read it. However, let me tell you that if we read these books, the more people will understand about how terrible times were back then and how some things are still bad. Take abortion into perspective. Books about abortion give us an idea about how horrible it is or how it can not only effect the women who go through with it. It appeals to the emotions of others in a way that makes them think twice about lifes decisions.     Books should be kept on the shelves for our own well-being. When it comes down to the choice, you will know just what to do. You know how useful books are in helping us see the differece between right and wrong. You understand why books are placed on shelves for in the first place, no its not for the money. I know that you are going to understand what I'm trying to tell you. Now head on over to your library and pick up a book about something you would like to no more about. Who knows, maybe you will get a book that makes you think twice about what information is held in between the bindings",4,4,4,2
3557,2,"What do I think about library censorship? I believe that there should be some censorship, but not too much censorship. Each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest.     Certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries. There are stores that could provide you with that material for you to purchase. Most parents wouldn't like their child to be exposed to these certain materials, so they believe that the libraries shouldn't provide these types of materials.     Now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content. They are strong, but not too strong to not be put in libraries. Some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure.     Just because someone doesn't enjoy this material that the library has provided, doesn't mean that the material should be taken away. If that was how things worked there would be nothing in the library for people to enjoy. Every person has their own taste in materials, be it more mature materials or a little more 'tame' materials. Everyone is inclined to their opinions, but their opinion doesn't decide what is and isn't in their library.     I myself enjoy a wide choice of materials from libraries. Some strong materials, some more 'tame' materials. It all depends on the persons own interests and choices. Sometimes I @MONTH1 be disapointed when I'm looking for something in a library and it's not there, because to some people it's too strong but to me and others it's just a good source of harmless entertainment.     In conclusion I think that there should be some censorship in libraries, but not too much censorship that people can't find things that interest them. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and has their own form of entertainment, but their libraries shouldn't be built on an indivdual's opinions.",3,4,3,1
3560,2,"Do I think offensive reading materials should be taken off the shelves in libraries? No, books should not be taken out of libraries. If students go to school and they are in high school they pretty much already know what is going on around the world. Teens do talk about their lives so pretty much @CAPS1. High and @CAPS2 students are going to hear. If the parents are sending their child to school and they don't want them to hear about it then don't send them to school! In school they will hear verbal arguments and see fights. If the parents don't want them to hear about it from other kids than they tell them, they explain it to them. One way or another they will find out. It can come from the parents, their friends, teachers anybody. Teens do not care if your child is watching when they are fighting; they are not worried about that at that time.     The saying 'one person ruins it all for everybody,' well thats because some teens need to grow up and act their age. If you can't act your age than you shouldn't be in the grade you are in. Kids and teens need to grow up if they can't read a book without being inmature about it than don't read it. If their parents let them watch movies that they think they are old enough to watch than don't take advantage of that.          Taking books out of the libraries will not change anything. Kids will still fight and rough house. Yeah some books are a little outragous, but not all books. To be honest libraries should have sections of books depending on the age or grade they are in. High schoolers should be able to control reading about sex, drugs, or drinking. If they are not responsible to read that than they shouldn't get that book anyway. Songs made today can get a little out of hand. If your child listens to that kind of music with all the bad words, talking about sex, drugs, alchol. Than parents all you got to do is take those songs away. Teens that are mature shouldn't get punished just because inmature can't watch a movie, listen to sond, read a book or a magazine. It's not fair to those people. People that act their age should be able to read, watch the movie, or anything just because they can handle the situation better. So don't punish everybody just because of some inmature kids that ruin it for everybody",3,3,3,1
3566,2,"Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the libary? Well,in my point of view I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc.. are amazing, exciting and fun to read or watch they should not be removed from the shelves in the local libary. For a fact people in general have many types of tastes in books thier's drama, romance, action and many other that also apply to movies, magazines and etc. The public should not be punished for one's intreast in themes, and how they take the book. Thier should be an age limit in witch kids can't read certain books and those of age should read whatever they please.          I, myself  like to read scary books, they give me chills and all types of questions runing through my brain. Someone else from my community could have the same trait of thought I have when reading a scary book. Without books that don't fit are personality thier would be less people in libaries reading and more people trying to keep themseleves occupied and half of them might even get bored and start commiting crimes, to keep there self  occupied. People in the community have rights to read, hear or watch witch ever type of material they like.      If people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display, they should not even pick it up to begin with. They should look for stuff they would enjoy, not just because the book is about 'violence' or just simply don't like the theme they, should not hold it against other people that might enjoy it. Books and other material were meant for us to enjoy them and from the authors or directores choice to share with us thier stories. Without books like those many people can't get ideas to help them creat thier own book or novel.      So that is my view on the situation, people should enjoy whatever material they like. But, if you are one of those people that think books, movies, magazienes should be removed, take a day and read a book or see a movie from your local libary and see how it will change your mind",4,4,4,2
3567,2,"There are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library. You can find things on cars, trucks, sports, and made up stories for fun. There are some materials in a library though that could be offensive. But should those materials be removed from the library? Some think that they should and others think that they shouldn't be.     In my opinion I don't think that things should be removed from a library. Certain people @MONTH1 find things offensive and others @MONTH1 think it is perfectly fine to have in a library. I think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in  library.     I think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material. People don't want a little child to read something that is meant to be for an adult. That would teach kids bad things that they don't need to be reading about. I think that there should be an area set for kids that are in elementary to high school and there should be a section that is for adults. That way kids aren't reading things that are meant for adults.     I also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about. Like if there are books on slavery they should have an area for books that are about that that way people who are offended be it know to stay away from it. The same with magazines. i don't think they should be removed from a library if they are found offensive to some people because other people @MONTH1 enjoy reading them.     Some reading material @MONTH1 be found offensive to certain people but to othersit @MONTH1 not be. I think things shouldn't be removed from libraries. There are some things that people @MONTH1 need have in a library if they are doing a project that way they have the resources to do it.     I do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are aloud in the store. kids don't nedd to be watching adult movies while they are in elementary school. That just isn't right. Espaecially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be doing.     So in my opinion there are some things that should and should not be removed from a library. Music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing. Magazines and other things should be kept away to where only adults could get to them",4,4,4,2
3568,2,"I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended, they are obviously paranoid. If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then don't allow them to get it. Don't make all of the other people suffer. Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem. You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'      @CAPS1 of all, people have a variety of opinions. Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok. If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think? They @MONTH1 find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book. Then it would create a big conflict.     Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature. They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong. If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover it when they're older? As a child, it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong. Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults.     Censorship is the same thing that @PERSON1 did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society. In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in @CAPS2 society. The citizens of @LOCATION1 have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong. It's one of the ideals that help make this country great",5,5,5,3
3569,2,"Censorship. Sometimes it's needed, sometimes it's not. Children of today are exposed to many adult things, whether it is watching tv or a movie, or just witnessing things at home. I believe censorship is neccesary for young children, they shouldn't be exposed to bad launguage, or graphic scenes, or something that is strictly for adults. They will experience these things one day, and they need to be mature enough to understand them. Teenagers on the other hand is a whole different story. They want to hear the bad language and see graphic, gory scenes. It's all about action to the boys, drama for the girls, and everyone wants to hear those juicy details. Censorship won't stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these things in them. Even though all teens act like it's not important and that their old enough to see all this, somethimes their probably not. If you think that telling your teenage daughter or son that their not allowed to watch a movie or read a book because of something it says, they'll probably just go log onto the internet and see it anyway. Nothing is censored on the internet, so if your all about censorship, don't go onto to the internet.Adults do not need censorship. There adults, they can make their own decisions and they know what they want to watch or read.Removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes needed. There should be sections, children, teens, and adults. There are ratings on movies, and books are written for a certain age limit so everything should be placed accordingly. Censorship is needed, but your parents or guardian are the ones who will most likely tell you whether or not your going to be able to read a book or a watch a movie. Some people find things more offensive than others. So censorship is really in the eye of the beholder. Personally I believe in censorship, but to others, its a waste of time. I wouldn't want my child watching a movie where someone gets brudally murdered and where there cussing every other word. Music can come uncensored and censored, it just depends what you want to hear. Censorship is either loved or hated, its all one big opinion.",3,3,3,1
3574,2,"Practice @CAPS1 You @CAPS2     The @LOCATION1 is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. In the @DATE1's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In @LOCATION2 we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc. it would defeat the entire purpose of @LOCATION2 and it's @ORGANIZATION1.     Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @CAPS1 or @CAPS1 not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination.      I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @MONTH1 find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary.     I personally learned a lot of things from @CAPS1 I've seen on television. Whats on television @MONTH1 be considered 'street smart' education but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored then people would not know @CAPS1 to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before.     If books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves then @LOCATION2 is not practicing @CAPS1 it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom.",4,4,4,2
3575,2,"Censorhship should play a major part in which books should enter and leave the library. Thats why I think that if a book, movie, magazine, or cd should deffinitly should be removed from the shelf if it is found offensive to atleast ten children. Now it would be asking too much to have the libraian read through all the books to make sure there is no bad language or anything else that a parent might not want their child to read about. So therefore a library should have a certain section that if a libraian thinks that there might be some bad language or refrence to drugs or alcohol then that book should go into that part of the library. I have found some books that have some pretty graphic material in them that I dont think a little kid should be reading but there was nothing I could do about it except take it up to the libraian.      Movies would be a major thing that they would have to watch out for. Just because the movie has a title that dont seem that bad dont mean that there wont be any grapic images in that movie, or that there wont be any inappropriate language used at one point in the movie. Now since movies are alot easier to review and since they also have a rating then that should make it easier to tell if that movie should go on the shelves of a library or not. But there should deffinitly be a part in the library that if they did want to allow certain movies in there that would be inappropriate for little children then those movies should be put in that part of the library that has a door on it so the kids would know not to go in that room.      Music would be another thing you would deffinitly have to watch out for because with each song could change how the languge is in that cd. So I think that the librarian should have to sit down and persoanlly listen to that cd before they decide to put it out on the shelves for others to be able to listen to. But personally i think that there should be no music allowed in libraries just because with every new cd album that an artist makes he could easily change how his wording is in the songs. So you just never know what the artist of the song is going to do with his music. One album can be perfectly fine and not have one cuss word on it, but then the next album that he or she makes could just be loaded with cuss words.      Another possible way to prevent little kids from hearing or reading about inappropriate stuff is to have some of the books, magazines, cd's, or movies catagorized by age. As a child gets older he will be tought more about certain things. Then once he picks up that book and sees that its mentioned in the book it wont be that big of a shock to him or his parents. With the way things are today its almost impossible for a kid to pick something up and not read about drugs or violence. So if you were to go through and take everything off the shelf that mentioned drugs or violence then there would be nothing left on the shelfs for kids to listen to or read.      Your not going to be able to catch every single movie, book, magazine, or cd that has something to do with violence or alcohol use. But you can take some of the stuff that has alot of that kind of stuff in it off the shelf. By just taking some of the materials off the shelf that contain stuff that @MONTH1 seem inappropriate for children will deffinitly make a big difference and it could possibly protect your child from reading across it someday when he or she reads a book and sees that or listens to a cd and hears the artist metion something about that.      Game designers are now starting to make all their games around violene. So if you were to take all the games that have violence in them and take them off the shelf there would be no games left for kids to play. So there are just some things that contain violence that you just cant keep your child from seeing at one point in time. All the games have a rating on them so you should have an adult check that game rating before you let your child get that game. By doing that you will be able to somewhat controll what your child will see and it will also make it better because then you are not taking games that other kids might like off the shelf and making them no longer available.      So I have pretty much covered about how who ever is in charge of the games, books, movies and cds should look them over and possibly listen or look at them just to see what they are like before they put them out on the shelf. You dont have to censor everything but there are deffinitly some things out there that should not be put out on the shelfs for little kids to look at or listen to. And if a little kid wants to get a game a parent should have to look at the game and the rating of the game to determine if that child is mature enough to handle what goes on in that game. But overall I personally dont think that they should just go through and ban everything from going on the shelfs it should be up to the child to determine if they can handle what that movie or book contains",3,3,3,1
3576,2,"Do I believe that some books should be taking off the shelves if they are found offensive ?     Well what do you think ? I think they should depending on cause or what degeree of the party being offended. I feel if there are books ,movies,or music that are saying or showing a form of insluts then it depends on who is being offended.      If you have a racist book against all races like blacks,asian,or mexican etc... other minorities @MONTH1 find out about those forms of insults and they raise an issue about it, then yes take it off the shelves.      If you have a confrontation about it then it could get violent . Also, if you dont then they could sue you for racism or make it public to everyone that you are a racist library and you would loose business.      So to avoid all of the fighting and  lawsuits and other humiliation against you and the other minorites. If they bring up a situation then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well.           Plus , they only come here for an oppurtunity to start a new life cause usually they're coming from poverty srticken towns, homes countries. I myself, am not a racist person I think that we are equal just unique individuals we're all unique in our own ways  that is what makes us who we are today.",3,2,3,1
3578,2,"Today in society there are many things people have different views on. They can be religion, race, or brought up in a different way. Today in libraries there are many books of all types. They can relate to all different kinds of people. If one book is discriminating against another indivual is this right? I think the libraries need to stay the way they are and leave things the way they have had them for different reasons.       First off, no one is the same, what might be bad to someone else can be good to another person. If someone simply doesn't like the context of a book, movie, or even music ect. They don't have to read,watch,or listen to it. Since no one is the same what someone might not find appealing can be amazing thing to another person.     Second, this can be there for purpose. The @LOCATION2 wasn't always a equal place. If there are books that talk about the discrimination on other races I think it's simply showing history. If we didn't have history to look back on we wouldn't be able to see how @LOCATION1 has progressed. From slave states to all free states. I think it is important for material such as that to be left so it can looked on upon.     Third reason, is a library is suppose to consist of these different things such as books, movies, music ect. If we were to take everything out the libraries that comes off offensive it wouldn't be a place were you could find things that you wanted. It would probably be a boring place. If theres no variety in a library I don't see how it can be called a library. You can find whatever your looking for in a library whether its on how to do hair to the hitsory of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2.     In conslusion, these reason make up why libraries should stay the way they are. One is because what might be offensive to a ivdivual might be different to someone else. Second, it would take a lot away from history. Thrid, it wouldn't make a library what it is today. These are ligetament resaons why it should be left alone",4,4,4,2
3580,2,"I dont think books that would affend people should be on the shelf. some of the books that maybe on the shelf @MONTH1 hurt some ones feelings. But i also think people should beable to read what they want to read. many people wouldnt read a book that they think would affend them.      There are many kinds of books not all book will be bad or affend people. but books that are not apropriot for young kids or teens shouldnt even be in school librarys. In public librarys i think it should be ok to have every type of book. and have different books in different place's. like haveing the young adalt section and the adalt and children section.     I think screton books should be sold in book stores like i dont think they should have inapropeiout books in children book store's. They should have a different store for certain books. And parents should monitor what there children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying.      There are lots of parents that dont really care about what there kids read, and to me that's there busness but my apenioun is that they shouldn't let there kids read what they want. Parents should be with the child when he/she is picking out a book. But if it is a teen @DATE1 and older, i think they would be old enough to choise what they want to read. by the time they are that age they have matured enough to read and understand things much easer",3,3,3,1
3584,2,"TAKING THE @CAPS1 TO @CAPS2      Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life.  The author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language, racial remarks, slurs, etc. One offensive to a person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another.  I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community.     Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre.  The reader should know where he/she stands among these categories, so they will not be offended.  Maturity comes with understanding.            Books are sorted by genre.  Most, to all, times the @CAPS2 takes from the genre.  The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor.  When @CAPS2 an author must take this into consideration.  If the setting of the book was in @NUM1 A.D. the author would not want to use grammar from the present day.  The reader should be prompted on what books they @MONTH1 read before doing so.     From one reader to another, taking the @CAPS1 on what we read is the real solution.  Maturity comes with understanding.  If the reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2 then the book corresponds with the age of that child.  This is why I strongly agree that books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to one person, group, or community",4,4,4,2
3586,2,"Everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see. If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned? Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't? Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve?                                            What if @NUM1 people came into a library with  @NUM2 books, magazines, music and movies, and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out? Even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw? Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick? I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that. If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like.                                                                 If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it should they have to demolish it just like nothing?                The world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things. It could only get worse.              I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it. One solution could be just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could, otherwise have  separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges.

3589,2,"Censorship is a growing problem is today's world of literature.  Censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to.  Katherine Paterson says that if were all aloud to eliminate things that we thought were wrong, then there would be nothing left to be right about.  Censoring leads to an ignorant, opinionless, and clueless society.     In the novel '@CAPS1 @NUM1' censorship is one of the main themes of the story.  Bradbury portrays the burning of books as the way of ending all controversial opinions.  @PERSON3 finds that the burning of books has lead the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them.  The government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in hope that it would make for a happier society.  When in reality, members of the world are not happy and are consistently showing the reader that they do not know how to be happy.  @PERSON3 decides that he wants to learn, but he does not know how. The brain is a muscle, if it is not excercised correctly, it becomes weak and useless.  So when he tries to memorize a part of the @CAPS2, he cannot retain what he has been reading.  Such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand, he does not know how to learn.     The members of this novels society are basically opinionless on what is happening in their world.  What they are told on the television is thought of to be factual, and that is what they do all day.  In school, kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved.  In a normal society, learning leads to questioning.  But for them there is no learning, just accepting.  And acceptance leads to contentness, which in the end leads to unhappiness.     The society in '@CAPS1 @NUM1' proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways.  To them, death is not a big deal.  @PERSON2 was killed by a speeding car, and @PERSON4, @CAPS4 wife, was not even shocked to hear it.  Another example is when @PERSON3 was running from the police, and a car full of rambunxious teenagers attempted to run him over just because they wanted to.  At the end of the novel, @PERSON3 is walking along the railroad tracks with his new friends and the entire city is blown to dust by bombs dropped by fighter planes.  The city had no idea that this was going to happen, they were clueless to the war that was going on around them everyday!  A clueless society is a useless society, and in the end they were destroyed.      Censorship lies within the hands of the viewer.  Censorship has become such a big problem in the world when there are so many other things people should worry about.  Reading about somebody doing drugs will not make a child want to do drugs, it crosses every teenagers mind atleast once.  But instead of not allowing them to even realize that it is out there, parents should do what they signed up to do, teach your kids right from wrong and hope that you did it well.",4,4,4,2
3591,2,"Offensive or @CAPS1?     Who can truely say a book, movie, music, or magazine is truely offensive. There are some of the obvious movies that completely make fun of or taunt someone's personal views as a religion or lifestyle but is a book about a wizarding world really that offensive?     While growing up I had a friend who was very religious. Her parents would never let her read the @ORGANIZATION1 books by @PERSON1. At the time I didn't understand why she wasn't able to read such fantastic books. Now that I'm older I understand that her parents believe what is in 'The @CAPS2' and nothing more. Make believe and imagination was @CAPS1 a suitable thing fpr their child to read. For many families, though the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world. Should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended? I personally don't think they should.      While my family loves the books and movies some families don't. That is their lifestyle and their opinion. Everyone has an opinion, and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing. Movies would be boring, stories would @CAPS1 be interesting, and there would be no music.      If our world was based off of the opinions of others and making everyone happy we would @CAPS1 have music. Music is a way for someone to release their soul. The different sounds of music are based off generations. My mother's generation was based on @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 and mine is of @CAPS6, @CAPS7&@CAPS8, @CAPS9. So what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a @ORGANIZATION2. The shelves would be blank. Empty shelves would be a horrible look.      Everyone is offended by something. I'm offended by the rape scences in movies but some people believe in some situations it makes a movie better. My friend's family is offended by the make believe world of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and I believe that some where out in our world there is another world, a wizarding world as a matter of fact.      People believe in many different things and like many different things. I've never met one person who is exactly like me, because there is @CAPS1 one. I'm an individual like everyone else and if the things I liked were taken off a shelf because someone was offended then my life would be boring because I wouldn't have the things I enjoy. In some cases some offensive things should be taken off shelves but who am I to say it should be, because there is someone out there who believes it should be on the shelves of @LOCATION1",3,4,3,1
3595,2,"Libraries are for children, and adults of all ages. Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, @CAPS4 makes @CAPS4 hard for libraries to please everyone. There are also different genres that people enjoy reading. Some @MONTH1 enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries.     Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials. They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more. They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines. But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located.      On the back of movies there is a rateing on @CAPS1 bad the movie is. Why not put a rateing on the back of books and magazines? This way people can know what to expect if they read @CAPS4. @CAPS4 would also help them decide if they even want to read @CAPS4. Rateings on the back of magazines and books would help destinguish what age is appropriate for @CAPS4.      Once, when i was visiting the library, there was a man in the check out line, right before me. @CAPS3 was returning the book that @CAPS3 had just read and checking out the new one @CAPS3 had already picked out. When @CAPS4 was finally his turn in line @CAPS3 stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what @CAPS3 had wanted to do with his books. She simply understood that @CAPS3 wanted to check out and return one. As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, '@CAPS1 did you like your book, @CAPS2?' @CAPS3 replied ' @CAPS4 wasn't what i expected. @CAPS4 was completly inappropriate. ' As they disscussed a little more @CAPS4 turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book. This is one example of @CAPS1 people don't know what to expect when they read a book.      I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about. They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or movies. Some people @MONTH1 not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others @MONTH1 find @CAPS4 outragous. Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities. Why take a book off if only a few people find @CAPS4 offensive? No one makes those people read those books, its by their choice. Libraries need to figure out some way to reasure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by @CAPS4",4,4,4,2

If we start taking offensive books off the self then every body coming in would be taking @NUM1 books off the self.  Then with in two days there would be not books left.     If we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad. We should not take books off the selves because of some people like to read.  If people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books.     This is why people should not take offensice books off the selves. This will make peoples eyes so bad that they would not see good at all.",2,3,2,0
3600,2,"Parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages. That is where my opinion will start, and tell why it is that way. I will talk about why I disagree with this statement. Also, give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement.     I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like. The library is where they get the books from. So, just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there. I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book.     If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them. Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting. I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it. Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate.     Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it. This is taking a right away from us, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once. If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them? So, if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now. People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them.     This is my opinion of the statement. Many people @MONTH1 not agree but I just tried to make people to see my point of this statement. Then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy. Also, I hope people can still have their rights and not let a couple people take it away from them.",4,4,4,2

3605,2,"Censorship in Libraries     Censorship in libraries is a big problem in today's society, many people get angry at libraries and markets because of the items that they have on display for the common consumer. If the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read. What if they come accross a book from the early @DATE1's? In these times there were lots of words used that are 'harmful' to our people today, but what most people dont understand is that, these words that are harmful had different meanings in that time in history. So when someone picks up a book and finds harmful or un-appropriate words or phrases in them, they instantly get the wrong idea about the book. And then, this small group of people who dont like this piece of literature, go agains the vast majority of people who really do understand the literature, and the feeling and dialect of the book. That is where i am going to explain to this small group of people, a few details that they should keep in mind when trying to rip a book off of the shelf and throwing it away.     When someone goes into a store or library and starts to look for a book, they @MONTH1 come accross a piece of literature that they dont completely agree with. When this person comes across this piece of literature, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and move on. Nobody is forcing that person to read this book, so why make a big deal about it?  Because most people who make a big deal about some of the word usage in a book, dont quite understand the dialect of the book, or the time period the book was written in. If you do not understand the literature completely, then i ask that these people do not make a big scene out of it, and that they dont try to revoke the author's rights to have that piece of literature on the shelf.          Authors have just as many rights as we do. If they write literature. A poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf. So why would we not have the same rights? If we dont agree with some of the literature that are being placed in our society's schools, stores, and homes. Then we can write a novel, newspaper article, or even make a website about your topic. You can make web polls much more. This is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature. If you want to have a better chance of this book or novel to be removed from the shelves, you can use a poll or have people vote, to recieve other people's oppinions, and use these in your argument. If you have more than one oppinion on a subject, you @MONTH1 have a more likely chance of winning your argument. And this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you.     Another reason why i dont think that people should be able to choose what is on the shelves of libraries everywhere. I do not think that anybody from anywhere shoudl be able to come into a library and take a piece of literature off of the shelves forever. Because, in todays society, we have researchers going all of the time, and we have so many people working on different theories and laws. So if we take one important book off of the shelf, maybe a book written in the @DATE2's about evolution. And we get rid of all of these books, what will happen when we really need that information? These scientists @MONTH1 need that piece of literature to test a theory, and if that piece of literature is expelled from the shelves, then we could miss out on a large variety of major information that could help out someone in the future. So the more information we take off of the shelves, the less we will have in the future to help us will our problems.     So, now that i have told you all of my opinions on this subject, i hope that you will have a better view on the cencorship of libraries everywhere. And that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves, being endlessly read by consumers",3,5,3,1
3607,2,"In libraries and bookstores worldwide books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate, to serious or violent. These books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor, horror and empathy among many others. However, though these books are made for a specific purpose, it is sometimes unclear as to how the book is appropriate for the eyes of a young reader, or even a mature reader. These books appear unappealing and offensive. However, though they don't appeal to you as a reader, how could this book be censored without the unanimous disapproval of everyone? Censorship of these books is unjust because of the right of free speech and press, because all subjects are deserving of being written, and most importantly because target audiences deserve books written in their interest regardless of their approval.     The first reason that their should be no censorship of novels and works of literature is because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press. They are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in. Though many times they have used subject matter that is highly provocative or inappropriate, they still have the capacity and the legal ability to write about what they wish. To stop them from writing their own opinionated stories is similar to the censorship of books in nazi @LOCATION1. Millions of books were burned and hundreds, if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government. Even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader.     The next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed. Books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written. The variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular. For thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language. And though stories @MONTH1 not be written in a manner that would be appropriate for a child, it doesn't mean that the story shouldn't be written or read. Its use should simply be monitored so that only those capable of accepting or understanding its message are capable of reading it.     Lastly, censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people. Though the materials found in a story @MONTH1 be horrific to a parent, it @MONTH1 be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people. And to limit the literary subjects that people prefer could be parallelled with limiting a person's voice of opinion. It simply isn't reasonable to allow only a single category of work, with only a few varieties of messages, for only a select group of people. Variety is what seperates a person's opinions, and makes their being different than another's.     Therefore, censorship of literature should not be enforced. Writing topics should be open to all people, because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose. And because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium, there should never be a limit on these rights. That is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf.",4,5,4,2
3614,2,"I believe that it is unfair to ban ony sort of materials from the library.  It simply isnt right to withold information from your children.  Any information that they might read or hear is something that they are going to find out sooner or later anyway.  Wouldn't you much rather your children find out from reading it in a book or magazine or hearing it in a movie or cd?  Then they can ask parents any questions that they @MONTH1 have about things they have read and heard instead of hearing it from a teenager in the hall or talking to a friend about it and being misguided and given the wrong information.     If your child is to read about sex or an affair in a magazine wouldnt you like to know?  Would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong.  Wouldn't it be much easier to know that your child is educated on certian things so that they know when things are false and they're not confused or worried about something small?     Any of the things that they @MONTH1 read in a magazine or see in a movie are things that they could easily look up on the internet.  On the internet there are more graphic photos, and some websites give false information on subjects.  Your childs curiosity could take them to inappropriate websites.      When i was a child and I was curiouse my parents sheltered me from certian things. I found out what kinds of things they were trying to hide from me while I was only in @NUM1 grade when high schoolers on my bus told me all about sex, showed me pictures and told me things that I would have much rather heard about in class or read.  I felt like I couldnt talk to my parents about these things.  I mean what would you do if your second grader came home form school and started talking to you about the kinds of things that they had heard on the bus.  What if the high schoolers had been lieing to me, I would feel stupid for saying anything about it because my parents wouldn't have understood what I was talking about.      What I'm saying is that understand that there are some things that a child should never be allowed to read, see, or hear.  It isn't fair to them that they don't get the opportunity themselves to learn about it and ask questions. Besides isn't it your fault in all reality if they get they're hands on somthing innapropriate for their age becuase they aren't getting the proper supervision?  If you feel that they are reading, listening, or watching something that you feel is in appropriate, ask questions.  Explain things to them when they ask you a question.  Don't beat around the bush.  Make sure that they know the difference between good and bad, right and wrong. It truely is not fair to take these things away from them when they don't even know why they are not allowed to look at it",4,4,4,2
3615,2,"No because all people like to read different books. Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history.Books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out. When I was in middle school I always liked to read @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 books. When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no. They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and vilence. I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different all people like different types of books. Theres all kinds of books like for example theres mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc. The books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday. I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book.When I was in elementry and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer.In seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. We also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most. That was part of our grade in our english class. It was never a problem for me because i loved to read.Now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves. For example any book that involves nudity or lots of vilance. Now thats just for kids that are under the age of thirteen. Now there isn't that many of books out there for little kids to read. Theres more adult books than little kids books.All I have to say is that watch what your kids read. Don't keep them from reading books because that will effect them later on in life. If they don't like to read persuade them to try it. I also think that more kids would read if they seen their relatives reading too. Just remember kids and adults of all ages reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read.",4,4,4,2
3616,2,"In this persuasive essay i'm going to write about why or why not offensive material should be banned from library shelfs, and there are a couple reasons that are going to help me do that. I think that we should'nt take anything off the shelfs in libraries.      My first main point why we should not take any material off the shelfs in libraries is that there are some material that people might find offensive that others do not and are getting affected by those who do want these material off the shelfs. I think that some of the movies and books that is taken off the shelfs should be material that some kids should experience that @MONTH1 help them in the future.     My second main point is that if we do take all of the offensive material off the shelfs there would only be movies and books like bambi and scooby-doo, because all the material that are in libraries are offensive to people in some ways different than others. I have not found a movie or book in any library yet that I have found offensive.      Also if we do, we might as well not even have a library, because there would only be about @NUM1 movies and books in the whole building, because of all of the offensive material that people could find in cd's, books, and movies.     People hear cuss words probably everyday, whether its at school or home. So all of the words and actions in movies are not as bad as people in real life saying them. I just think of every movie and book as just a movie and book. Scary movies are not real and some books too. There is sex and other inapropriate things in movies, but thats also why you have to be a certain age to even get the movies.      To summarize up what I was just talking about in the last couple paragraphs, I think that we should not take any thing off the shelfs in libraries, beacuse it will hurt others, and theres just no need in it",4,4,4,2
3622,2,"If you have been a child with parents who cared, then you have heard them say, 'No you can't play that game, you can't listen to that music, or you can not watch that movie.' @CAPS1 you asked why you were not allowed the same answer was always givin, 'You're not old enough.' If you ever had the courage to ask why again they would most likely have said, '@CAPS2 if I wanted you to know then I would allow you to find out for yourself!', and that didn't get you anywhere now did it?     Now I would like for you to think back on those things you were not allowed to do, and how now that you are old enough you can do those things. How would it change things if those movies, @CAPS3's, or games had been removed from the shelves before you had the chance to get to them?  What would you and your friends have done if you didn't get to watch '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8' that night because some parent or other individual had had it removed from the market because they found it offensive?     I would also like for you to think about the child you @MONTH1 have or @MONTH1 plan to have, would you want your child to be subjected to such things as '@DATE1 The @NUM1' or '@CAPS9 and @CAPS10' as a @NUM2 year old? Most likely that answer is 'no', but what if, because they were found offensive, they were simply removed from existence? Then they would never see them and to some that @MONTH1 be what's right, and for those of you who think that I have some news for you, those kind of movies are still made today.  '@DATE1 The @NUM1' has been remade and is more graphic than before, and there are countless other titles that i could throw @CAPS6 you now that have some form of sexual themes, drug use, or foul language. They still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies.  There are @CAPS11 movies that will have some sort of sexual reference, a cigarette, or a bad word in them.     You might be able to get rid of a few, but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them. But let's say that you did, that you were, in fact, able to throw away any title that contained these themes.  What would there be left to watch?  If those movies do not exist any more, then what would your kids have to be able to watch, @CAPS12 the @CAPS13 and @CAPS14-@CAPS15? Not only that, but what movies would you watch, if all movies with something offensive in them were removed then you wouldn't have anything left for yourself.  Every thing that you might like and/or think is funny in a film, but don't want your child to see is gone.     My answer to you is to not just throw everything out that @MONTH1 be offensive, or that you might not want your child to see.  Instead of going to such drastic measures to shield your child from them, but to simply not allow them to watch those movies or listen to that music. It's what I'm sure your parents did you, and I know it's what mine do to me, and guess what?  It has worked so far, so why should we change it?",5,5,5,3
3624,2,"A kid walks into the library up town. He looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch. He checks it out and goes home to watch the movie. Later on, his parents come home to see their son acting out of the ordinary. He starts to say rude comments, being violent, and using profanidity. Who is to blame? The friend who recommended the movie, or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out?     Today, many libraries have a variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. Some libraries even have computers for kids, teenagers, and adults to use for certain things such as business, personal mail on websites, or games for kids to play.     But are all the libraries meeting their requirements? Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and even websites threatning. Libraries have movies that are rated @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM1, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. They @MONTH1 also have music that has explicit lyrics on the @CAPS5. Some libraries @MONTH1 not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others.     In my opinion, I think that if a library has offensive material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves. If the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music, and @CAPS4 movies, they should possibly be fired. From my own experience, I have not had trouble with libraries and materials they have to choose from. I have not visited a library that has had explicit music to choose, all of the bad websites are blocked on the computers, and all of the magazines are appropriate for all ages.     In conclusion, libraries should have respect not only for people, but for the materials they have. They need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents. Censorship is required for every library and I think that all the libraries around do meet their requirements.",4,4,4,2
3626,2,"The seven books which constitute the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series by @PERSON1 are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. Many books, from @PERSON2's 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account. Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive.      Under the @ORGANIZATION1 to the @CAPS7, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press and religion. By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied. It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right.      By prohibiting books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to be read; the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded. Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 (the @CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual. However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1.      However, even if every school in the country took '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' off the shelves; that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books. Since 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the @DATE1, it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute. That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'.      If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. But just because one parent does not want their child to read '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere.      Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works; the children will still find a way to access them",5,5,5,3
3629,2,"People from all over the world have many different opinions. If someone doesnt like something they do have the choice of not looking at it. Therefore, I believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it.     One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldent be taken out of the libraries is because, not everyone @MONTH1 feel the book, movie, magizine, or music is offencive. People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read.     Another reason I feel the bad things shouldent be taken out of the library is because, some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library. Many people like the offencive things in books, movies and soforth. I think from my own prospective that I like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magizine is what it takes I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good with out haveing to worry if its there or not.     In my own opinion, I believe that with out offencive remarks or words there wouldnt be any humor in books and stuff today. Just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are. It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny.     Although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate, I believe that if they're there then obviously there not too bad, and they shouldnt be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library. Everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do.",4,4,4,2
3635,2,"Should materials in libraries be censored? No, i dont think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. If something is offensive to someone then that person doesnt need to look at that material. People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library and if someone doesnl't like the materials they have then thats too bad.     What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf ? If a kid were to get something bad or innapropriate for themselevs the libraries wont let them check it out so it is fine, and the parents should be watching the kids get.     I go to the library all the time and I have never seen anything thing that is innapropriate and i don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library, because I think the libraries know what people want and what people dont want there. and it's not right to take something off the shelfs if a few people dont like it because im sure other people like it. But if there is something very offensive that everbody thinks is bad than you can remove but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive because then there probally wouldn't be anything left in the library.

3637,2,"Should we have the right to be able to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive? I believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this. I believe that if we had the right there would be no materials left for future children to read. A big thing to consider when you think about this right, is even though our materials speak of discrimination, or use a word that someone might find offensive, or even if we did not like the book, movie or magazine and thought that it was a waist of space. We should never have the right to be able to remove these materials.     I know of several people that think the harmless childs first book is trying to discriminate someone, or a race of people. There are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people, or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against. If we would have the right to remove these materials, all of them would eventualy be gone. Our future children wouldnt know that the event even happened or if they did half of their information would more than likely be wrong, since over years people would probably change the story to a version that they wanted their child to think.     If someone found one single word in the book or even a movie that they thought was offensive then they would have the right to remove the material from another persons view. If someone found a curse word in the material that they found offensive, or if they just find the idea of using curse words offensive they would be able have the material removed and that would mean that thousands of good books and movies would disappear for a word that one person did not like.     Some people might find them to be a waist of space and just remove it, if they did not like the book, movie, music or magazine. There are some people out there that like to read or listen to them and @MONTH1 find some of the them that we cant stand to look at, good or entertaining. Some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are. These arent ways to judge a book.     I think that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf. We all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations. Past people in the world have destroyed materials that they didnt like, now we will never know what they were about or even trying to tell us. There is no reason to remove a material just for the oppinion of one person or even the oppinion a a group of people.",4,4,4,2

I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive.      First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not. For example, many people have different intrests than others. Some people @MONTH1 like certain kinds of books and movies while others @MONTH1 not. For instance, one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy. On the other hand, there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies. This is something you can not change. Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy? There are other ways to solve this problem.      I believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library. For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it. These materials do not have to be removed completely. Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive. If these materials are seperated from others, there will not be a problem. Certain materials do not have to be removed completly from a library.      All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests. In conclusion, I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being to offensive",4,3,4,2
3640,2,"There are many different types of books, music, movies, magazines,ect., that fill the shelves of libraries and stores across the country. Consumers are constanly taking these items off the shelves without realizing what they are really buying. Some parents @MONTH1 not even realize what their teenagers or little children are actually buying. Some of the material @MONTH1 be offensive and have a bad influence on those who buy into them. But if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem. That is why these materials should remain on the shelves.     One vital reason these items should not be taken away is because it is the consumers choice on whether or not they want to buy or check out these items. People should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy. If they do not want to buy or check these materials out then then they should just go to another shelf, or shop at another store. I have seen some parents who do not really care what their children buy, and I have also seen parents go the other way. If stores take away these items that it is almost like taking away their right to make a choice.      It is the adult's responsibility if they do not want their children to watch movies that are for mature viewers. The parent should be able to prohibit certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions. If they trust their children with these materials then that is their choice. These offensive items can not just be taken off the shelves just because some people are bothered by them. With the way the media works, it would be difficult to remove all these items from libraries and stores. No matter what there will probably always be a way for younger children to be exposed to these materials. On television there is always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to but their stuff. I have also seen music videos and magazines with their favorite celebrities on the covers. It is almost impossible to control every aspect of society to make it appropriate to younger viewers.      If all the people were able to take all the items that they did not approve of off the shelves, then there would be many of these shelves left empty and bare. If everyone were to take a book they did not like off the shelf then there would be a little selection at the libraries. By taking off one of these books, someone could be taking off another persons favorite book. People can not just take books off the shelves because they have some bad language. There is a reason for separating the children's section from the adult's section, and it is because some books might not be appropriate for all readers. From my personal experience I have not seen any problems with kids checking out offensive books. Most little kids are attracted to the children's section because of the colorful pages and simpler words.     There is a variety of materials available to the public that @MONTH1 be offensive to some, especially to their little children. As a parent it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown. People can not take materials off the shelves because it is only offensive to some. This would not be fair to those who enjoy these kind of materials. If they do not want to buy it then they should simply move on to another shelf or to a completely different store. It is their choice as the consumer on whether or not they want to buy into the many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, ect.",4,4,4,2
3642,2,"Dear @CAPS1 paper,     I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well.  For example, I believe that certain books shoud be removed from the library shelves because, under age children also attend the library, and because, other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displaed in a library. My disagreement to the situation is that the its a library, and libraries have different types of books.          First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because, it a public library and not only adults attend that library, but under age children as well. I know that certain books under age children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprivcd of their privlliages of staying in the library reading such books.          Next, I do not agree that cerain books should be viewed on library shelves because, other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library. The reson I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people race, and if for say a black, mexican, maybe even a arbiana person was to come in the library looking for a book and happen to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensive.          However, I do not think that any book being deprived from a libray. My reason for thinking that is simply because its a library, and libraries are developed for many peole types of intrest in books. And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropraite in certain people interest in books. And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive.          Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book becuase it lacks intrest in someone or offend someone. And that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people point of view.",3,3,3,1
3643,2,"When u go places there will alway be something that one won't like not everyone likes everything. A library has to be the worst place for people not liking things. Censorship in libraies is getting worse and worse everyday, it is in everything in books, movies, music, and magazines. Should we keep things like this on shelfs? Everyone that will read this will think differently about censorship in libraries.     On the shelfs is lots of things with bad laugauge naughty pictures. These books little kids can pull off a shelf and see things that there parents dont want them to see. Censorship is everywhere not just in libraries. The books and things in the libraries need to be changed and not be so bad. If there is a need for things like this Then have a special store for things like this",2,2,2,0
3650,2,"There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out.  It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting.  The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on.  The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it.  Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them.  Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.      Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses.  Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides?  Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading.  If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world.       Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives.  We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music.  If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not.  The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.     In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders.  The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective.  If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public",4,5,4,2
3653,2,"Maybe, to a sense I do not think that boo'ks should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is becasue that some books, magazine and other stuff can be informative. They can help you wtih certain questions. They @MONTH1 not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have.      But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People @MONTH1 take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other poeple. The sense of this nautre is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book.      If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives. They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to terach. They @MONTH1 think they are doing t the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff. You @MONTH1 not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming.      Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They @MONTH1 not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have. Certain books @MONTH1 stay on the shelf such as a @CAPS1 book. @CAPS1 books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body. So the @CAPS1 books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings.     The @CAPS1 magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the @CAPS1 items. People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not. Not you would not becasue a @CAPS1 book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you. That also could go for the sexual magaizes. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast. You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine. I know that @CAPS1 books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults.     As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of @CAPS2's or music but othe people do. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days.        If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves. People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others.      If you go back to the @NUM1's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now.      Generations change and so does the enivorment but  you can not change they way we grew up. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough and they wont let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours.     Its not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another",4,4,4,2
3655,2,"This essay is all about wether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some.     I do not believe things should  be removed from shelves in libraries if they offened someone. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean its offensive to all . If you are offeneded by somethings they display there are ways that you can avoid seeing them. One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it , ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need , or try to search what your looking for on the internet.     When i visit the library I already know what im going to get so i have never found anything offensive to me. If I did find something offensive to me I would complain and if they didnt do anything about it I would just never go back. I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs.      The libraries I go to always have sections seperating the different age groups. The sections are split into children , teens , and adults . I' ve been to the library numerous times and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive. If the library had something that would offense me I wouldn't know. Everytime I go I stay in one paticular section for teens and look at magazines and books .      I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't",3,3,3,1
3657,2,"I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.",4,5,4,2
3658,2,"Have you ever been at the library and asked yourselve any of the following questions? Who reads this? Why is it here? Are kids reading or watching this stuff? Do kids check these out? Or have you ever wondered or said to your self any of these statements? I don't want my kids to pick this up and read this. This is so offensive. This goes against all our morals. I don't know what kind of freak convention this is but I'm no part of it. Lets get out of here. This place is wack. Ever consider what books get banned from the library? Who bans the books?          I think things should have to be very offensive to pull them off the shelves. I think that they should just stick them to a side of the library and put a age on it or you have to be a certain age to check out those books. I dont think the cussing books are that offensive. When the person (No matter who it is)goes out into the world. They are going to learn and hear curse words. People use them like they do the words 'and' or 'the'. They are going to hear them till thier grave. Wheather they chose to use them or not that's thier choice.        For them to be banned or moved to a diffrent group of books they should have to be sexist, raciest, have alot of sex, or just really grusome. I think they should go upstairs with the mushy romance and wacked out western. I mean people could go up there and check them out but that is the adult library area. The staircase should be by the circulation desk. When they are not busy they should go upstairs and check and see if there are any young children up there.      I think The top level or a certain area should be the adult area. They have mushy lovey dovey stuff, they have cow boy shoot off stuff, and the offensive stuff. The stuff with too much sex, really raciest, or really sexist, or grusome stuff like people killing people for fun.Also they should have the adult magazines up there too. Don't act like you don't know what im talking about. You know how you go down a aisl at the @CAPS1 market and there are girls in thier bikini and half naked. Then there are the cosomos both should be upstairs. I mean they talk about how to give pleasureable sex. I would hate for some little @NUM1 year old or @NUM2 year old to pick that thing up she would be scarred for life.      Then the main level or area should be teen books. You know vampire books, @CAPS1 heros, crazy fiction stuff, and then the magazines and movies that aren't bad. Then the bottom level should be the children level. Games puppets and movies and easy books. That about sums that up.      I dont think just anybody should be able too ban a book. I think it should be open but not just anyone. There should be a huge meeting. With the mayor, a couple teachers one english teacher from each level, and parents, and the librabiens. The person who wants in banned should have to tell everyone why and stuff. Like Author Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have the exact same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left for any of us.",5,5,5,3
3660,2,"I think that certain materails should not be removed because a couple people do not like what is in a book, or movie, or in music. If we where to listin to what everyone said and remove the books that they do not like then other people would not have anything to read. For example if a man came in a library and asked the library to remove a book that is about murdering and has violence in it. A person that @MONTH1 come in the library daily @MONTH1 want to read that book because that is the type of books that the man likes.     Another example is if a person has children that come into the library and there children were watching movies about gangs,drugs,and violence, the mother would want that movie removed from the library. I say that if the mother does not want her children to watch the movies they do she should say something to them and punish them every time they are cought watching it. Instead of parents trying to remove the books that many other people like they should be more disciplined with there children.A way for the library to stop children from geting movies or books they should not be reading is to put all the books and movies in a special area where it will be watched. Many people like movies with drugs, and violence. There type of movies or books should not be removed because of what another person thinks about that certian thing.     I also think that if a person does not like the type of language or images in a book or movie then they should not read it or watch it. And if they say there children watch it or read it without there permission then that is there fault and they should know more about what there young children are doing instead of trying to get that book, movie removed sometimes books and movies have very offensive languge but that is because they are just trying to show some of the stuff that happens in the real world. They want the movie or book to be as real as posssible.",3,3,3,1
3666,2,"Going to the library you would think of it as an family environment, wouldn't you? I know that when I think of the library I do not think or offenceive material that would make anyone upset. Surprisingly many of the libraries do and I do not think that they should be alouded to, since it is not aimed just for adults.     Children loved to go to the library to check out books and many more things that they  enjoy, but a five year old does not need to see a movie, a book, or anything else for that matter descrimanting against the other gender or another race. These materials should not be able to sit apon the shelves no matter what the writers say if they are putting someone down. The writers or the library owners wouldn't let there own children read it so why should it be okay for someone else child to read or watch it.  I'm not the only one who thinks this, I am sure that there are millions of people like me that would not appericiate their loved ones finding these things and reading them.        The information that young ones see or hear while they are still young will carry on with them throughout their life; who knows what they will do or think when there are old enough. Theses places are supposed to be an family place where you can go to get information not for someone to pick up on violence, drugs, racistism, and any other diragotori subjects. Young kids are not the only ones that should not be reading these cruptied material; teenagers and adults are more likely to understand it better and take the subjects into account.     I am begging these library owners to please take these offensive materials out of their branches; not only because small children could see them, but adults does not need to be reading, listening, or watching these things either. If you would not want oyur child to why would anyone else want their child too?",3,3,3,1
3669,2,"I do not think books should be censored from the shelves of library's. Katherine is correct in many ways. We would not have any books if everyone removed the ones the disliked. The world would lose alot of information on important things in their worlds. I'm writing this to explain why I don't think books should be censored.     I don't think book's should be removed if they are offensive to some people because they, sometimes, help people see the errors in their ways like a book about gloryfiying the way white men and women treated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 men and women. now a days people would read that book and if they were racist they wouldn't be after that book,because they see how wrong @CAPS7 is. Music is freedom of speech, some artist's see themselves as 'liberaters', 'idol's',and even 'love spreading',yes their are some songs that could be 'seem' offensive but you'll never know how high a @CAPS3 will grow if u cut @CAPS7 down In example the song titled '@CAPS4' by @CAPS5 @CAPS6,@CAPS7 has catholic churches furious because they automaticly assume she's disrespecting @CAPS8 when in reality she's speaking a whole different tone.     People learn special, powerful  life leasons from things or situations that are shunned by our society and @CAPS7 will probably always remane that way,we don't know.But one thing we do know is we can change what we do in the present and better what were going to do in the future.",4,3,4,2
3671,2,"Should books, movies, magazines etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. No, because all you have to do is ignore it or not pay any attention to it and it shouldn't bother you that much. Most people might look at something and think it is interesting like something that happened on the news lately and was published on newspapers or put on the internet. For example, the @LOCATION1 story, that has been on the news for the past week, people think that it is awesome that he is was finally found and killed. If people found that offensive that might be because they don't know what he did or wasn't around when it happened.     If they took down stuff that was offensive then we would have nothing interesting to read. If someone found a movie that was racist the don't get it, just put it back and find something else like a romance or a comedy. Everybody could use a laugh every once and a while. For music if your friend recommends something to you, check it out on the internet first to see if it is any good, if not then tell them no and that you find it offensive. If they were a true friend then they would understand and perhaps make it up to you with something else.      Magazines, from what I know don't really have anything offensive in them. The only thing the have a some pictures, gossip, facts, and some stories that might peak your interest. Books might have something things that you find offensive but, if you like the book so much you might as well finish it. If you found a book that you really like then read through it a bit or check it out on the internet to see what is about. Out of all the books I have read, I have found none of them offensive they were all good books, books that i would probably read again if I wanted to, but I won't, because I'm lazy.      Newspapers are interesting to read and might have little to none offensive remarks in them. Some might pertain to blacks or mexicans, something like that. Well I haven't read any like that yet but, I have heard somethings about it. In the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers. I think that if you find something offensive then just ignore it and move on to something else instead  of throwing a fit about it because that wouldn't do well at all.",3,4,3,1
3674,2,"The content of a library should be full of various material even if one @MONTH1 find certain materials offensive.  Just because someone @MONTH1 think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether?  Some subjects @MONTH1 be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them.     One subject that @MONTH1 be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases.  You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area.  It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.     Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history.  Some history @MONTH1 be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them.  The @CAPS1 for example.  That was a very dark period in history.  Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in.  It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is.  We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.     People's likes in music vary.  There are so many different types and styles of music.  Some music @MONTH1 be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library?  The library should always have a large variety of different music.  Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.      Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing.  Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information.  If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information.  Having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject.",4,4,4,2
3675,2,"Your watching a movie on tv that you and your friend have seen in theatres. You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the tv skips over that part because people think that that sceen is inapropiate. Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strick when it comes to movies, music, and books.     Some of the movies that are popular will end up on tv for the viewers entertainment, @CAPS1 some movies have sceens that are a little inapropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the tv compaies will cut that sceen out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The tv companies even censor historical movies. If its a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story.     Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids. If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music.     Book tend to be censored and even banned at schools. Not too many childrens read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want besause reading helps the mind. Some schools banned books becuse of inapropiate language. That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime. Some books are just too good to be banned.     A lot of theings seem to be censored in this world. We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so stricked when it comes to movies, music, and books.",3,3,3,1
3676,2,"The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need to research at the library @MONTH1 be considered inapproproate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This @MONTH1 include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow.     At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper @MONTH1 include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student @MONTH1 write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it.

My freshman year we read @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scences and see the movie for what it really was. If this move was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it.     Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material. Many books in this section @MONTH1 include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and @MONTH1 even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives.     If libraries start censoring books we @MONTH1 end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains.",4,4,4,2
3682,2,"For as long as people can remember books have been banned for various reasons. Whether it be a time of war or a religious restriction, it is always viewed as a negative thing and therefore should be no different today. Though it @MONTH1 be a bit less extreme, books or content such as movies, music, or magazines should not be removed from library shelves based on someone else's opinion. It is a right to be able to obtain the information theses materials offer. No material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship.     Some @MONTH1 argue that certain material @MONTH1 be offensive to other groups of people, but who is it to judge how another feels.  Material is written or made to show the feelings of the author and how they want thier feelings or knowledge portrayed. The author is merely taking advantage of their freedom of speech. It is at the responsibility of the public to how they use the information they receive. It is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason.      Religion is always a hot point when it comes to censorship, but is that not in our constitution. Freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions. Most have holy books and writings. Many express their religion by means of music and culture. It is a right for the public to be able to access this material.     There are some rare situations when restrictions @MONTH1 need to be upheld but merely based on age. This however doesn't restrict the public, but offers parents the right to censor what information their children are able to get ahold of. An age limit on specific types of material could be added in the cases of sexual content, vulgar images, or distrubing content unsuitable for children. This way information is never censored completely.     It is never right to tell people what they can or can not know. It is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely. Censorhip of these materials is not and never will be the answer. Although, age restrictions @MONTH1 be an answer for younger citizens these materials aren't taken away from the public. Whatever it @MONTH1 be called, book banning or censorship, it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems.",4,4,4,2
3684,2,"Have you ever watched a movie that had some scenes you didnt't want your kids to watch with you? What are you suppose to do when this problem happens time and time agian? Do you just tell your kids to close there eyes and cover there ears? Well i honestly think that shouldn't ever have to happen to you.     I think that you as a parent or adult should be warned about certain behaviors during a moive. That you do not approve your child of watching even if it is with you ,it's just flat out wrong I would say. So i say that we should get some kind of extra warning that these innapporiate behaviors are showing up in movies. Parents should be able to know what there kinds are bout to watch is ok for there age and what not.      So to wrap this all up nice and sweet. Just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also. That there might be things that a parent will find innapporiate for a child to watch or read. If the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children",3,3,3,1
3689,2,"NO, I do not think that books, music, magizines and etc. should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Books help people in many ways. Music helps people find their activity in many ways. Also magizines helps people do things thats meant to be done.      The reason I said books help people is because it furthers one knowledge to understand things better. It also hepls one vocabulary more stronger than it once was. Last but not least it helps people become more focused and when saying that I mean that it makes you understand how to be focused on the main idea and the whole concept of the book. When people read and they don't understand what they are reading, they look further to try and understand the words they misunderstood which is good because you will learn alot more then you thought you did.      Music is also a very good thing to use because it make people calm when they have had an long stressful day at work, school, doctor, or etc. Music also helps you look into your creativity which means you want to do more things such as dance, sing, or some even start to paint. When im tired and I have had a long day , I like to go home and lay down and listen to music and that is because I feel relaxed and more calmer.      Last but not least, magizines. Magizines gives you alot of information that one @MONTH1 be seeking for. Just say that you were looking for a recipe and you don't have an computer and you have magizines, you can look and a magizine and see when was this recipe effective and by whom it was wrote. Also if you were to want to order some things such as shoes, clothes, perfume fragrances, lotions and some even order house hold things if needed. When I look in a magizine,I like to order shoes or even just compare the prices of something store bought or the magizine price. There are many different things you can look foward to when looking in a magizine. So take my advive and try it because sometimes what your'e looking for can be right in your library.      With all that being sad books, music, and magizines can be very helpful to you and any body else. Books are very helpful when it comes to essays or etc. Music is very useful when youv'e had a long day at your place of buisness or etc. Magizines are very self explanatory when it comes to food, clothing, shoes, topics , essays ,cars ,houses or etc. When you have a question or a concern or maybe even a doubt you can go to your nearest own personal library and borrow or read a book, magizine or listen to a little music. All  these things can be helpful and all you have to do is take in it and take advantage of free information that is given to you. All of these things can help you in a way",4,4,4,2
3690,2,"There are people that are officave to all kinds of people. So what will make it different if someone writes a book that someone else doesn't like it should not matter if someone does not agree with someone else desion on a book cause someone else might like his or her book.There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc that someone will not like that is just part of life it you ask me. So i think haveing books that some people dont like is a great thing to have in are world. It tell you whether people are going out to see what is going on in are world if people are really caring about what other people write or say to other people.There is just one thing that people should allows keep in mind when they are write a movie or even in your local new paper the articles that some people put in the movies and papers are taking a little to far sometimes by what people say. I do bevlive that there should be a line as to what you can and not write in a book and i think that should be deminded by the write of his best judgement.Why do some people complane about everything that is meant to be told to them is because they know that what he or she is saying is very true and they dont want other people to know there past if it is bad or of sumthing tragic has happend top them whether it be in ther family something bad happend to them but i think if somebody would talk to this person they would not get so mad at someone for speeching the truth to the public.Well you have heard my side of the store on what i think about peoplle getting mad at other people for what they say and i belive that what you say is very true that we do ahve a freddom in this country.",3,3,3,1
3694,2,"I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the yound @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 section, easy children or picture and @CAPS1.      Young @CAPS1 or the @CAPS2 section is for mainly the teens. They have books that a teen who normally read. The @CAPS2 section has music which teens listen to. For @CAPS4 they have the twlight soundtrack. This section does not have any explicit language.The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the select of books offered to them.It has everything most teens like to read about. There is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed.     There is also a childrens section called the easy or picture book section. This section are for the younger children. Children that are not in school or in the early stages of school. The books, music an movies in this section are cartoons an animals. Things that children would like to read, listen or watch about. For @CAPS4 this section has movies like strawberry shortcake, athur, even lilo and stitch. eveything in this section is made for children there is not one thing in this section where the child or parent who think is offensive.     The library has a section for adults. The @CAPS1 section is there to catch adults eye. It a separate fom the @CAPS2 and Children sections. It is located at the other end of the library. If there is an @CAPS1 who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library. Most adults do not have a problem with the items in thier section. The library keeps the adults section with things that adults would want to look for. It would not have something little children would want.      The entire library is split up into different sections. It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same. There are only a few that I named but every age group has a specific spot at the library. If there is something found offensive to the people I dont think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section. The library takes great precaution to the censorship of their books, movies music etc",3,4,3,1
3698,2,"In @DATE1, there are many rap/hip-hop artists. They all sing about gangs, narcotics, alcohol, and using women for favors. @DATE1 is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age. There are children that know the words to alot of the rap songs out there. The parenting skills of some parents also reflect on if the children learn the words or not.     I understand that children have to be exposed to some things in life. There are other genres of music that deal with all of the things i listed above. I dont think that it is right though for young children to learn about these things. How would you feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are ? Or what alcohol is? I also understand that we should let our kids get a little taste of the real world to see what it is like for themselves but that can only go to a certain extent. After that extent, the kids would be learning too much at such a young age.     In my personal opinion, we could let our children listen to an edited version of the songs or even chose a different genre that doesnt use those such topcis as much. Country music for example is very peaceful to me. I suggest that people listen to it because it is very realistic in ways. I also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too. Everyone has a different outlook on what kind of music children should be allowed to listne to. I will sometimes listen to rap music but i would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version.     Magazines also have alot to do with why children are so 'street' smart these days. Magazines can put false information out so people will believe it. Magazine companies put revealing pictures of people on the front cover to catch someones attention. It works most of the time and children also see that. They are young and nieve so they will do what they see someone else do. That includes looking at the magazines with good looking men or women on them.     Another subject is the movies that are coming out in @DATE1 world. Movies can reveal whatever they want. Normally the movies that are inappropiate for children are rated @ORGANIZATION1 will find a way to see @DATE1 stuff. A child could be on the internet and something accidentally pops up. All of the advertisements on the side of the computer screen are viruses just waiting for children to click on it unintentionally.     These are my strong opinions on what we should do with todays society. We need to try and watch what our children are listening to and watching. I know that we cant watch their every move but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch. Thank you for your time!",4,4,4,2
3704,2,"Do you think that books, music, movies, magazines and other media material in libraries should be censored? Why should information and knowledge be with held from people? Learning is exceptional for not just only the person reading, but also the human race.     There are two arguments to cenorship in libraries. I believe in not allowing censorship in libraries. In the @ORGANIZATION1, everyone is given the right of free speech. Taking someones work and blocking it because it is 'unorthodox' or 'offensive' takes away that persons' rights. Also, people go to libraries to find something out. They look for knowledge and taking away a persons' learning capacity can be harmful to everyone. When one article gets censored another artical after that gets censored and soon most material will be 'offensive' and 'unorthodox.' We will take away man kind's capacity to learn.     Many reasons support censoring for minor offenses such as: inappropriate language in songs, books, movies, and magazines. Also, obscene graphic material in movies and in magazines. These are small issues that can be blocked and censorships can make a clean version. All minor adjustments and easy to make.     Taking media off the shelves is not needed. The material is not serious enough. Minor adjustments can be made so that people can be allowed to read, listen, or watch. A library is made forwhat the people want to learn. Taking that away is very serious.",4,4,4,2
3712,2,"Hello, I am writing to you today about my concerns about my views on the cencorship in a library.   First, I think some of the music they play and listen to can be a little graphic. I know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others. Music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life.   Second, I would like to talk about some of the books libraries have. I think if they want adult type material they should have a section just for adults. reading sould be about what you like but it should also be about what you are able to read.    Next, I would like to talk about some of the inapropriate magazines that some libraries feature. Some magazines show off a little to much for some of the people that go to the library.Most magazines that are show are for adult and teen over a certain age.I believe they should make a section for each of the ages and age group.   Finally, I would like to get on some of the movies they let people check out. Libraies has a graphic selection of movies that are easily in the reach of young children. Children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all. Libraries need to learn more about there surroundings before they continue what they are doing.   In conclution, I believe that everyone has the right to a library I just feel everyone doesn't have a right to have everything libraries hold. Bad things create bad minds and we have to learn to stay above those influences.Libraries need to change some of there ways and there selections to make things more sucessful on thier behalf",3,3,3,1
3717,2,"Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well people have the right to look at what they want, to hear what they want. Some think its not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves.Some people think its alright. I gusse it all just depends on that person and thier feelings.      Lets say i was in the library and i did see  something offensive. well the world does not stop and say ''hey look at that @ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so lets take that off the shelves just to please her''.  Am sorry but thats not how life works. If you dont like looking at it then turn the  other way. If it were me i would be worried about more important things such as war or things going  on in my life other then something offensive on the book shelves.     Its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. There are going to be things in life we the people dont like to look at, to maybe hear thats offensive. Heres what i say to it, get over it .          The other  day i was at the bait shop and i heared a word that  i dare not to even  say and i hate hearing that word. What was i going to do tell a grown man to not say that?...... I just  rolled my eyes and went on about my  buisness.          Should books, music, ect; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well like ive  been saying this whole time, in live there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you. You have to get over it . Sometimes geting over offensive things that you see are not easy but hey lifes not  easy",3,3,3,1
3718,2,"If I found a book that offendide me i would have to go and take it off the shealf because if I find that a book is offensive i know that others would think the same. I agre some books can be offensive to some and not to others and its really not fare for thows who think that way.     One reason that i would take it for that shelf would be to keep youn childern form reading it. Parents dont really want there childern reading about vilence and murdare.      Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist agents another person or people. people killing others and be doing sexaule things. People really shouldent read things like that because it puts things in there heads and somtimes make the think the same way as the writer.     If childern read books about vilence and sexaule actions they could think that its ok to do these things to other people and get in to alot of trouble with the law and there parents. Children really need to be keped way from these kinda of books, tell there older and undersdtande whats right and whats wrong. Some books have alot of cursing in them and alot of childern pick up on words and start using them more and more tell it becomes a habbit.     Evern thow some books are of real people they should still be taken off the shealfs. In some of these books there is alot of vilence and childern should not be exsposed to that kinda of book     Books can sometimes be more bad then good. If everbody had there way and could take a book that offendid them off the shealf whenever they wanted then there would be no books left.",3,3,3,1
3719,2,"If a people want to remove books, movies, music, magazines, and exetra then they will if they feel it is offensive to others. I wish they would not ,but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so. They feel that if someone can find some kind of offensive thing then they will feel it is okay to say or do thoughs things that they read or hear. It also commine sence to not do thoughs things that people wrote about. The auther's wright things to intertane and to egicate us about things that where okay in the time peroid that the story in this case was okay back then.     Most people these day take things way to serous now mostly because we have things like lawsuits and dercrimation. If someone can find something to complane about they will do so. if there is a book out there that is about back in the day when @CAPS1's had slave's and if there calling them a name that is not very nice. Then someone and complain and say that it is rashal and there will be a disbute about it and the auther will most likely loose and have to change that word into something els. People do not relise how much this happens it happens a lot expeshally with books.      Movies are a whole different thing now the things that happen on the movies get away with it mostly because they have money to get away with. There is a reason why things are @CAPS9 @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, and @CAPS4. @CAPS2 is for children under the age @NUM1. There are serten things that can be in though's movies. @CAPS2 @NUM1 there can be a lot more things it can be scarry to an extent and there also sometimes sexual things ,but they do not show the whole thing. There also can be villons and some swaring not a lot though. @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that's a whole new level they can have anything they really want and its a little more than @CAPS2 @NUM1 they kind of have a little more graphic than @CAPS2 @NUM1. Sometimes they have to choose between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @CAPS9 @CAPS4 it depends on how graphic things are.     Music is a whole other thing depending on what kind of music you are lissening to like theres @CAPS11, @CAPS4 & @CAPS13, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS17, and exedra. with all thoughs they talk about sex and volints. Now all of them excepent contry talk about drugs and @ORGANIZATION1 talks about @ORGANIZATION1. There are some that talks about more things, but most of them thats what they talk about. If perents do not want there childeren lissening to it then they do not lissen. there are ways of still lissening to it. most radio stations they can not swre on the radio, but they just cut it out. there are ways to have the uncut version, but thats on a @CAPS18, @CAPS19, or @CAPS20 @NUM7 player. There are ways to get around it.     See i think that it is dumb to take things like that away mostly, because they are going to see or hear about it someday anyways expeshally when they are in high school. Most teens do things with out there parents knowing and when they start driving they can lissen to whatever they want. Also they can read anything they want too, because they can buy the book and read it and hid it. Face it kids even younger find ways to do things that their parents do not want them to do. Matter what age they are they find ways to do what they want if they want it bad enoff. I think if a school wants to read something than they should have to have parents exent about it and if the kids can not read it than they can do something els insted or read something els. Do not take thing off the shelve just, because a couple of students can read or watch it. Your spoilling it for the kids that want to and can it is really unfair to the rest of the students they can not hepl it that there parents wont let them. If the parents won't then try to talk to them and tell them about it help them understand. Also people should have to watch what they do just because theres a kid the parent should leave them with a babysiter or something.",4,4,4,2
3733,2,"There are many kinds of books, music, movies, and magazines in one library. People all over the world have different interests in differtent subjects. Some people take offence to certain books, songs, movies, magazines, etc. Another person @MONTH1 not and think its offencive at all. For example, a religous book that talks about @CAPS1 being one guy when some people beleive differently. The book should not be put away, for there are also books that will be all about your beliefs.          The variety of subjects in a library such as songs, magazines and everything else in the library is huge. There should never be a book, movie, or item removed when one person takes offence to it because in Katherine Paterson quote, its makin the point if someone decides they want to remove a book from the shelf anyone could. Which eventually would leave people with no variety in books which would start a huge problem. People would not be able to read as much as they'd like because they would not have the ability to pick between many options. The library provides information for teachers, students, researchers, writers and for readers who do it as a hobby. If that was takin away from people, the people would become less informed about many things in the world.         In @CAPS2 freedom is important and we expect it, freedom of speech and the freedom to have your own opinions and interests. Therefor if items were being removed from a public place that gives that, @CAPS2 would not let this happen.

3736,2,"How much hurt can someone take from a book, popular music, a movie, or even a magazine, etc.? Well, as shown by studies, @CAPS1 ctizens @MONTH1 take what these items say more offensivley than what it @MONTH1 seem.  They @MONTH1 seem to go overboard or exaggerate what these updated articles are spreading across @LOCATION1, but is it really true?          Due to all the diffrent races @LOCATION1 sees every single day, sometimes we @MONTH1 @CAPS2 be doing our best to accept their diffrent cultural backrounds in our modern day society.  I have noticed just by going to a pretty much all white school how most people judge other races other than their own, wheather it be making fun of what they wear or how they talk, etc.  Sometimes I wish they could just consider that we are all human beings and no one deserves to be treated that way.  Taking this all into consideration, I think that wheather or @CAPS2 they are racial books, magazines, or movies they should @CAPS2 be removed from there distribution around the world.       I know that wheather or @CAPS2 that these books, movies, magazines, or music are racial they should still be able to be heard by those who want to hear it.  I think that there are some people out there, for example myself, who like to watch movies and read books about slavery, the holocaust, etc.  It's a part of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and I enjoy learning about it very much.  It @MONTH1 seem racial though to those who went through these hard times and these items which try to explain the pain these people went through @MONTH1 just seem like a joke towards them to make fun of all they went through, eventhough it is @CAPS2 meant that way at all.  I also understand that there are people who write books about mexican jokes, black jokes, etc. or even make comedy movies joking over diffent races.  These types of things I think should be taken OFF the shelves everywhere!  These are the types of things that I feel are what bother many different races and make fun of their cultural backround.       When it comes to music these days, it seems they always sing about love, being hurt physically and mentally, and so on.  I feel like music shouldn't really have an affect on diffrent races, unless it is purposley made for the reason of making fun of people.  I don't see where magazines can be harmful to a certain cultural backround.  The magazines I read about aka seventeen magazine seem to comment about how beautiful these people.     Overall, I think that making fun of diffrent races around the world is never going to get better if we never do anything to help it get better.  Eventhough all these diffrent items such as: movies, magazines, books and music @MONTH1 seem racial I think they should be left on the shelf of every library to let people watch and understand more about the @CAPS4 of our world, but if it is a truly written book, song, movie, or magazine article that is aimed to hurt someone of a diffent race, that should definatley be removed from every shelf around the world",4,3,4,2

3746,2,"In the current life we are all living we find a need to make things more an more private. If this something is said and we don't like it we find the urge to rid the @CAPS2 of to '@CAPS1' other people from it. In modern writing @DATE1 and all throughout history there have been certain books that we don't like because they go against what we find moraly right. But just because a group of people say it's wrong is there a need to completely abolish from the @LOCATION1?     No. When something is written it is written for a purpose. If there was no purpose then we wouldn't have anything to read at all in the first place. Yes, there are some books and magazine's that can be very vivid and unsutable for younger minds to experience. But that it is why these books are created for older people to read.      I am a large fan of books over the two @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that took place. I find them very fascinating and I love to see what my life could be like @DATE1 if the outcomes of those @CAPS3 would have been different. I will admit many of these books contain things that are very real in a sense that some adults even can't handle, but this would be no reason to get rid of them all together. These books signify a great part of human history that many people need to know. Without these books these @CAPS3 can become something in the past and nothing more.     There are also many books out there that have a large deal to do with very mature themes. These bookos can include very detailed areas about a sex scene. Yes indeed these books can definently be very unsutable for younger kids. But that is where the idea that these books were not created for them. They were created for older more mature readers. Also if we are so concerned as to what our children are seeing then that is where the parent would have to step in. The parent can control the limit in the intensity or maturity of the books their child is reading.     Looking out for what are children see is a large matter, the other side though is the thought of people getting ideas from reading more intense books. For instance when people find something that they truly believe in they can become very motivated to expand peoples knoledge of that matter. If one person reads a book about poloitics and see a side that they have never seen before they could become driven to form a group to drive that thought or matter into all of the minds of the human race. This could greatly affect us by having a large amount of people come to an uproar at a group even as large as our current governament. But even though this could happen what type of free, run by the people for the people, group are we now.     Overall putting restrictions on the things we read or see, to our country, would have to be moraly wrong. Limiting what are nation can see would lead to most likely more of an uproar than just having to deal with different thoughts or outlooks of a group of people. This could happen because people would see it as the government maybe making more socialist acts by trying to control our knoledge.",4,4,4,2
3750,2,"Should certain material found to be offensive be removed from the shelves of our library? Many people find material they see in libraries such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., to be offensive; but does that mean that they should be removed? I believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials. To censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities, destroy our profitable media, and be unconstitutional.      Parents are responsible for their children, not only when it comes to providing food and shelter, but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material. If you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows, texts, and music, do not let them see it. For instance, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their I-pod take it from them. It is not a right to have the device it is a privelage and parents are aloud to take away privelages.     In addition to neglecting the parent's responsibilities, it would be a gigantic blow to the media economically. Most media is viewed, because of the inappropriate material appearing in their shows, books, and music. If you censor all of that material out less movie tickets will be bought, less books will be sold, and less music will be listened to. In a time of recession, like the one we are currently coming out of it is more beneficial to provide as much income as possible, instead of destroying current oppurtunities for profit.      Both of these points are valid, but most importantly censoring libraries would be unconstitutional. In the preamble we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press. These offensive materials are included in this right. I understand admentments can be added to specify what type of speech and press is appropriate, but how will officers monitor that. Not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers.      In brief censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities, media economics, and our constitutional rights. When negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the benefits. Obviously censoring is not the answer to offensive material",4,5,4,2
3754,2,"No, I dont think you should be able to take the magazines off the shelf because it is pointless,to some people @MONTH1 find everything offensive and others @MONTH1 not find it offensive like me personally stuff people find offinsive I find it kind of humorous.       And I understand how some people are more likely to be offended because of say their sexuality or ethnicity. But other than that there should be no censorship it makes the place that is doing it seem like they are very strict and because of those strict policys it makes some people wanna go there less to get what they want and who knows the thing you @MONTH1 want @MONTH1 be censored.  And I understand that when you have a kid you dont want them to fo the wrong things in life and try and keep them away from the bad stuff as long as possible.  But as your child grows older he will be introduced to older/adult type material and you should cut them a break and not punish them very bad when something like that happens.  From my humble opinion some parents are very strict about censorship and I completely understand the parents point of view.     Eventually people will have to let their children find out about certain things, so you might as well allow them to see it at possibly the age of @NUM1 or so that seems like a suitable age for early privelages.  When it comes to taking items off a shelf some peole have worse judgement than other people and that can effect everyone from their bad judgement.",3,3,3,1
3756,2,"There are many books, types of music, movies, magazines, etc. that are found offensive to people. Should they be removed? It depends. If something is so inappropriate or offensive then it should be removed.      Today, there are many books that teach or give a bad message. If I see one, I just try ignore it; I do not pick it up and read the back or take it home and read it. I know what I am allowed and not allowed to read. But does that mean I should take it off the shelf and throw it away because I'm not allowed to read it? No. As much as I would like to, just to prevent others from reading it, I cannot. It is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place.     I think the area where the most offensive things are, are movies. There are so many movies now that have inappropriate scenes: bad language, scary scenes, etc. Some movies are not rated appropriately either. There is a movie out now that is rated @NUM1 and is extremely scary. I cannot imgaine watching this movie as a middle schooler; I watched it as a sophomore and was scared. I never would have though it would have been that bad because of its rating. Some movies for children even have inappropriate things; they might be hidden and the child not understand, but it is still there. Why does it need to be there in the first place? Is it that important? No.     Another area that is bad, are video games. There are kids who play them so much, all they think about is killing, guns, and war. There are kids who think of these things so much they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids. Some do it in a joking way, but others do not. These things are dangerous and hurt people-mentally and even emotionally.      You go to a grocery store or a gas station and see magazines with inappropriate things on them. No child should see those things, but if they are there anyone is going to look.     Different genres of music @MONTH1 even send bad messages. There are some radio stations that, with certain songs, bleep out words like drugs and alcohol, but with other songs that have curse words, keep them there. I do not really understand that. Yes, drugs and alcohol are bad, but why isn't a curse word? Just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad.       These types of things are very offensive to people. But is there really anything they can do? Not really. We all have our opinions and we can speak our minds, but sometimes we do not get want we always want. We cannot really do anything about this. Others belive it is okay to watch and listen and read these kinds of things, but with the things we read, watch, adn list to on a regular basis are what we think about. If you put bad things in your mind that is all you will begin to think about and it will become a part of your life",4,3,4,2
3757,2,"I belive that beople have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive, the reasone why i say this is because if one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that another person might think it is. If people think that a film from back in the late @NUM1's about the @ORGANIZATION1 that is used for educational perposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff. Just because some people think that a book with vulger language is offencive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds book have profanitey in them and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed form the shelfs in the library.     I have had my own incounters with books that i thought were offencive, there was a book that i was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of the @PERSON2 and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and they he had picked one for tonigh and were going to lynch them with the nuse they had made the night before and that really hurt me because I have some one in my famliy that is black and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart and I would probaly go out and find the people that did it and kill them.       In the quote that was writen by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost everybook we have has something volger in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left. If there was the posibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill form there, because there are people that can't go a day with out reading a part of there book and some people have devoted three hours to reading ounce a day.     What im trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have volger langage or something offencive in them because if we tryed to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything",3,3,3,1
3758,2,"The question is, should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive?  In my opinion I dont think they should censor the material.  Some things that we read, see, and hear are just going to be offensive, and we cant control everything that offends us.     I do agree that people have freedom of speech, but not over everything.  People need to stop over reacting to something that might have been said @DATE1.  Some things just need to be left in the past and kept there.  For example, some @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are still upset over slavery, and that happened over a @NUM1 @DATE1 @DATE1.   Censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our pass.      We need to stop all this over protection in our libraries of all places.  Children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future.  Why? Why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries.  Are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons?       My conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone.  I have been offended by lots of things that I have read but I dont try to get them censored or removed from the place I read it.  Sometimes you just have to deal with things that you dont like or dont agree with sometimes.",3,3,3,1
3761,2,"History is bond to repeat itself right? Well, we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future @LOCATION2. By censuring items on certain shelves is like when your mother makes you leave the kitchen so you don't get burned. This is just a way to protect the minds of young ones, which are like little sponges soaking everything they see or hear up.      The effects of what @MONTH1 come are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read. Making it so only certain material is available to young children and teenagers is a way to prevent the same racism, poverty, assinations, and religions protests of the past. The @ORGANIZATION1 prides itself on that children are the future, well, why not put in the effort to prevent the from seeing what the see or read?      I wish that when I was younger many people were trying to stop causes of such things as teen pregancy, drugs, alcohol, and abuse. But, there wasn't, there was a thirteen year old girl in my class who got pregant. She thought it was cool, because she read it in a book. This book she read wasn't hers it was her mothers and she left it on the table to take back to the library. Her mother forgot and @PERSON2 read that book. She told a bunch of friends and me about it. @PERSON2 said the book explained what guys wanted. She did that because of a made up story her mother checked out at a library.     This story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up. I have two younger sisters who already have to worry about being picked on; because of their clothes, their religion, the fact that they only listen to certain music. They should be able to go to school, and not worry about the book that they @MONTH1 grab at the library. My sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place,well, my brother is too. But, my point is they should have to live up to the expectations of others, or the what's cool.      By censuring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children. When they look at magazines or listen to music, they make discissions that could effect the rest of their lives. Just like how @ORGANIZATION2 has a new song out. The lyrics are inapporiate of many young children, but you can look it up on youtube. The lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding. These songs show us why children are having children, or doing drugs. It is all caused by what they see or hear around them.      Our country has hit an economical low, and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously. I think that if we could focus on the factors in hand, such as censuring we @MONTH1 accomplish something no one else has. To show the world @LOCATION2's youth is the future, and it is looking pretty bright. We each should take proud it making the children learn better, act better, and above all make their dreams come true.      If we have more students reading stuff such as, ' @LOCATION1, or To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' and enjoy them it would show that their dreams can come true fiction or non-fiction. It doesn't aways matter as long as your reading something that isn't stopping your mind to grow and develop fully.      Many of the young women in my sophmore class have read, ' the @CAPS3 series,' and they loved it which made them read other vamiper books. It shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrates who party all the time or go to jail. By looking at those magazines or reading books about those people teenagers think that everyone is doing it. To tell you the truth more people aren't doing it and have found other ways to stay occupied. We have say in whether or not the future is good or bad why not make the choice easier by elimating the ones we would choose for ourselves at the age of children picking up the books or reading the magazines; about @PERSON1 who just drove around with her baby on her lap. What choice are you choosing for you life?     In my personal oppion I believe children and adults should have separate televisions shows, magazines, and books. We want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way. These are the reasons as well as more to why censuring in libraries would help the impact of lies to children lessen. To add one final thing, would you tell everything you know to a five year old if you knew they would retain every word? I don't think I would want them to mature that fast, otherwise what is the point of life, or school. To go and learn what you already know",4,4,4,2
3762,2,"I think censorship  should be allowed and the libraries because many people have diffrent oppions of what type of books they like and should read.I don't think people should remove books or any type of materials just because of hte dislike.Many people think by looking a diffrent types of  materials can have you look for the right imformation.I feel that if you limit the books and libraries that whould be less resources to help out with the imformation that you are trying to recieve.Many people find it hard if the imformation they are wonted is not there and the local libraries. Libraries should a be able to find all the books, music, movies and magazines they wont and need.Books should never be tooking of the self but only should be allowed more on the shelves for any imformation that are needed",2,2,2,0
3763,2,"Books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity. Taking certain books off the shelves @MONTH1 have a negative effect on people. Certain books, music, movies, and magazines are not always as bad as what some people think. People have different views on what is good and bad, so you cannot really remove certain books because, like Katherine Paterson said, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We need to leave every book on the shelves. Using my own observations, reading, and my own experience I will prove to you that we need those books on our shelves.     First, I watch younger children getting so many books off the shelves and maybe they aren't the best for them. I believe from watching them, that it helps them grow. Being a young kid you're curious and they need to be able to look at just about anything. Honestly, if it's really that bad to you they won't remember it the next day. Personally I think that them seeing what we call 'bad things' will make them not want to look again, and help them learn right from wrong.      Secondly, I have seen many magazines, read many books, and watched many movies that I probably shouldn't have. I feel from seeing and reading those things it has made me a better person not to do the 'bad things' that they are doing. I've read books about slavery, and war and it just wants me to make the world a better place. Knowing that younger children than I are reading and seeing all this negativity in this world doesn't always put me in the spot to say 'keep everything on the shelves,' but I also believe children will know between right and wrong.     Lastly, I have experienced children and young adults abusing the library and getting movies they shouldn't be watching, which would make many people want to take certain books off the shelves. Certain books need to be kept away from young kids, but not from everyone.We older, and more wiser adults need to realize that it's not all bad, yes bad for our young ones but maybe not for someone else. A family member of mine is a photographer and he looks at nude magazines and movies to help him with his career. Not every nude movie and magazine is abused, and everyone should realize this.     All in all, I understand of removing some books, magazines, and movies but we can't. I don't believe a certain book is offensive to everyone, just certain people. Different people need books and movies for different things, and they aren't all used for bad. We need to all come together as one to keep certain books out of young peoples' reach, so that the books and movies aren't abused. Hopefully, everyone keeps every book on the shelves. Again, as Katherine Paterson stated, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' if we remove them",4,4,4,2
3768,2,"In this persuation essay it will talk about the content of should we or shouldn't we remove all offensive books, music, movies, magazines of the shelf. In this essay everyone will agree with the content or be in the opposing side of the aurgument. In this essay it isn't the exception that this essay will disagree with some of the viewing audience; however, there are situations in which the audience can go with both sides.      To begin with, in the matter of the case should we or should we not remove offensive books,music, magazines, or movies from the library. I don't believe that all content should be remove for all to see. In some cases there are the exception, but in banding all material doesn't seem logic. In my point of view the removal of materials seems a little extreme; however putting the content in a higher shelf seems more pratical instead of removal all for good. Yes, it might be offensive but in this time period offensive movies, books, magazines, books, and so on are look as more comedial and not taken serious. For example, a really offensive show called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is a really offensive and people just see it as entertaining. This show can be offensive to everyone, but yet we still see it. In this show there is warning label stating only be seen to children @NUM1 and older. Parents are advice and to be acknowledge what their kids are seeing. It's not the creator of the content to be banned, yet it is the job as a parent to be mindful in what their kids are reading, watching, looking, or listening not them. In which case there there isn't away to be right in this subject. However the creators of the conent see it as a way to vent over their lifes, experiences, and what opticals they had to faceor just to make people laugh. They see it as a safe way to espress themselves. It might be offensive to you, but for some people that's there life. You might not like it or it @MONTH1 seem harsh for you, but that's real life.      Secondly there are always something that @MONTH1 offend you, but it doesn't seem logical to banned it. An example might be religion. A religion a person might be it might offend you. It doesn't mean if the religion offensive that it will get banned or be remove for everyone. Your religion @MONTH1 offend someone, but they deal with it and embrace the differnces. If your friends has a different religion it doesn't mean you will never talk to them ever again.      Thirdly, you might express yourself and there are going to be people out there that won't agree with you. You might create a book, a song, or a movie that will offend someone in a way. For example, the @CAPS3 series is offensive to some guys and girls. A disagrrement between two girls fighting over which charater is better for @CAPS4. There are always an opposing side. A @CAPS2 might be tried of hearing about @CAPS5 all of time and might find offensive when a girl @MONTH1 compare him to @CAPS6 or @PERSON1. Saying why can't boys be like them, but even then they don't remove @CAPS3 all together. For you it might seem the greatest movie ever, or the most terrible movie in the universe.      Fourthly, another example is a @CAPS8 show called, '@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12' (queen of the south) where a women that had nothing to begin with, yet ended up being the most wanted in some countries. Some people @MONTH1 seem that it might be cool to be just like her. It doesn't seem that people will go uot there and do what she does cause in the television show shows all of the consequences there are if you do what she did. This show is an example of what could happen if you become exactly like her. Some offensive material @MONTH1 teach a lesson and can pervent a person to do something that they @MONTH1 later regreat.     In conclusion, everything in our life offends us in some way. It doesn't matter what it is we deal with it and our life goes on. There is no way to see this, but one thing you enjoy maybe be offensive to others. It wouldn't seem fair to take something you enjoy just because it offended one person. So I belive that the libaries censorship isn't at risk. In my opinion everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or even listen to. And also have the choice to stop reading it, watching it, or listening to it",4,4,4,2
3790,2,"I don't think they should publically exploit the books if certain people feel offended by it, but I personally do not get offended by anything so my opinion will be different than others. However, if the library recieves constant complaints about this issue then I could see why they would want to get rid of it.      So what i'm saying is that if it doesn't cause a problem for anyone other then a select few then I believe they should keep it but just let the offended know that the book  is going to be out of sight, therefore making the issue non-existant.      I don't think that librarians will intentually put out books that offend the public people on display in front of everyone to see, I believe that they just have the books for their purpose and that's to be read. I've been to the public library many times and out of all the times i've been I dont think i have seen a single thing that has offended me or made me un-comfortable.      The books are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge, without them I believe it would hurt our nation as a whole, due to the fact that we need knowledge to do things and the more knowledge we have the better our lives will be. So no, I believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem.",3,3,3,1
3792,2,"I believe that if something is found offense to someone then it dosent mean its offense to someone else. In libraries there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc, some of these different type of things @MONTH1 come across as offesnse to some but others @MONTH1 enjoy it. Therefore it shouldnt be taken away from those who enjoy reading or listening to these things.          Some things such as adult novels and explict music are things people consider to be offensive. But what they dont understand is that some people actually enjoy listening or reading this material so taking it away from them is not right. Everyone should be able to have different likes in these areas. Everyone is not the same.     If you attend a library you should be able to find something that fits your style or sparks your intrest. If the things that people like are being taken away then its not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing. Its more likely closing them out on things they like because other people dont like it or find it offensive.     Lastly, those that think that these things are offensive are entitled to there opinion. But so are those that believe that these things are good. There should remain a variety of different books, music, and other things that appeal to all types of personalities.     Everyone has a right to say weither they dont like something. But what you dont like someone else does. So to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust.",3,3,3,1
3798,2,"How would you feel if your son or daughter saw a naked picture of someone, kept hearing bad words from a song that was in the library! Would you really want that for your child? Thought a library was supposed to be a learning center, didnt know it was a bad place to be. People have their own opinions in everything! A lot of things these days are changing and it's not for the better! Television, books, and music are becoming dirty and unenjoyable to people. Please help try and help us stop this! We don't want it getting to our kids, like it has to others!     Some people like these kinds of things with bad actions in them! One thing that catches them is the beat, it just makes them want to start dancing. Another reason why they like it is beacuse their friends like it also! People these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be. When people grow up they usually have an idol whether its a singer, book writer, or actor. When that idol grows older it most likely isnt going to be the same person with the same thoughts it had @DATE1, they change for the worse most of the time! They get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in. When that happens people loose than interste in them unless they think its cool! It all just depends on the person! Some people thrive off of these things!     Libraries are supposed to be for all ages! If a kid finds something that was bad at a library and tells their friends or parents thats just putting down the library and they aren't going to want to go there anymore. This is just hurting the library because it will loose a lot of their buisness. Young kids these days are being expossed to a lot of more things that they should'nt be! What little kids already know is sickning! Hearing them say that they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they know bad words just at the age of @DATE1! It might have to do with the parents or the friends the kids choose but in my opinion it's right! Kid's are growing up way to fast because of the things that they know!     Movies, music, books, etc. are not like they used to be in the fifty's, even the eighty's, yeah they werent the best, but its gotten a little extreme theses days. The words that they say in songs, the things we see in movies, and the picture we see in magazines are getting out of hand. There should be a section that is blocked off only for eighteen and older that has all the bad things in the music, movies, and, magazine articles/picture. People shoud have id's that they have to have to get into this section! This is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age. This might not even work, but its worth a try!      The world is'nt a happy place anymore! It's filled with violence, sex, drugs, etc. Some parents don't care about the things that their child does, says, or sees. It all just depends on the family. Whether they believe in @CAPS1 or if they don't is another example of this! It always affects ther actions and thought! People try and do the littlest things, and they try and make a difference in the world. That is what people need to do, not get involved in horrible things. They need to get involved and stay out of these bad things; seeing bad picture, hearing bad words, and watching horrible things in movies. Try to make a difference! dont be a follower because it's not going ti get you anywhere in life! Everything counts!",4,4,4,2
3802,2,"How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. Everyone in this world is different from the next person. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others.     For my first reason goes along with personal values. For example a person of higher authority @MONTH1 find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics.      My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. Everyone likes different things and has different views. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person.     People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others.     Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develope a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present.",4,4,4,2

I feel that since everyone has their own definition of offensive and disturbing, that libraries and media centers should separate such materials from other books, magazines or @CAPS1.      My opinion is that not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive. It depends on that person's background, religion and personal beliefs. I do not that think books, magazines or @CAPS1 shoulds have to be banned from library shelves just because that particular person finds that peice of material offensive. If they find it so disturbing then they should discontinue reading that book or magazine, or listening to that @CAPS3.       One person should not be able to make the choice of keeping a certain book or magazine on the shelf because somewhere out there, I'm sure there is someone who does not find it offensive. The partial point of writing a book or song is to express one's opinion of a topic and if the reader or listener does not approve of their opinion, then they should respect that director or author's thoughts and move on. If a library or media center contains inapropriate books, magazines or moviees, they should create special areas or shelves to keep such material. This area could be created for adult or mature readers, viewers or listeners. I also think that books and other peices of media of such inapropriateness should have a label regarding its offensive or explicit content.     If someone finds a song, book, or magazine article offensive or disturbing; I do not think that a single person has the right to have it removed from the public and that there are other ways to keep such material out of a reader or listener's hand, that @MONTH1 not know about its possible offensiveness. If warning signs are shown, then the reader or listener should realize that they are taking the risk of being offended or disturbed. If such measures are taken, I think they will keep all readers, viewers and listeners pleased.",3,4,3,1
3810,2,"I think that libraries should not remove material such as book, music, movies, magazines. I think that libraries should keep them because thier are alot of people tht has thier own stlye at reading. Sometimes i will go to the librarie and get a book, then i will go look at magazines, movies, music. Thier are alot of movies out right now, and now u can go cheak them out. Music is the same way. I feel like if thier stuff in the librarie that kids like they should go for it. Im sure that they have edgucational books, movies and magazines.                                                                                  If  people take out stuff that kids and teens like. Some of them might not return back.Thier are alot of students that listen to music and watch movies too. I love cheaking out movies from the libraries its easy and they always have the movies that u are lookin for. The movies are easy to find. and its quick. If the music has some offfensive stuff in it that they should take it off the shelves because it will have peopel thinkin why would they put a movie, music, magazines and book up on the shelves if they know it is offensive to the public.                                                          Inconclusion i hope the people at the libraries take the offensive stuff off the shelves.It would bring move people in and they would have more respect for thoes people. The public would`t have to worrie about picking up a book that has alot of stuff that thier kids do not need to see, read, or listen. That goes for movies, music, magazines, books and more. I really hope the people make the right choice",3,3,3,1
3813,2,"Should we remove offensive items or materials from a public library? My belief is no because many people in today's society are pretty offensive themselves and the books are meant to show the life of fiction or fact and when you do censor something the other person will try his or her best to try and find an uncensored version of the same material.      Art books are another thing that should not be censored because the artist is not trying to be perverse or offensive he or she is just trying to show his vision of art in the form he or she feels people would find artistic.  Censorship is important in some ways but you also have to have an opened mind because someone who finds something offensive might not feel that way later on in their life.      So my belief is don't censor something because it might offend some, because there are many who probably don't take offense to it be it books,music,videos,video games,writing,or movies.      We are all going to have a democracy over if something should or shouldn't be appropriate.     So what are your thoughts censor a book because of it's content or leave it and let the people decide?      My thoughts would be censorship is moral but you also have to think it would be immoral to take a book away from a reader that might find this book interesting.      So please don't censor books from our public library, we need books that have facts or fiction in them but also have a great story in it's words.          My other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended.",2,3,2,0
3814,2,I think that that if there is a book in the libraries that is hurmful. Then you should  have to be at least @NUM1 years of age to check it out. The reason why i say @NUM1 is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong AND you can handle it if is wrong. I mean if you know its wrong then dont read it no one is maken you read it.     It would be differnt if some one waz but no one is.Some people like to read differnt kinds of books just because its not right and hurts you dont mean it hurts ever one it @MONTH1 make it helpfull to some one esle and if its tgaken out then there wont be any books in the libraries for anyone to check out and read. BECAUSE ever book in there is going to hurt some if u made them read it.     If you have have a problem with that you can contact me at @NUM3 ask for @PERSON1 and we can talk bout it and mabe you @MONTH1 be about to change my mind or after you read this you make think the same way as i do.      The reason i feel thinks way is because like i said before there is a part in ever book that will hurt some one so you should have to be @NUM1 to check out surten books.If ur getting hurt by a bunch of books then i would sugest you to stop readen because a book is a book not somthing to hurt you.There is so many people in the world that is into books and resourcen bout stuff.     What i do not agree with is that kids getting out of class going to the library playing games and putting puzzels togther that is the problem  i got.I mean yeah people do go in there and do work witch is find BUT some say that they have work and they dont.They just want to get out of class and not do work. People go in there and play games and when people need on the cumputer there is no were to go because of kids playing games.          But as the book part in the library i dont have a problem with that  thats what i got to say bout books hurting people is dont read them other people  like them being there for them.,3,3,3,1
3817,2,"Dear editor,     I feel that we should not take any movies, books, and music off the self. I mean realy it will start confliced.Then we have law suight.     I have seen what happens when you take a book off the self. the people start yelling because they did not find it offending. Then they say that they are going to suw. Last it costs mouney to go to corght.     I have also seen what happens when u take music off the self. people yell at first. Then they start to get vilent. Know you have a mob of people destoyinh your store because you took down some music.     This is why we need to keep them all up. You can take this any way  that you want but i hope you learn before it is to late. I hope that you will put this in the peaper thank you.

3819,2,"The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that poeple wish that there kids or even there on self did not read or that people wish they did not read. But if your were to take away ever book someone found offensive there would be hardly any books left in this world. There will always be one person that finds a book that they do not like because of tone the author uses or if they do not like what they call eachother. People all have there own mind sit to away that they want to live or how they want there kids to live.      Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves. I feel like if there books on the shelves about kids drinking then have bad effects on there life cause they did drink then maybe the kid reading it would stop drinking or not even try drinking. The books about getting raped and them not telling becasue they are afriad of what would happening. Then in the long run telling after they get pregant or injured from it. Them saying that they wish they would have told might help the kids that this happened to or this might happen to might help them feel so relief and tell someone and save themself. Books like these should not get taken off the shelf because one person does not like it, in the long run if they did take it off some could get hurt or not know what to do and it couls be all that one person that did not like it fault. How would you feel if you did that to someone. Maryrin @CAPS1 is a good Author that shows how something that you @MONTH1 think is good but truns out to be really bad. Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe.     I have a friend that have parents that do not like the music on her ipod. So she had to take it off. Well with taking it off she made @CAPS2 of the songs that they did not like. She drives so they music is always playing on the radio while she drives so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her ipod. That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear. Music will always be out there. There will always be songs that poeple do not like. Either due to there religion or even if they do not like the words used. But even if they stop putting songs on the radio there is still internet out there and people can just get there songs from there.     There are songs out there that should not be out there but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people listening to them the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them. In the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same. Artics now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song. That is just how the songs go. That is just how they use there brains. No one can stop them. Not even the people that publish the songs and put then on the radio.      In the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them. It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio. People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone. A kid @MONTH1 grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it. But when they read a book about a kid there age getting kidnapped they @MONTH1 understand more clearly on the whys in life.      So if I can say so myself I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that book is not good for thier little girl or there teenage son. They need to read it for themself and find out what really could happen if they did something like that. Keep the books on the self. Keep playing the some music. Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on there own rather then you just keep telling them. I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it then having my parents tell me over and over agian. So keep the books on the shelves. That the radio play. Just be safe in doing it.",4,4,4,2
3821,2,"Everybody is in tittle of making their own desicion. If that includes not letting their own children look at certain books then that's okay, but that doesn't mean they have to make that desicion for everyone. Everyone has their own opinion of certain books that might be less modest than others that just how it is, but to take the book out of the libraries is not taking in consideration of others.     If there are some books that are offense to a certain type of ethnicty or religion ect. then just ignore it and go on. There is no reason to take those kinds of books out, for what we all know that certain book might be used for research and that person that needs. Taking out certain books of the library are depriving the youth from contemporary literature that is going to be very imporant for the future. The @CAPS1 is a good example, in the time it got published many people wanted to get rid of the book because it was not traditional, that book is now being used in our class room and is teaching us many literary techniques. There are countless books just like The @CAPS1 that are being taked out of libraries now and that could be deeply appreciated by the future writers.     Katherine Paterson has the prospective of many authors, taking out books that are offensive to people is going to cause us to have no books. For hard working writers it is unfair to work so hard and have the book band from the libraries because a certain group of parents didn't find it approving. If they don't approve of the book then tell the child not to get it. A library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted. The library is a place of discovery not a place of restriction.",3,3,3,1
3824,2,"Censorship on Libraries.     Do you ever walk into a library, walk up to one of those gigantic, cluttered book shelves and pick up a book that looks promising, and worth reading? Well, what happens if you go to read the summary of this unfathomably great book, and you just feel...alienated, by the style that this book is written? Do you ever want to take that book off the shelf? Well, I do. But,  if everyone takes a book off of a shelf that they are  uncomfortable with, there would be a miniscule amount, if any books to read at all. Books based on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people.     When you go to the various sections of your local library, what section do you start sprinting towards? The adult section has tons of different genres of books, but what do you do when you find one about @CAPS4? If you are a person of a certain faith, and you find a book that is making fun of your faith what do you do then? Nothing, because there is freedom of speech. You @MONTH1 be uncomfortable about that book being sold in countries all over the world, but what if someone feels that same way about your favorite book. This is a topic people have been 'debating' for years.      Suppose you glide on over to an alienated shelf. This very colorful book is just screaming for your attention?  You pick up the book and come to find, it is talking about @CAPS2. That could make anyone feel uncomfortable. I personally do not agree with making fun of poeple in this way. Poeple are made to look different for a purpose, not to humiliate them but so not all of us look the same, and we can be our own person.      What would you do if you picked up a book, where someone is being teased about their looks, and @CAPS3? Sure one joke can make everyone love you, but when one person is not very fond of you, well that speaks a thousand words. Different genres of characteristics include; being bigger or smaller, taller or shorter, having brown, blonde or red hair. Millions of people are critised and teased relentlessly becuase they look just a little bit different. Everyone has been teased once in their life. It is not very funny to the person being teased.      Books based on @CAPS4, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people. I have written you this letter to tell you that I do not support some of the books on the market or the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11, but if everyone felt this way there would be no books. So I do not think we should take the books off of the shelves. We just need to embrace the fact that everyone is different, and that is not a joke. Where would the world be today, if we believed the same way we did years ago about these very topics? Do not take the books off the shelf, maybe one day it will signify what the world used to be",4,4,4,2
3827,2,"A library is a place to rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home. Some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to check out books, musical materials, movies, etc. @CAPS1 isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people. If people don't want to see material that will offend them then they shouldn't go to the are in the library that contains the offensive materials.      In my own personal opinion, @CAPS1 doesn't really apply to me if there is offensive material in the library. If there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent @CAPS1 or read @CAPS1. Not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials. If someone that is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be aloud to have them.     Another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library. Instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials. The library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material, so that people nor children have to see them.      Also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them. They don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things. If a child wants to do something badly enough then they will find a way to do @CAPS1, or in this case the child will see something that they want to see.        If parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials, if they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials. A library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satify parents.      If the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business. So in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents. Libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials. So parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library. Offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries, these kind of materials should just have rules.",4,4,4,2
3828,2,"To begin with, a woman might read a book about wifes and find it offense. But it was her choice to pick up the book and read it. Should it be taken off the shelf? No why should it. Different people have different perpectives on what they're reading. Not all people feel the same way. Samething goes for music, movies, magazines, etc. They might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it. It was there choice to pick it up and read it. No one held a gun to there head and said 'read the book etc.'      @CAPS1, why should a book, etc., be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it? You still have the rest of the population who might love it, some might just like it, and the ones who don't. You can't just think about that one person you have to consider everybody esle. If that person finds that book, etc., offensive then they should have chosen wisely the first time and/or never should have chose what they did. It's there own fault.     For my conclusion, nothing should be taken off  the shelf if its offensive just don't read the book and etc. Another person might read it and like it. Some people who finds things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way. Keep the book etc., on the shelf if they take it off then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive. Then what we will be able to read or listen too",3,3,3,1
3830,2,"Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindeling? Censorship is taking away our freedom to experince to read or listen to what we want, who has the right to tell us what we can watch, read or even listen to?     As an avid reader of all kinds of literature i cant stand censorship. Kids today need to be able to read what they want, to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life. The so called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read, as @CAPS1 we should be able to read what we want, wether it is offensive or not.     If you want to put certain restictions on a book such as a age limit i can understad that, but to completely take them off the shelves then we are losing our greatest right as an @CAPS2 citisen. To read and watch or listen other media is a great way to learn about things other than what is in our back yard.     Music and television i understand some censorship, i dont want my little brother or any younger youth hearing the '@CAPS3 bomb' or seeing anythin obsene, but these days its getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media.      Many kids today have access to the enternet which can be good and bad. If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to but certain blocks on their computer. Kisd these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the enternet and @CAPS4, but a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible weather it be fiction, classics such as 'The @CAPS5 snd The @CAPS6', or educational litterature.     So is our reading choices becoming scarese? Yes i believe so, na it all has to do with censorship. We cant read some of the classics because the're 'racist' or are 'pornagraphic', but you have to understand for the time they were written the weren't. so let everyone read what they want when they want.",4,4,4,2

I, myself personally feel that this book should be removed from the selves because for the simple fact it is over-rated and contains lots of violence and sex.      A while back when I was in the seventh grade, I read this book called,'@CAPS1'. I was a good book but it was also very explesive. The book was mainly about this teen who had a rough childhood and was trying to make it through high school while being engaged in a abusive relationship, peer pressure, and a adiction to sex and drug.      This book was exposing and very detailed, In which I strongly disagree with other children reading this book.  I feel sex and violence shouldn't displayed in books or any other type of media.      Inconclusion, I believe that certain materials such as books should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive. Books that display lots of sex and violence should be restricted and not able to leave the selves of libary unless their issued to someone eighteen or older",3,3,3,1

There are many people who thribe off of the horrable thing people put out in to the world. They love to pain of others. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves, there should be a age limmit to what sertan age groupes should read. Yees there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that lyes with the parents.           If there was a age limmit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem.As well we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book.      if we  had all of this then there would not be any more problems. it would be a nice controled libaray. so in conclustion this is the way to go. this is the futur of tommorw",3,3,3,1

Its believing in your decesion or choice you have made. If I were to reflect my views on censorship in libraries, we all would have that same oppurtunity to state our opinion about what we feel should not be included. There could be unappropriate books in the library that we absolutly would not want our younger group of siblings reading. The best thing is to ask ourselves, Should we have the right to take our kids freedom an right to read, listen to, updated media and publications from them when we had it? Should we put a censorship on the libraries really?     I feel that censoring a library would not be nessarry considering a library is a manual guide of history. Our libraries or organized from A to @CAPS1  in authors names, seperated from non fiction an fiction, cd's seperated in one section, movies one section, magazines, and adult books from children book seperated in diffrent sections. Libraries all across the world has had a kid that might have choose a book that was not appropriate for them to read but what kid hasn't. What would a book hurt them if theres plenty of  bad influces, peer presure, violence, and sexually publicity everywhere and @PERCENT1 in the media. It would not be fair at all for us to rob our kids of the chance to read and learn from books.     I feel no we should not take our learning form our babies. Growing up as a kid I loved being able to go to the library it helped to enhance my vocabulary, spelling and which I learned plenty new words. Books I read growing up wasn't perfectly @NUM1 but I could relate to alot of books I choose as a kid so no I feel we should not censor libraies we need them to be a fun place to our children and us to go to for learning, fun, confort and etc. We can't take that from our generation it just would not be right.",4,3,4,2
3849,2,"Having offensive books and movies in a library shouldn't be allowed. If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive, more than likely someone else will find it offensive too. So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, will reduce problems before they even happen. Now, more then ever, you will find offensive things in libraries. More people get offended by lesser things now.         One reason to have a censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derrogitory writings and movies? I would be very upset if my child had to see that. It's teaching them different values and it's teaching them that since it's in a library it must be okay to do out in the community. For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, they're going to look up to that and more then likely do those things, which they could end up harming themselves or others.     If the goverment provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our goverment doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves? It gives them a bad name. If we look to our goverment for support and answers. How would we feel if they had no judgement about the offensive things in libraries? It would seem like they didn't care and that might cause panic throughout the country.Which would cause many more problems then needed. It would be a easier thing just to censor our libraries.     If our libraries weren't consumed with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value. We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something. Rather than, lead them into making bad decisions. There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it. Not just the library has books. You could find one quite easily if you tried. If a library does have offensive things,  I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for.     When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex postitions.' I highly disagree and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read. So by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will calm down some of the problems that are re-occuring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely.",4,4,4,2

There should be censorship in libraries.I feel that it should be censorship because they already have stores that contain certain things that kids aren't able to buy.One other reason that i feel that it should be censorship is because children will probably read something and take it the wromg way.When you are a kid and you know that there is something that you know for sure you shouldnt be reading or watching,you try your best to sneak and read or watch whatever it @MONTH1 be.Thats why if we had censorship,they wouldnt have a chane to do so.Another reason i say we should have censorship is because libraries are public, and if you have to be a certain age to look at or view something then you should nt have it in the library.     As you can see,these are the reasons that i feel we should have censorship in libraries.With censorship nobody will feel left out and everyone will be treated equally and feel the same.They already have book stores and online site, where u can buy books and movies,and they have no censorship u just have to be a certain age and have a credit card.That way, they are for sure it is okay for you to rent things from them because you have to be a certain age to have a credit card.So with that being said,I feel there should be censorship in libraries.",3,3,3,1
3856,2,"The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want. Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information. People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it.      Sometimes there might be inapropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesnt apply to you it might to someome else, for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you dont think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it.        Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs. Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how there bad for you and that you shouldnt do them. I know I ike reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I dont want to live like that.     There are some things I dont think should be allowed like books, magizines, music, and movies about racialism. I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because there skin is a different color, they have just as much right to be here as we do. Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not there fault there like that and its just inapropriate.   Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others  and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we @MONTH1 complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives. And if there are inapropriate things at the library you dont like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go.",4,4,4,2
3860,2,"Don't you hate when you come across a book that you wish was never written? I'm sure we all come to that point in our lives, constant readers, or not. Like a qoute i once read, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have exactly the same right and so does everone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                         - Katherine Paterson, Author     If you ask me, I think there should be a certain autority to these books. Maybe if we could make a petition and have at least @NUM1 people sign it then the book could be removed. All of this goes for music, movies, magazines, even bibles in librarys.      I'm not saying we should make a law that says if one person dosen't like something then no body should have the right to have it. But as a public if enough people all agree we shouldn't have something then maybe its best that we dont. We all worry about our children, having to keep a constant eye on them making sure there not getting into something there not supposed to be in. Same goes with books and movies, even music and magazines nowadays, and for certain people, even bibles.     Now dont get me wrong, I'm sure we all know that when a child goes to a library and trys to check out an 'inapropriate' book then the checkout counter will deny the child and take the book. But just think for a minute here, That doesnt meen the child cant go into the library find a book and just read it there. Theres also the senario where, mind me it @MONTH1 not be your child but with todays crime records then this is very probable, the child could grab a book, magazine, even a film and just steal it.     In the long run there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening. There could be an adult section of the library, not just for '@CAPS1' rated books or films but just a place where we can keep all the books we dont think children should be reading. Still we should definately have the option to petition off books we don't think our children should be reading. Think what you will but this is my opinion of library censorship, hopefully its yours now too.",3,3,3,1
3862,2,"Libraries are a place for everyone; from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages. When you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it. From personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right? Well some libraries want to take that concept away.      A library has books on nearly all subjects. That is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library. Someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion. If a strict @CAPS1 would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended. That situation could go both ways though. Because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature.      Most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections. There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault. The mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area.          With different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things. Some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. One book to one person could mean something totally different to another. It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. Libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area.      Books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people. Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book. Whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs. With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? Taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives.      A library is a place of knowlegde. It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. Wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech? Just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. If people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom?       A library is a place for everyone. It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. A libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books. Taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. A library should be a place of balance. A place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read",5,4,5,3
3865,2,"Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience @CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson.     In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life. After helping her find the @CAPS2, she ask, '@CAPS5 is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about.     It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunatley, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?",4,4,4,2
3866,2,"I feel that a library can have any kind of book stating any kind of material. Its a library, a place where people go to get information.      If you dont want your kid, or kids reading, watching, or listening to those kinds of material then you shouldn't have to let them read, listen to or watch any offensive material, untill they are at a certain age and are mature enough about it. It is a library, and they are gonna have a wide variety of books. I dont think any book should be removed just because someone gets offended or its to ghory or has to many curse words for your kid.          Not everyone gets offended by the same things, or the same material. If you do then dont read that book or watch that movie, but that shouldn't mean it has to be taken off the shelf just because one person got offended by it. Libraries are made for the community and the people in it, not just one person. Other people might want to read or watch the material that some people get offended by.      This is what I think on the censorship on the book, movies, music, magazine, etc. Its a library, they are going to have a bunch of material. If you find something offensive, be mature, put it back and find something else to read, watch or listen to",4,4,4,2
3869,2,"I believe that it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for offensive reasons. I feel this way for several reasons, but three in particular. First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make.     First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. People come to libraries to look at what they're interested in to entertain themselves. @CAPS1 should be all types of literation in the library for all types of people, because everyone doesn't think alike. Everytime an item is removed off of a shelf, @CAPS1 will be an unsatisfied customer.     Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Libraries always have some type of organization. In order to not offend anyone, items should be divided into their own categories inside their own sections. This solution will prevent anyone from seeing something that offends them. If that doesn't help, librarians should post a sign stating what type of objects are inside on the front door, so everyone knows before they enter.    Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. A customers' needs and wants should be met at all times, unless a customer is trying to run the business as if it was their own. If a particular library chooses to have certain types of items, because they know what what readers' like, then no one else should involve theirself. If I owned a library, I would be upset if a customer removed a book off a shelf, because they would be interfering with my business.     In conclusion, I beleve it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for three reasons. First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading. Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. I believe I expressed my opinion to the fullest. Although some people @MONTH1 disagree with the way I feel, I'm sticking with it. @CAPS1 defintly wouldn't be any books left for any of us if items were removed for offensive reasons.",3,4,3,1
3870,2,"Newpaper company,@CAPS1 am writing to this company on why I think the certain books, music, movies and magazine should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive. @CAPS1 wirting to tell you from my own experience and readings that will convince a argument. @CAPS1 reflecting my view on censorship in libraries. @CAPS1 writing so you can hear me out on what I have to say and persuasive you on this essay.     First, I think know book should be taking off on any shelf of any library. Rather if it was to do with people thoughts on religious, race or any other thing that has been offensive to anyone in the past. For example, gay and lesbian marriage peoples thoughts and opinion on this topic. I beileve that know one should disrespect anyone opinion on what they have to say. It depends on what kind of language your using for this type of subject if its has harsh words and its suppose to be harmful, then yes it should be remove. Another thing is children taken books off shelves. Maybe you should ascort your child in the child section and telling him or her what they should not do like taking stuff down that they are not suppose to. What I'm saying is if suppose to hurt other and is offensive using negatively words to harm others feelings, it should be remove.      My letter to you was to show you on my opinion on what I think should be in a library or not. I have use some examples and common sense to show you my point of view on what I think is right or wrong in this situation. I hope my topics and argurment has convince you on if you should remove a book from a shelf.                                             @ORGANIZATION1",3,3,3,1
3874,2,"Almost everyone in this world reads. Many people have to read almost every day, people @MONTH1 not realize it but they do. Reading is just a part of life If you dont know how to read you are most likely to not be sucessful. Even if you know how to read a little bit, if you just the knew the basic words people would probally fine but people deffinatly need to know how to read. No, I do not think they should take anything off the shelf.     Why would they take anything off the shelf? If anyone finds it offensive they should simally not read it. Just because it offends them other people @MONTH1 find it interesting. If peolpe just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them, who knows how many books we would have left. people can  be offended in the most easiest ways. We could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in a way.The same thing with moives, moives can offende people justr the same as books. I think moives would offend more than a book would.     In conclusion, Books, movies or anything of that matter should not be took off the shelf because it offended someone. Many people get offended in this word way to easy. One person @MONTH1 love a book and another person hate it. Just because you hate it does not mean it should be tooken off the shelfs",3,3,3,1
3875,2,"Censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today.  Many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society, and should not be tolerated.  Others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression.  The issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children.  Are there materials that are acceptable for adults, but not kids?  Questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution.       Today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word.  In fact, there is nothin inherently wrong with the concept of censorship.  It is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise.  For example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of '@PERSON2,' the book that @PERSON1 wrote as a sort of mission statement for @LOCATION1.  While many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored.  People have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on @PERSON1's teachings, it is not the government's place to decide for them.  While oppressive dictatorship and mass-murder are crimes, reading about them is not.     There are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands.  If someone understands what they are reading, and are able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge, or expressing themself by creating similar material.  However, the issue changes completely when one considers children.  If adults want to view pornography, or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business.  However, those concepts are obviously inappropriate for children, and any decent parent wouldn't want their young kids filling their heads with such things.  Children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them.  In the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development.       When it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned.  If libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain.  However, that does not mean there should not be any limitations.  Libraries should offer a children's section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters.  Then, it becomes the parents' responsibilty to ensure that their child stays in that section.  When a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section, they are free to take their kid there.  This system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material, without taking it out of the hands of adults.  Many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library.  After all, it's better that a few kids see something they shouldn't have than all adults have to read censored material.       In conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society, but must be used very carefully.  When the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly.  However, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression.  Above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves.  If someone doesn't like a piece of material, they can leave it alone, but they should never try to take it out of someone else's hands",5,4,5,3
3877,2,"Censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies.  These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials.  What about the adults?  Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship, is not fair to the adults.     Books now are being rewriten so they won't have offevsive language in them.  To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a classic example of this.  Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it.  This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the african americans, and if that was altered the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism.  If libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them.     Music is another peice of material that censorship has gotten a hold of.  Offensive language is being taken out  of songs and uncensored cd's are not being sold in some stores because of censorship.  Some adults like the original songs with the original words.  Libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean verions of cd's to they some them that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to.     Movies are another peice of material that censorship has taken over.  They are being rated @CAPS3, suitable for all ages, @NUM1, suitable for children @NUM2 and older, and rated @CAPS4, suitable for people @NUM3 and older.  These rating are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie.  Libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs.  If a twelve year old kid wants to watch a @NUM1 or rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.     Censoship is a good thing but it doesn't need to be taken to the extreme.  If an adult wants to read a censored book, he or she should still be able to read it at their local libary and if a young kid wants to watch a rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.",4,4,4,2
3879,2,i think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult show's. i can see why they put it on the kid's show's.. but like really?you guys will put that stuff on good movies? or song's!? what has ever happened to freedom of speech?,1,1,1,0
3880,2,"Dear Newspaper:              @CAPS1, there should be censorship in libraries, but people should be a certain age just to check the book out. Some people go to the libraries just for censorship.          These days censorship basicly is how you get children or students just to pick up a book. Plus, if the parents aloud their child to read cebsorship books because they think it does no harm to the child which it don't. Put a @NUM1 and older section in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have @CAPS2 just to solve the age problem. However you do it the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people.          I no you think censorship should be taking off every shelf in the libraries, but they really shouldn't because I believe if you do that then the libraries will go out of business for good. That is the reason why the libraries should keep censorship on there selvies. I'm finish but I will leave you with this question: do you really want to take censorship out the libraries?",3,3,3,1
3883,2,"My say would be no. becuse all that was history, say you hade like a kkk thing or anything like that. say you had a wighting aport but need the information for that. you would need information for that and that information would have notes,dates and other thing",1,1,1,0
3884,2,"I do belive in censorship, but i do belive that it is not that big of a deal. It should the parants job to block materials that they think is bad for their kids. If it is to bad then it is the parants right to make sure that their kid does not see it.                  My point of view in stoping materials like books, music, movies, and magazines is that some things are not ment to be shown, read, and heard by someone of a yonger age unless they get the ok from their parents.     The views of censorship in my mind is that if someone see something they don't like they want to get rid of it and if is something to wrong then yes it should be censor, but if it could be avoided and is small like a word in a book then I say that people should be a little more understanding of it and try to think past it or try to find another path to take about it.     If you don't like something then maybe you should not read it or listen to it, and if is so bad don't let your kids get involved in it. I have never found a book and readed it and found it affensive or disterbing. I have found books that I don't like or are not good but never have I seen something so bad that I never want any one to read it.      If people are going to censor something I think it should be for a good reason not because they don't like the person or they think their idea is wrong, but for something that is bad about anetirer race or to graphic for a yonge age.     My point in censoring something in my mind is the right way to look at it we see it all the time in the real world people do something because they dont like some one they try some extreame things to get rid of some bad marerial, but in any case is a lot in this world that people should know about and when i do have kids I will decide wether to block something if I wont to and that is how it should be",3,3,3,1
3886,2,"When ever has a few bad things being said ever effected how or what people read @CAPS2 a days. That's what is hot in this present lifetime. No one wants to read a boring article, not unless it's meant to be. I'm going to share with you my opinions on certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, ect.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I have observations, experience, and reading some of my the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions.     In my opinion, no ones work should be taken off of a shelf due to any thing, because I'm sure they worked on it an awful lot for it to be placed on a shelf. So there is no reason for it to be taken off. If that was my stuff that had got took off the shelves I would be shocked and upset. So that is one reason why you shouldn't do that. It could hurt people emotionly.     Following that statement, but there can be times where you just don't want them to be seen because they are to embarrassing. Such as an athlete interviewed in an @CAPS1 article, that got suspended from their sport due to violations, and this athlete is just cursing and being out of control. I would put that article away also, just so the public won't see it and no one is put on blast.     Finally, @CAPS2 everyone knows that some types of movies, and music can't be put on display in public. So you would have to ask for the movie or @CAPS3 and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics. G-@CAPS4 @NUM1, should be the only movies allowed on shelves, rated @CAPS5 and up should be behind counter, and the same with music. I am pretty sure that is clear with this audience.     @CAPS2 that I have shared with you my opinions on different views on censorship in libbraries what is you thoughts on this topic as you read this persuasive essay.

3892,2,"Here in @LOCATION1, it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech. Freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and express individuality and opinions. This should also include books, music, movies, magazines, and any other form of entertainment. However, there will always be people that could take offense to others' ideas and opinions that comes with freedom of speech.     In a case where someone was to find a certain type of material to be offensive at a public library, then it should be known that he or she should not observe the type of material given. He or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable. It is in that person's standpoint that they should realize and come to grips with freedom of speech. What they @MONTH1 not like could very be what others do like.     So, why should other peoples' form of enjoyment be censored and taken away from them just because of one bad lemon? It shouldn't. Everyone expresses themselves in their own way. It's a form of getting positive and/or negative energy out in a healthy way. Whether it's writing books, posting articles, or writing music, it's a way to vent and some people @MONTH1 like that venting person's style. It is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. If there was a type of censorship, it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy. It would also be taking away the artists' or authors' freedom of speech and expression. There are books that were banned from schools throughout the country. Just because they think is right doesn't always mean it is right.

As everyone has their differences, there are always those who have a greater sense of curiousity, and prefer to think outside the box. However, it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge, if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study. Therefore, if a person is mature enough, and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library, they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing, with permission of a gaurdian of course.     Unfortunately, it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority. Libraries often times take in account a child's age as a factor towards what a they can, and can not read, but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read, and handle the more adult rated intell in a fashionable manner. If one is legally eligable, and they have permission from their gaurdian, then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library what-so-ever.

3907,2,"I do not think that any books should be taken out of libraries because they are found 'offensive'. Something that is offensive to me @MONTH1 not be offensive to another. Although I have all the right in the world to object to a book that I find inappropriate, somebody else might believe that that book is completely appropriate. The main issues that most people have with books are foul language, sex, and difference in opinion. These three catagories are very sensitive issues, some @MONTH1 not be comfortable disscussing these issues.      Many books in the library systems today contain foul language. Surprising enough a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section. I don't believe that parents would be very happy to know what their children are reading.     In our modern day world we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency. Books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines. Most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination, and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions.      Difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends. Religion, politics, and morals can lead to some nasty debates, but sometimes we have to just agree to disagree.       Can teenagers handle that kind of language and sexuality in a responsible way? Should the books be taken off the shelf just on the basis that we don''t agree with what it says? Should there be a sensor on what can and can't be put in libraries? I dont think that any books should be taken off of library shelves. If you don't agree with the book then don't read it. Instead of blaming libraries for what your children read, perhaps you should look at your own parenting and make sure they arn't reading something they shouldn't",4,4,4,2
3909,2,"Would you let someone ban your favorite movie, just because it has mildly offensive materials in it? I know I would not.  If everyone had the right to ban books then we would have no books, because something would offend someone. You should not ban books because it desecrates our individuality , we have the freedom of press, and because it would ruin the future.      If you ban a book then you are giving up your indiviuality. If you let someone decide what is offesive to you, then how can you express yourself. Therefore, by letting someone else decide what is appropriate for you to read, you are giving up your freedom. By banning books, you are not being yourself you are conforming to what other people want. Therefore, you should not ban books because, it demolishes your individuality, and it makes you conform to what other people want.      There should not be any banning of books. You should not be able to ban books because we have the freedom of press. The freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want. However, you should not ban books because we have the freedom to choose what we read. This means that we as individuals should be able to decide what we want to read and what we do not. You should not ban books because we have the freedom of press, and because we have the freedom as individuals to read what we want.     If you ban books then you will ruin the future. There are hundreds of really phenomenal books out there that would be banned, and future people would not be able to enjoy them.  There are books that can change your life, and teach you how to deal with things, and  if we ban them then we are ruining the chance to help future people with their problems. People turn to books for knowledge, and help, and for ideas, and if we take away their books then how can we say that we are paving the way for the future if we are destroying it along the way. Books should not be banned because if they were then, we would be ruining the future for others, and we would be destroying our own future.     In conclusion, books should not be banned because, it limits our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it destroys our future. If you ban books , more likely than not, your favorite book would get banned. Also, if everyone could ban books, then there would be nothing to read because all of the books would be banned. By banning books you are destroying the future, limiting our freedoms, and abolishing our indivuality.",4,4,4,2
3910,2,"Do you think that books, music, magazines, movies should be removed form a libraries shelf?     A libarys should carry every kind of book, movie, Magazines, Music etc.  The reason that a libary should carry every thing is because say a farmer wants to come in and get a book over cattle and some city person says that its no use and throws it away the farmer is outta luck or say the oppiset would happen.  Another reason would be a persons tasted some people like romance and some like action etc so if they dont carry one type someone will get mad about it and stop going. Say if @PERSON2 dose not like viloence so they take it off the shelf and @PERSON1 dont like chick flicks etc what would that leve in a libary no one would have anything to read and they would close the libary down because there would only be a few books.  The movies and magazines i would say carry anything that was approperat and if it was rated @CAPS1 you had to be @NUM1 to rent it then the person would be a adult. There is different cultures out there that only like certon thing so what are they going to do make seperate libarys so that each culture will be happy or just build one big libary and the ones that dont like just leve the book or whatever there.  Altmentley its up to the parent to tech there chiled noy yo pick up the bad items if there not liked by a certin family or cultuer.  If they would get rid of the stuff one person didnt like it would loss custmers and make others mad so in my eyes its better to have one person mad becaues a libary carryes a certian type of item then to loss custmers and make @NUM2 people or even two to make one person happy when it is as simple as dont pick it up.     So altimently we can not make everyone happy so just look over the items you do not like teach your childern not to bring them home and move on in life and dont start a problem",3,3,3,1
3913,2,"@CAPS4 I think all books,music,movies,magazines,etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason I say this is because what if their are little children that are willing too read grown up books and its all types of naked pictures and words thats not in a child vocabulary. Then they will pic up bad habbits and then use them with knowing what the words actually means.  Then, I think music should be edited because somer music has cursing and talking about things that a young minded child or children shouldn't hear. The music should only be something children are suppose too listen too things that are in their age group.    Next, I believe movies should be censored because now a days we are letting are children watch every and anything they want too. Things that doesnt control their language such as(@CAPS1 @CAPS2). I believe that @CAPS3 sahow needs too be blocked because they really do and say exclusive things on that show, and alot of childern watch and repeat every thing they hear and see of that show. Finally, magazines...I say @CAPS4 too magazines because they have neaked girls and men on the covers and pages of these magazines that shows just way too much and they put things in the magazines too them look real when they are actually not. I think that etc.. should only be used when needed too research and do homework because children use enternet too watch exclusive things and listen too such bad things.    Inconclusion, All together I think it should be an limit too everything we listen too and watch. Because children pick up everything they hear and see",3,4,3,1
3919,2,"Libraries are a source of information. They provide us with valuable research, entertainment, and cold hard facts. Therefore, I do not believe that libraries should have to censor the books that are supplied for the citizens to check out.      Everyone is faced with choices in life. Some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life. We decide if we want to wear the black shirt or the grey shirt, the blue shorts or the brown shorts. Everyday we have choices. We also have choices at a library. If we see a book with a title that sounds like @CAPS2 might be offensive, then we should just walk past @CAPS2. Most libraries are organized and the book sections are clearly stated. Common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material. We have the choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not. If @CAPS2 does offend us, then @CAPS2's our own fault.      The second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life. No one forces us to check out this book or that book. @CAPS2's a choice. No one puts a gun to our head and says, '@CAPS1 this book or you will die.' @CAPS2 just doesn't happen like that. No one forces us to @CAPS1 something we don't want to. @CAPS2's all up to you and how you feel about the book.      Different subjects offend different people. I'm not offended by a curse word here or there, however; I am offended by sex related instances that often occur in movies or books. I make my own choice to not watch or @CAPS1 those kinds of materials. Since everyone is different, the sex related instances might not offend another group of people and they might see @CAPS2 as perfectly fine to watch or @CAPS1. Different subjects offend different people and taking away a book or movie because @CAPS2 offends one person should not happen.      If libraries were to start censoring what materials they put on the shelf, I believe many people would be upset. Who would decide what is offensive and not offensive? @CAPS2 would upset too many customers and the use of libraries would probably dwindle. When you are in charge of censoring what goes on the shelf many problems come into play. Do you count different religions offensive because they blaspheme another religion's god? Do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because @CAPS2 contains one curse word in the whole book? There is no way to properly censor all your books without upsetting customers.     I'm not saying that libraries should be allowed to show every magazine known to man. Some are obviously worse than others; but, when @CAPS2 comes to books and movies, the people know what they are checking out and know what they will find offensive. There are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display. Libraries should not censor the materials they display",4,4,4,2
3922,2,"Books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways. They all are some how offensive to people if they have inappropreiate launguage or actions or stories in them. Should thease materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are to offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting ahold of them?      When I go to the library I see different sections, fiction, nonfiction, ect. What I don't see is a section marked 'offensive'. Librarys don't do that. If parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the childrens area.      Librarys usually don't carry offensive music. They have @CAPS1's for books to listen to. That might have offensive lauguage in it.  Before renting or buying the @CAPS1 you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they conscider it offensive or not. If they don't know then don't get the @CAPS1. Most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways.      If movies are offensice they are marked rated @CAPS4. @NUM1 movies are the better ones. If parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated @CAPS4 movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you. When I was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated @CAPS4 movies. She herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see.     Most of the time magazines don't have offensive lauguage in it but they sometimes have inappropreiate pictures of men and women. They also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read. But if your letting your children read this then you should read it before they do to make sure for yourself there is nothing you wouldn't want them reading.      I don't think there is any reason to remove books, music, movies, magazines, ect., from the shelves if they are offensive to some. If a parent or anyone else doesn't want their children or anyone else's children to read something they think is offensive they should make sure they read something before they let them read it. Also walk around with the child in the library to make sure they don't pick up anything they wouldn't like, or have their child pick things from the childrens section. Some people like reading books, magazines some might think are offensive. Everyone shouldn't be punished for those who just don't want their children finding offensive things in the library",3,4,3,1
3923,2,"Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way should not be aloud to be showed to the public. If these offensive things were not aloud to be showed I personally think it would help out are country is full of racist people and documents.      Everytime you pick up a magazine or you watch a television show about a famous actress or musician you see embarrassing aspects of their lives all over the world. This is not right at all! People should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in there life. If it wasn't for actress and musicians we wouldn't have any television shows to watch. There would be no use to have radio's. There would be no reason to, their would be nobody to sing songs for us. Why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways? They work their tails off to produce new things for us.     Books in the libraries should not have sexual assualts in them at all. Books like this in school libraries have no reason to be there. Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school? Expecially foul language in materials at school. Books at the library should have good examples in them not vaulgar sayings. This is a disgrace to the school.      Movies are a big concern. Any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted. Would you want your child brining home a movie that had nudity in the film? I remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from are local library. This movie was a total disgrace to this library it had nudity, foul language, and lots of violence. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. My library would have something like this in the library? Children go there and pick movies out. My mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films. She said that the movies should be seprate from the rest. You should have to be a certain age to rent this movie. Or atleast have a parents permission.     Every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community. Lets keep are children and young adults away from violence. By allowing this in are school libraries and local libraries it is just saying it's ok to letting this violence in. We should put a stop to it and prevote good attitudes. So please take the violence off the shelf",4,3,4,2
3924,2,"Are some materials, such as books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shelves if those things are found offenisve? There are some things in books are movies that are offensive, and that other younger adults shouldnt watch or read. Reading a book also says alot about certain topics that are offensive. But at the same time can you learn from these things such as finding it in a book or seeing it on tv.     So I dont think that certain things that are found offenisive should be taken off the shelves, because people should learn off of these things. Some people have a hard time understanding what's right and wrong in life, because their not getting the full effect in life and what it is meant. The problem I think is people @MONTH1 not think certain things are offensive because they might not know what it mean. Movies on the other hand has a different side of the fence. Movies can affect someone, especially someone who is very young. Those children can look what's on tv and copy exactly what they are doing. They also @MONTH1 be a role model which is not always good for some people.     Another thing is that music plays a big role in someone's life because there is sad music, loving music and also violent music. Music can define a person. For example if you are listening to a sad song, you @MONTH1 feel sad or depressed. Or a person listening to hard and violent music @MONTH1 feel upset or angry. Certain music that peole listen to can define who they are. Especially when i had said it determines what kind of a mood you are in. I think when people listen to the music he or she likes, it defines who they are, it shows what kind of mood there are in.     Secondly, magazines are an advertisement. It shows everything, it tells you stories. Just like in the movies if you see it, youre going to do it. But magazines are different, they show like the styles, and life stories of others. When you see things you @MONTH1 want to do things just as the what the magazine. Usually when you look in a magazine you usually see pictures so its not as big of effect as the others such as the music and movies. They more likely describe things.       Books on the other hand are similar. You can learn what's in a book just by reading it. So if a person @MONTH1 read something about voilence he or she @MONTH1 think it is right to do so. Even if that particular book is telling you what's right about the topic. So no I dont think that some books that are found offensive beacause only that person or indvidual can learn what being offensive is. So keeping these types of books @MONTH1 help other people who are readers.",3,3,3,1
3929,2,"What do you think about Books? Do you think it matters how appropriate they are? Well im going to tell you my oppinion on the books that should and shouldn't be in libraries.      I think that there are many different few from many different people on books. Someone just cant say that they think a book shouldn't be in a library period. I think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library. I can see that some parents @MONTH1 not want to have their kid reading it but i think that they are going to hear a lot worse and see worse than a book is going to have.      I can also see where parents are coming from when they say that they dont want there child reading that kind of book. I belive that if a kid wants to read it than they are going to read it, parents shouldn't be so up tight on what there kids read. I know that they want to protect their kid from seeing that stuff but its going to happen one day so they might as well get used to it. Also a grade school shouldn't even have a book that would be considered inappropriate to a student in there library, or should have a parent sign somethign saying that they are ok with it.     So inconclusion thats what I say if parents have a problem with it than they should discuss it with the school. They should just go in and talk to the librarian and tell them that they dont want their child to check out such books. All a parent would have to do is go in to the school or where ever their child is getting the book and tell them that and it would solve all problems",3,3,3,1
3930,2,"To censor, or not to censor? That is the question. I am positive that there are a great amount of different views portaining to this topic. Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using censorship in the library. Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries. First of all, how offensive can library material truly be?     I do not believe that is very offensive at all. There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group. This is fine; if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material. A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life. Sooner or later, they will have to be intruduced into the real life. It would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives. Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. There @MONTH1 be times when he does; however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet. This is an easy fix. As I said earlier, ther is no reason we all need to read the same thing.     Variety is what makes libraries apealing to the customers. Who would want to go to a library with all the same books? I myself would not. Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers. Also, this would discourage writers from even producing thier material; thus hindering their income and motivation. We have freedom and choice in @LOCATION1, and I feel this would go against @CAPS1 values if they were to induce censorhip in a harmless library.      No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. However, we can also improve and learn from them. If a person does choose an inapropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake. We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library. I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice.     Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information. This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed. I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended. Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning. I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good",3,4,3,1
3937,2,"Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' @CAPS1 what? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary. Here's why.     @CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you?     When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you. Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.     There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can't because you thought it was offensive. @CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. @CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless.     I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? Either way, you still must know that bannig these things in wrong.",5,4,5,3
3939,2,"There are many inapropriate types of intertainment in the world but does that mean we should take them all away? I believe that censoring things such as books, movies and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of intertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inapropriate.     With censoring materials in a library it will extremly limit on what we can learn. For example if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches it pray was offensive then if a person was interested in learnig about that topic they would not able to. Many peoples only way of reserch is at a library, so if they had on assignment for work and they could only get informatoin on it there they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offincive. Also people in the medical feild have to watch many movies deminstrating sertain proseedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a persons life.     With censoring there would be no diverstiy. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choise in what we could read for intertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for intertainment because it one person does not like a sertain book it can be gotten rid of. So if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from. It would cause all to read the same books therefor making the diverstiy very small.     I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inapropriate or offensive things but, that is what is in our world and i believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, haterid, sexually things, and profanity but there is no changing that. Censoring @MONTH1 hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society.     I do not think that we should censor thing in our libaries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communitys. It is a great idea but i do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cuz a lack in diversity education and a realization of our society",4,3,4,2
3940,2,"Now, one way or another that certain peice of material will be found and be used.     Someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others. So really, either way you @MONTH1 try to remove any material that you think is offensive but is it your right? I don't suppose so, I would consider that unfair. It's unfair that you were able to see this material and just because you thought it was offensive, it does not mean that others @MONTH1 find that offensive in their opinion.     So the idea of pulling them off the shelf for your own selfish opinion is ridiculous. For you to do that would be defeating the purpose of being an @CAPS1 for the author of that material. Having the freedom to sell or convey something they want viewers, readers, listeners, etc. to look at and use, would not happen because a person or a small group of people consider it offensive. It's big world out there, you think just because you can try and hide certain material from people in your area to see, that no one will find a way, people will always find a way for it to get out or be found.     It would be as if your trying to control what people should be viewing, listening, reading, etc. Almost as if your in control of people, but you got to realize that you can't hide everything in this world. Also that not everybody in this world has the same mind set as you do, and that what ever you find offensive @MONTH1 not, or actually does not mean everyone else does.      So this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or group of people find offensive. Do not try to control what people or childeren should view, listen, or read becuase it will be found sooner or later. No matter how hard you want this world to be perfect, reality is that it won't happen and you can't keep everthing hidden",4,4,4,2
3941,2,"Most people do not think that kids should see certain things if they are found offensive. Like some books, music, movies, and magazines. I do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from libraries shelf.           It should be the parent choice to what their child can look at or listen to. But now days when a child parent or any other authority don't let them do, watch, or listen to something it make  kids want it more. Since they want it more they will find away to do, watch, or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be. They will even go behind there parents back and probably won't care if they get in trouble.           With this new generation authority can only limit so much of what children see today. Children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways. Computers, televsion, and the radio are three differnt major ways of finding things that maybe offensive but kids are interested in all the time. Young parents i do believe is one of the reasons kids know about these movies, books, music, and magazines. They say things and do things that young people should not know at a young age. That what make kids think its alright when their parents do what ever it maybe. So let it be the parent choice of what there child can see. Cause either way they going to be able to find away to get it.",2,3,2,0
3945,2,"We all find things offensive, wether it be in a book, magazine, movie, cd, tv show, or a newspaper article. Libraries hold all of those items and somepeople @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right? If everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left.      Maybe writers should just cut down on things that are innapropriate, racist, or things that include foul language. Then not as many people would be offended and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own. Although, it @MONTH1 not be the writers at fault here. It @MONTH1 be the readers. Some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading.     Yes most adult things now are innapropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies. And parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the childrens section. All types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that. If parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about the reading or watching something they should not be. That is what parents are for, taking care of their children and some people do not do a very good job of that.     If there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age. And maybe then it would be ok of they read it, because they are old enough to realize right from wrong. Parents can not always control what their children do. And if they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they @MONTH1 see it in a different way than their mother of father did and they @MONTH1 learn a very valuable lesson from it.",3,3,3,1

I'm not condoning that someone should read books, listen to music, or even watch movies that could be hateful or cruel, but by the law its ok for people to want to read, listen, or watch those works.      Libraries are government funded organizations. Therefore meaning they dont have the right to disregard these works. The government pays for the books that are purchased into the library. This means they need books that people would want to read, and be interested in even though some gruops of people might not agree its there job.      I'm not encouraging reading these novels or listening to offensive music, but as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we are allowed to listen to what we want, and read anything we want, because thats what our country is meant to stand for freedom. When I think of @LOCATION2 i think freedom, and i have to say I'm proud our country stands for that, and we should  stand for that freedom even when it comes to the small things in life",4,4,4,2
3947,2,"Know you ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries.  Well ok then I will you my not like what I have to say but I really dont care @CAPS1 if it was up to your dam goverment to decide what we could say or what we can read or even do. Theyd have us all in our house with our hands tied so we couldent learn more then how to eat, clean, and dress our selfs.      Now the way I see it is that we have every rite to read any book we please when we whant to read it. now if we dont want to read a book then we dont have to read it. but we as a people and they as a goverment do not have the rite to take your books out of the libraries. Now we as a people can press any thing we want @CAPS1 no matter what they as in the goverment thinks it is the people who run the stat not the dam goverment.     My point is, is that the books are there to teach us about our lives, our histoy. Books teach us about what wrong and what is rite. Books are here to give sceary story by a camp fire they are here to give kids a bed time story.  If we take thos books off our shelves you think the kids of your generation are bad just wait @CAPS1 the next one will be worse than this one i promise you that.      Now it is our rite to save our books, @CAPS1 if we do not then us as @CAPS3 will be lost. For without book our passed is lost, our fock tales are forgoten, our kids will not be able to sleep at night without there storys.      Now come guy as a all pull it together. If you see a book on the shevles and you think its offences then by @CAPS4 put the dam thing down and walk away from it dont complane about it. No one told you that you had to read it. So don't ruine it for everyone just @CAPS1 eather you dont belive in @CAPS4 and you think that the bibles not rite then dont touch. its the same way around if you do bleave in @CAPS4 and you think that all book that tell about a witch or vampires or that my even have a hore house in just leave it alone. its just a dam book let us read them. See you guy blame us kids that the vido games roten our minds but realy its the parent that dose @CAPS1 see there is nothing more a teenanger like myself loves to do more than to do something there mom or dad says not. So gut just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do.",3,3,3,1
3953,2,"'@CAPS1 are you reading' asked mom. I immediatley hid the book behind my back, knowing she wouldn't like the idea of me reading such an in depth book. Some parent don't like for their kids to read some content. If it's not okay at home it shouldn't be okay at school. There is some subjects that maybe we shouldn't but we do because our parents say no. Removing said subjects will remove the chance of disobeying or parents, and coping behavor from book.                There are books, movies, magazines and music that is 'cool', but not all that appropriate. Some movies and music use offensive language and actions that some kids pick up on and refelct actors, actresses and artists. Soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid. Students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed, so they feel the need to do things to become noticed. Most things students model after are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as the media.      It is wise to set censors in the libraries, for students. Though some students don't nessicearily want censorship in libraries, it is only for their best intrest to remove materials that are offensive. It will make students including myself better people by not learning of the things we hear about or watch. I think by using censorship it will help student to make the decison at home to to become involved in such thing.      I have noticed that students often watch how movie stars and famous people act, if they are a fan or the famous person then they are more likey to model after them and do the thing they do. Lets say I was a fan of @PERSON1 and I read that she stole something. Being a fan of her I would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it cool. If I did the things @PERSON2 done my parents would most likely kill me, and if I got luck somehow and they didn't then I would go to jail for sure.      So  in conclusion, I think censorship is important in libraires because it insures the well being of students and protects them form things they odn't need to be part of. I would respect the idea of censory in my school becaus eI would know it is only there to help me. I hope that all students see that it is important not to be subject to violence, sex, drugs, drama, through movies, music, magazines, or book",4,4,4,2
3956,2,"Censorship can be a very good thing. It keeps inapropriate material from falling into the wrong hands. It also keeps the horrors that are in the sensored material out of the community and that makes the community a better environment to live in. But too much censorship can become a bad thing. For instance @ORGANIZATION1 had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning all of those books. There also several books that talk about the censorship idea getting out of hand like the book @CAPS1 @NUM1. Libraries should censor some of there material.      Books and magazines need to be censored according to there content. Books and magazines both use words and sometimes pictures to get there point across. If a book is using vulgar and inapropiate language in should be in some way censored. With this in mind I should not be able to pick a book and open it to find sexual dialog. I also shouldn't be able to find the constant use of swear words in a book or magazine. Also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of gore. Magazines and books also use pictures to help get there point across. If there are inapropriate pictures in either of the two sources that material should be censored. If I am walking through my local library and just see a magazine sitting ou with a nude picture on the front I'm going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Another example would be that I pick up a book and start looking through it and it has an inapropiate picture in it, I am going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Also if a magazine has an extremly violent picture or extremely gorey picture it should be cnesored. Overall if a book or magazine is extremely inapropriate, then it should be, in some way, censored.     Music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored. Musicians use artwork on the album sleeves to grab the attention of people. If that artwork includes swear words or inapropriate pictures it should be in some way or shape be censored. Musicians also play music of course. But if the lyrics to there songs are explicit or has many sexual themes it has to be conesored. Someone should have to deal with wading through music like that. No matter what, if an album of music is out of this world inaproiate, it should be censored.     Movies are most likely the hardest things to sensor. This is because they use language, pictures, music, and video. Movies are multi-media monsters that can sometimes be very clean, and sometimes be very inapropriate. If a movie is rated @CAPS2 it should not be in a public library. Movies that are rated @CAPS3 for seual content, nudity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or swearing should be censored. A kid should not be able to get his hands on that kind of stuff in a public library. Also depending on how violent and a gorey a movie is it should be cenesored. Movies that are inapropiate, especially ones rated @CAPS3, should be censored.     The fact that this debate even needs to happen is sad. But it does so we must censor certain things that people @MONTH1 get a offended by if they saw it in there public library. Things containing nudity, sexual content, swear words, gore, and violence to possibaly be censored. There also needs to be a line where we stop sensoring or pretty soon, just like Katherine Paterson said we won't have any books left. But overall there needs to be some type of censorship in public libraries.",4,4,4,2
3958,2,"Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldnt have. Well of course I think that there are some books, music, movies, magazies, that young children should not read about, hear, or watch. These kind of things affect our every day living.      Lets start off with a book that has killing in it. I'm not a parent at the time, but I know for a fact that I would not wan't my children reading about that kind of violence. Thats not something that a twelve year old child should be reading about. Those kind of books could get kids thinking oh he killed someone why couldn't I, and thats how some kids grow up to be bad and have to go to jail at the age of @NUM1, because they have killed someone or tried at least. There also other books that some children shouldn't read about and that @MONTH1 be about slavery. If a mother doesn't want their child to know about slavery at the age their at there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten year old to read about. I mean if I had family members that lived in the slavery days i for sure wouldn't wan't my kids to read about it, because that shows how white people disrespected the blacks and that could have an affect on that child. That could cause them not to like white people.     Second is the music. I know that most libraries don't have all that bad music that is on the radios, but I'm sure there is some music that has something about steeling on it. Thats aother thing that could give kids the wrong idea and send them on the wrong track again. There's just some things children shouldn't hear unless their with one of their parents, and then that parent could explain to them that you shouldn't do what the song says. But they shouldn't be in our school or public libraries.     The third thing is movies. There should not be any movies of killing, breaking in peoples houses or fighting at any sircumstance in a school library. School is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things. That just gives a young child the wrong kind of idea, and isn't approperiate for schools to have.     The last one is magazines. There should notbe magazines at school of women in their bathing suits or men with out shirts on. That could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble.     Thats what I think about the books, music, magazines, and movies in a library.",3,3,3,1
3966,2,"I'm ok with censorship on reading materials. I understand that the poeple selling the prodects want to appel to the eye and make poeple buy what they are selling. I have alot experience with this because I read alot of car magazines and they sometimes have alot models in them, but I'm your avage seventeen year old and I'm ok with this also, but there is a lamt.     My school is very good about this they see one flag it and put it in the back , but they still let you read it. I like this because it keeps the bad apples off the self. I have a very good kinship with my mom and dad they do tell me I can get, but if it's nineiy-five perent cars and only five perent models they are ok with that.     I said a thing about limt. All things have a limt like how much hosepower stock parts can take on a car before they break. I have a limt on what I buy sent I'm not yet eightteen I can only car magazines but don't get me wong I love cars and have sent I little",3,2,3,1
3968,2,Isn't there a saying in the world called its a free country? I thought it wasthere are alot of things that people should not see in the world. But we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lie's to the world we live in. From the media to the press to poparasi maybe even from the people around you they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people.          There thing's out there that we the people don't know nothing about that the goverment and world shields from our eyes. Then there's the things that we are showin by the world like @PERSON1 alot of people think what happend to him is offensive. Not only that but racisim in general also the news why would people put violent things on the news like murder storys and kidnapping and robberys and many more. People find that offensive and even scary to alot of people but yet we keep it on there.                                                                  So no i don't think it should not be removed from shelves and or were ever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supportors and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) thing's. Say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army. Nobody stopped that. If we as people are not going to come togeather and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed then whats the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when your going to end up doing it to. And your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting . Everyone has and opinion and wants to demained it but people are diffrent and some will always see it diffrent than what you see it.                                                       So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside. Dont watch it dont read it dont try to hear about it from a friend or stranger leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone. And then you wouldnt have even known about it. Live life and dont worry about the negative lets focus on the positive of what you see.,3,3,3,1
3969,2,"'Can I read this?'  @CAPS1 a round the world have asked this or been asked this question. @CAPS1 have their own right to read what they want, but are the childern alound to? There are books that children or young adult should read and should not read. This @MONTH1 vary for it depends on age, and the way the reader will understand the content of the books. There are cursing, smut and @CAPS4 in books that for children should not read.     In highschool there are some books like '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' that has cursing in it. For highschoolers of @NUM1 or older will be alright to read. Highschoolers understand and has heard these words more than once before. If a teacher gives this book to a @NUM2 grader they would not understand the full potential it hold for the learning of it. Childern in that age range will not understand that the man is handicaped, then the childern would not understand the killing the handicaped man had done or why his friend killed him after it.      Will a parent let a @NUM3 year old read a smut novel? This depend on the way the parent was raised and how the feel it will effect the childs development. An @PERSON1 book would not be approprent for a child of that age for the child does not, and will not understand the book it self. The book is more then just that one part of smut. There is a gothic and romanic was of writing to @PERSON1 books. A child of @NUM3 years old would not have developed the mature way of think of the book.      @CAPS4! '@CAPS4 is not the answer.' Everyone has heard this saying. This say is said but its not followed. Young adults play video games, read books in school related to @CAPS4. '@ORGANIZATION1's don't @CAPS5' is a book of a colored teenagers going to a white school. This is a book giving the kids to see how things were. A child in elematenry would think its funny if a cartoon is played for them and someone gets hit. The children will is it a game and do not have enough background or maturity to under stand what is really happening and that it is wrong to do that. For just watching a tv show with hit or punch the child will think it is ok to do it.     Over all there will be @CAPS4, cursing and smut novels out there. The thing it depends on the parents and maturity level of the person/child. There is a wrong and right way to do it but for @CAPS1 it not right to let some underage read a curse, voilents, or smut",3,4,3,1
3970,2,"Almost everyone has a movie they would like to see, or a book they would like to read. What happens if they take a trip to the library, and check the catalog, only to find out it had been removed from the system because of bad language or mild themes? I believe that people should be able to choose what content they decide to read and let their children read. Some parents don't allow much offencive material at all while others don't mind it. Also the books and movies for adults are different than children books and movies. It would not be fair to remove offencive books, music, or magazines, from the shelf because different people like different content.     Today, we live in a world of violence and it is going to be hard to avoice violence and offencive material. For some people, they want to avoid it at all costs, while others don't care or they like it. First of all, different people consider the same content differently, and the titles being removed @MONTH1 not be judged fairly. The people who want to see the latest movies that just came out, are usually going to see some type of violence. With more advanced computers and technology, there can be more special effects and move violence added to movies easier. In books, they @MONTH1 have old language that isn't up to the standards of today. For example, in the @NUM1 and @NUM2, when the word 'gay' used to mean happy. It is a whole different word now and it is a lot of old books and songs. Some people @MONTH1 find that offensive and some @MONTH1 not.     Adult content is very differnt than children content. Adults have movies and music based on real life situations and stories while most children content is based on the alphabet and sing alongs. There are also the more grown up kid movies like @ORGANIZATION1's '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 one is based in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1 training to be a hero. During his fights, he kills the creatures that he fights. So if the libraries started censoring mateirals, then a classic @ORGANIZATION1 movie would be considered violent. The adult movies are worse in every way. They involve cursing, killing, gun battles, and sexual content. I'm not going into any further detail about adult movies. Being an adult, one should have the choice of what they are going to watch and the judge of what they are going to let their children watch.     Different people like differnt content and it is only fair for them to be the one to decide what they watch and consider violent. An example one person might grow up around a farm and be used to seeing animals killed, while one who grew up in a neighborhood has never seen an animal killed. When they both see the movie or read a book with an animal killed, it will have hardly an effect on the one from the farm compared to the likely painful effect on the one from a neighborhood. Think about a gun battle scene of a movie or a death in a book. A soldier who is in the army will take killings and seeing deaths much easier than a @CAPS4 of a company. As stated before, different people prefer differnt types of content.     All in all, I don't think there should be any censorship on library content. It should be up to the parents to make the choice of what they are going to let their childern watch or read. Adults can also be the judge of what they let themsleves watch. Lastly, again, different people like different content and it's not fair for one to choose what another can or can't watch",4,4,4,2
3976,2,"Censorship?     Have you ever been looking for a book and not being able to find it? Have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf? Well if you have, you have experienced censorship. Censorship is where things are sheltered from the the light of day. A specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries.     Most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines. A big question I ask is why? Well I can tell you why. Most people of today are too afraid of what other people think. Everything and everyone has to be perfect. I strongly disagree with this because if someone writes a book, they should not be afraid to put something in it because of what other people have to think about it. If they do not like it, then do not read it.     I do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people. If there is a article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it, you are going to stop and read it . If it has a good message to send to you will think about it. Then once you have thought about it, you will make your own opinion on what that article said. If you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it. If you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at the next time you go by there.     If you think that something is too bad for eyes of other people then so be it. That is your opinion and you have all of the right to it. I will not dislike you for your opinion and I will not look at you any differently. The only thing I hope is that I got my point across to you.",4,4,4,2
3977,2,"I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship.     A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the @PERSON1 books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it.     Music shouldn't be censored. Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. Each generation has it's own style and music, has it's own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves.     Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so childern can watch them. If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it.     Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. People deserve to know what's going on. People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefor making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them.     You can't please everyone, so just elt us make our own decisions. Censoring our libraries is like censoring us. We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? They can't keep us dumb by hiding things. We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin",4,4,4,2
3978,2,"In the words of the author, Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the sheld---that work I abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 are countless books in the world which will offend someone in one way or another. If everyone were to expect their feelings to be accounted by everyone, they are mistaken. Everyone has a right to discover the thoughts of others as long as they keep in mind they @MONTH1 not always be pleased with the outcome. Certain books carrying harsh opinions or uncencored material can be found on every shelf. As my many years as a student, I have come to find books containing vulgar images and language.     @PERSON1's play '@CAPS2' describes him in very crude ways. Our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved. @CAPS2 was described as a 'black ram' by his nemesis. Comments such as these in books can mold a young mind into thinking name calling is appropriate. Unfortunately, this is how children are to learn the nature of select authors and the world outside the classroom. @PERSON1 also discusses a 'strumpet' in '@CAPS2'. Once a mind is aware of such adult matters they will look at the world completely different. Life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products.     Magazines are a threshold of adult matters. Once a teenager or child view all the vibrant advertisements and beautiful models selling products, they begin to lose a sense of reality and childhood. The photoshopped images of tall, tan, and thin models make a girl's head ponder that way of life. They begin wearing shorter skirts, dieting, and tanning all because of an ad they saw in their magazine. Who wouldn't want to be like a model? When every actress, singer, and model begin looking like godesses, the men picture the perfect girl as the ones they see on billboards. After the men picture the ultimate female as the images they see, the women will never be able to add up to their qualifications. A whole cycle of being underappreciated and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful.     In conclusion, the world has become absorbed in the unrealistic fantasies racy books and magazines provide. Crude comments are found in classics and are a powerful influence on the mind. Advertisements in magazines cause a sense of worthlessness in women and the feeling of unfulfillment for men. Are you going to control you're life or let the media?",4,4,4,2
3980,2,People out there have the right to descide weather or not there childs books have censorship in it. Some parents dont want there child to read books like that till they get older. Kids in grade school dont know the book they are getting has profanity in it.           I think that in all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them. Yea some parents dont care what their child reads. Think about the ones that do. Not every one has the guts to say something to the school. If you ask me i would not but books with censorship in them in my childs school.     Then again the high school students are old enough to look threw the books and descide if they want to get that book or not. Yea some parents still care about their child when they get into high school but high school students are old enough to make their own descions. Some students @MONTH1 not relize what book they grabed untill they start reading but thats when they turn around and exchange it. I think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books.     This is why I think bout the books and magazines etc. with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools. If you agree YOU can do something about it. Talk to your childs school,3,3,3,1
3981,2,"Remain on the Shelf?     Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contian offensive information that many would want censored. The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive, the way people take in information is the main factor. People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that dont consider them to be offensive.     What is offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the next. Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. Whether it be a book, magazine, or music the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from as song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday.     These magazines and books could also be seen as informing. The material in a certian magazine @MONTH1 not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likley be nothing left. Removing them could cause choas to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. Certian materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesnt offend them offends the next person. Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge.     Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. From my experience teenagers are interested in alot of action and romantic films and books. They often times contain alot of physical and sexual content along with a decnt amount of foul language. A older person would not be interested in the foul language and content, they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more becasue they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing alot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest.     Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. People are not being made to read and watch what offends them. Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor @MONTH1 not offend me. Chances are that there will alwasy be something that is going to offend at least one person. The more we all get used to it , the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. They @MONTH1 still be offended on the insided but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing",4,4,4,2
3983,2,"You Are @CAPS1 You @CAPS2?     Censorship is a touchy subject in our society today.  People ask, '@CAPS3 much should be censored?' or even 'Should @CAPS9 be censored at all?'  @CAPS4 opinion is that censorship should be left up to the parents of the children that are reading, listening to, or watching materials.  Television networks and reading companies, including publishers and libraries, can't possibly take the place of a parent.  I believe that if a parent is not responsible enough to care @CAPS1 the child is reading, the distrubuters of the materials can't be punished.     In @CAPS4 experience, @CAPS4 mother has taken part in censoring me from offensive materials from a very young age.  She is always interested in @CAPS1 I am reading.  Occasionally, she will glance over a book or reading material herself in order to deem it appropriate for me to @CAPS2.  @CAPS4 mother has also censored @CAPS4 music by glancing through @CAPS4 music player and every so often, playing a song or two.  @CAPS9 discourages me from listening to anything that @CAPS4 mother wouldn't approve of.  I have also experienced censorship in @CAPS4 local library.  The library is divided into sections, begining with the children's books.  These books are appropriate for young minds and have no offensive material.  @CAPS9 section leads to young adult, then eventually the adult books.  The music is also similarly divided into these catagories.  I believe @CAPS9 is acceptable because there are certain materials and music that a young child should not be exposed to.     Through reading the book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' by @PERSON1, I have observed that parents need to have some involvement in @CAPS1 their children are reading, listening to, and watching.  In @CAPS9 book, @PERSON2's parents simply left him alone while he was in his room.  They let him listen to his own music, and watch @CAPS1 he wanted.  @CAPS9 led him to listening to a @CAPS7 metal band called '@CAPS7 @CAPS8.'  @CAPS9 band influenced him to commit a homocide in his school, killing ten students.  @CAPS9 is a worst case scenario in which censorship was not practiced at all.  Violence can have a large impact in young kids; therefore, they shouldn't be exposed to it until they are mature.     Through @CAPS4 reading, I have taken the position that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the whole population.  The novel '@CAPS10 @NUM1' is an example of censorship being taken to the extreme.  Reading is banned in their society, except for comic books and sex magazines.  @CAPS9 shows that without a right to @CAPS2, society is reduced to very simple, uneducated creatures.  Censoring an entire people's reading is impractical.  @CAPS4 opinion is that once a person is an adult, they have the common sense and maturity to @CAPS2 whatever they choose.     Censorship is difficult to take a stand on because ther are so many posatives and negatives to consider.  @CAPS4 position on @CAPS9 vital subject is that parents should be the ones censoring their children's reading, not the government or the reading companies.  Once a person is an adult, their right is to choose whatever they like to @CAPS2.  Reading is a magical thing that should not be held back from adults who are prepared to experience it to its fullest.  As long as society keeps a balance between the outcome of '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' in which censorship was not practiced, and '@CAPS10 @NUM1' in which it was enforced to the fullest, I believe that we have reached an appropriate balance.  Censorship is healthy for children, but restricting in adults.",5,5,5,3
3985,2,"Dear Newspaper staff, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is @PERSON1 I @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 I am in the @NUM1 grade. The reson for this letter is that I belive that certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive. The reson why I think it should be done because kids know days minds be every where from pron to games to bad music etc.            In @CAPS7 books, magazines, movies, have things in it that shouldnt be in there. When kids get a hole of it they act like they anit never seen nothing like it. When they get on the computer they get on web sites that they know they are not suppossed to be on. If we didnt have these things we wouldnt have to worry about the loud music, the virus on the computer and the books being riped up. But know a days there are so much stuff people can do to get all of things.           If someone just removed all the things that are found offensive from the shelves. That would be so wonderful for everyone. If they leave all the materials out there its going to be more and more problmes. When they just take it off everything will be in grate shape",3,3,3,1
3989,2,"People of the world @MONTH1 always find something they think is offensive that others don't. In this case I think that if it is in a public library they do need to watch what they put on the shelves. If some little kid grabs a playboy from the youngster's section, the library is probably going to get sued. Libraries are supposed to be a place where people can get a book to read or to look up some information about any school-work they have. Books about anatomy are an exeption but if that library has a book like sex for dummies then something needs to @CAPS1 in that facility.     Movies too, if somebody wants that kind of material they need to go else where to find it. Exposing those kinds of movie clips and images could be harmful to the children of future @LOCATION1. If our world crashes as we know it because kids couldn't find the correct information needed, then that shows that we deserved it.    What kind of movies we watch, advertisement we pay attention to, what music we listen to most, and many other things are what make people who they truly are. People these days read magazines that can be completely harmless but come with an ad. that says @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or All @CAPS4 @CAPS5, these are found in a lot of magazines like @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and sometimes @CAPS8. These ads. are totaly uncalled for.     If people looked into this more, than they do we wouldn't have to fight this as much.     These things that people find to be offensive are harsh and cruel things to show our young readers, writers, and musicians. These type of things influence kids to do this type of stuff that americans and non-americans find so offensive. So libraries be aware of what you put on your shelves and be aware of the consequences.",4,4,4,2
3990,2,"Censorship is a tough topic to discuss. Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view?     For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated @CAPS1. I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it shoulld be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages.     Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a @CAPS2 has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a @CAPS2 can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to.     Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, i don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you.     With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech.",4,4,4,2
3992,2,"Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, ect. All of these  are factors found in our books and music we have today. Do you believe these items should be cencered? If books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adult's choices on what they do in life. I feel that, yes books and music should be cencored.          My first supporting reason of why books and music should be cencored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information. Look in today's world; murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse. If a book or song is advertising about murdering some one, or selling drugs nine times out of ten people think that is the 'cool' thing to do so why not do it. With people following uncencored books and songs it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices. Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer preasure.     The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect. Some books or music affends people by their race, religion, or their apperance. You find most of the critizisium from music more than books, but it does occur. Young children and teens shouldn't listen to or read about racism, sex, how to drugs, ect. Books and music that have advertisment about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children. The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this. A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or book without getting disrespected and offended.     My final reasoning for books and music being cencored is the reputation it will have or has. Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others. For instance, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 tend to have a lot of bad messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are bad. If songs and books were cencored there wouldn't be a sterio type against a certain type of music, or books have the best message. A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material.      Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read. If books and music are cencored there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence. Again I state, yes I feel books and music should be cencored.",4,3,4,2
3997,2,"If content in a library is considered offensive, @CAPS1 should still remain on the shelf regardless. Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many, but select few will still value the media for what @CAPS1 is. Taking one kids cake because @CAPS1 has to much frosting would anger most kids (and adults).If a book, album, movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material @CAPS1 should remain organized with the rest of @CAPS1's kind, not exiled in the furthest corner. When one checks out such media @CAPS1 they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropiate and/or offensive content.I personally find @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or in the context of a song, @ORGANIZATION1 fascinating. Every time i look up these poems i have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with @CAPS1's violent or hateful content. Although, I do agree @CAPS1 should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read(or listen) without their consent.I believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice. No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to.",3,3,3,1
3998,2,"Some materials could be seen as offensive to some people. It could have language, racial slurs, or anything else one might find offensive. In my personal opinion I believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose.     These books or movies are put out there for entertainment or learning purposes. Some things did happen, such as the @LOCATION1, that many people would like to forget but no matter which way you take it, it happened and we can't change it. This can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place, so they will not do it.     Language is a big part of today's world and many do not appreciate a bad word. They put these in movies to emphasize somthing big because everyone will remember that word. I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out, but for some movies a certain word could make or break the scene. Some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie. A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count but the stroy line is phenominal. What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing, it's the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time.     As for books in libraries, we should make a seperate section for these offensive materials so that a young, innocent child does not wonder across them. Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a speical sticker on the book to warn parents as well.     In conclusion, offensive materials are not always bad and should not be removed from shelves, just mabye to a different location. Let the people read what they want to read.",4,4,4,2
4002,2,"Libraries should or should not have books, music, magazines that are found offensive? Some people like things that are different than what you or anyone else like you @MONTH1 think some of the things are offensive, but yet again something you don't like someone else @MONTH1 like, and want to read. Would if be fare to you that you like something, and want to read it, but someone else dose not like, and thinks that it offens them, and they should take it off a shelf at a public library because of what that person said.      I don't think that thinks like that should be taken off a shelf for something like, becasue there could be a person in school that needs soemthing like that is not right for a child to be looking at,but what if there is a kid in high school or collage that needs a book to do a project over that type of things, but also yes I do think that things that little kids should not be looking at or listening or reading something like should not be able to get a hold of because parents should not have to worry about them going to a librariy, and there children see something that they do not want them to see. There are vary many ways that people that work in the libraries can keep things up from children that is to little to see or hear what there parents do not want them too. Some ways that you can do that is by putting all the books and music that is like that in a section of the library that you have to be a sertent age to be able to go look or listen to them.      Lubraries are for everyone no matter what you look like or dress. You as a person has the right to go in to a public library and look for something to read no matter if it has some curse words or some violence in the reading. If you are reading those kinds or books you should be machure for your age and not have to worry about it. You hear and see everything that you read about today so I don't see the difference in if a child hears or sees it beacuse you see it just about every where you go now days. You really can not get away with out dealing with it",3,4,3,1
4006,2,"Many individuals vist different libraries all over the world everyday. Some for books, some for magazines, some for movies. Everyone has different taste so a libary is where they go, because they have absolutley everything.       Libraries have all kinds of amazing different books. It is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research. There should be no  limits on what  books, movies, magazines, ect., are on the shelf. Everyone has different beliefes/feelings on what they would like to read or see.     If libraries starting limitting their options, i don't think that they would have as much business and people would not read as much. Which means that an indivudal's @CAPS1 could go down. Reading helps everyone in this world, by learning new vocabualry and just excersizing their own eyes. By taking away someone's intrest, they won't read as much, or feel as free.     Just because someone doesnt like something, does not mean the next person won't. If a book or movie, ect., is offensive to someone they just just simply not read it or watch it. No one has the right to take over someones mind of what they are interested in.     However limmiting the age groups for certian items would not be a horrible idea. Books that @MONTH1 be offensive or not approiate for a young child should not be aloud to be seen or checked out by a young child, but that does not mean take it away from others.",3,3,3,1
4014,2,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 the author, Katherine Paterson. Her quote means that there might be a book, magazine, etc., on a shelf that someone shouldn't see. I beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are ways people can avoid seeing them. I think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle.     First off, if there are items that people find offensive then they should be placed in a specific aisle. There are things that only adults should see so therefore there should be an aisle dedicated to the offensive or inapropriate things. And for someone to get into that aisle they should have permission to get into the aisle and show and I.D. so that kids and children don't accidently slip in and see things they shouldn't. Because if a child sees something bad, then that might influence them to do bad things because they won't know any better.     Secondly, if an indivual finds a book or magazine offensive, then they can avoid it by simply walking away. That person doesn't have to read it or look for it in a library if it's in a certain aisle. But if someone is really offended by something then all they have to do is go complain to the person head of the library and it can simply be removed if there are enough compaints. Then again, it's not that hard to avoid something you don't like. It might bother you that it's there, but it should be out of the way for younger kids to see.     Thirdly, the library will contain things that are found either offensive or inapropriate so children entering the library should have adult supervision so that they don't see the bad things. If a child sees something bad, they might find it interesting so they might want to pick it up and read it, which is bad because it might give them ideas.     Finally, there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive. You can walk away if you notice something you find offensive or you stay away from that area of the library. There are going to be many things out there that people find offensive and inapropriate, but there's not much you can do about it. The best thing to do is ignore it and walk away. And if you're that concerned about it then you can always make a complaint about what has offended you or what you think is inapropriate for children. Putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea because little kids won't be able to access it.",4,4,4,2
4017,2,"There are two things that i would have to say about removing books off of a library's shelf. First being that there will always be something offensive to someone no matter what it @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be. Second, no matter what you do or try to do there will always be something that a child will do or see that you @MONTH1 not want them to see or do.     If people could remove things that they find offensive then there wouldn't be anything on shelves or in stores or really anywhere. There are too many different kinds of people who @MONTH1 dislike too many differnt things from anyone else. If a person were to remove a book, and another person wanted to get that book, but found that a person requested it to be removed that person whouldnt be happy and stop coming back to that library after one person had to ruin something they enjoy because they found it offensive.     So what if a book found offensive was removed? there are much worse things on television. Cartoons are more violent then what most books are, more and more commercials and other types of advertising are using wemon, money, and fame to lure people. Most of the time they are not meant for children, a billboard on the way to school advertising an alcohol product, or some kind of adult enjoyment, they are part of life.     No matter what you @MONTH1 try to do to keep your child 'safe', just will not work these days. No matter hard a person @MONTH1 try to change something they find offensive there will be something just as equal around the next vorner, be it a billboard, a poster, a movie cover, or a band, someone will always find something offensiv and teach their children to do the same but, just beacause someone @MONTH1 not like something does not mean their children or anyone else's childer will not eiuther",3,3,3,1
4018,2,"Conflicting works of art such as books, music, and movies, have always been seen in libraries. Whether it's @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1, someone is going to be offended. But whether or not these offending works should be banned is a common topic among authors, musicians, and movie-goers alike. I personally believe that all of these works have a right to be seen, heard, or read, because the creator has put much effort into stating their opinion and have a right to freedom of the press.         You could take any famous work and someone could be offended @CAPS5 it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs. But this does not mean that that work should be banned! Banning a book would mean total rejection to the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has a right to those. The censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we have total freedom of the press. You simply can't apply censorship because whether you keep it on the shelves or not, people are going to be offended. Also, as shown in @PERSON1's @CAPS4 @NUM2, the censorship of books could lead to a society unable to have a real knowledge of the past and the feelings and thoughts of the people of that age.      To me, 'offensive' books, movies, and music are not bad, they are merely a stimulant for debate. They can allow you, rather than just the author, to express your feelings on what was presented in the works. But to completely remove the cometition of the debate would be sabotage. @PERSON2 @LOCATION1 that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' @CAPS5 saying this she is expressing that if we all could go into a library and remove the books, magazines, movies, or music that we do not like, then there would be absolutely nothing left. Every work would be remove because at least one person is offended @CAPS5 every work of the sort. Therefore, to allow books to be read, music listened to, and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances.      The censorship of any work, anywhere, is allowing for the 'shutting up' of ideas. These ideas are the ones that keep society going @CAPS5 making us think and helping to formulate our opinions. @CAPS5 allowing this we are creating future generations of great thinkers. In this case, @CAPS5 keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and utilize the information and ideas that have been used throughout history",4,4,4,2
4020,2,"I can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the book shelf. I hope our children or any other children take this book off the shelf because it would be offensive or demeaning to the race of me or the children. This book would probably make the children asks question that we don't really want to talk about.           This book would probably be a book I wouldn't recommend for my children to read or even look at the pages or cover of the book. I mean if it wasn' t demeaning to anybody's race or skin color I would let my children read it, but if it had like profanity and racial slurs in it I would tell my kids that this book is off limits until you are older.          Certain magazines such as like swimsuit models and other inappropriate stuff my children shouldn't be aloud to look at. Music is like the magazines if it has like profanity and talks about drugs then I'm not going to let my kids listen to it. Movies are just like magazines and music, if it has inappropriate stuff in it then my kids don't need to watch or listen to it. My exception for a movie is if it is rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, then they are aloud to watch it but if it is rated @NUM1 or @CAPS3 then my kids can forget about watching it.      So in the end, yes I can think of a book, movie, or magazine that I don't want my children or any children to get their hands on cause you never know what that could lead to. And if your a strict parent like I plan on being don't let your kids watch, look at, or listen to inappropriate stuff because that is just putting bad stuff in their brain.      I have to admit I have watched, listened to, and looked at some bad stuff but I regret it all so very much so.

4031,2,I dont thank so due to the fact that most libraries in towns and cities are open to the public.  if the person or persons find the peice of material offending then they should pass the item.  or they can skim over it.  on the other hand the person or persons does have the right to freedom of speech but should not exceed their opinion above the level of the law.       if music is played in the library that others do find offended then in my opinion yes they should and can speak up for their rights.  books and magazines should be allowed in the public library even if they feel offended.  this is due to the fact that it is a public library and there should be many many different kinds of books.  this is because people hav different personalities which mean we wll like different things.  that does not mean that others can not speak their opinion because like i said earlier every one in the united states of america has the right to speak what is on their mind even though it @MONTH1 not be what others want to hear they can still do it.     well that is my opinion on what i think should happen.,3,3,3,1

I like to go out and just pick a book right off the shelf and start then and there reading, but when I see a book or a magazine that holds sexual acts in them I become very anger.

Back in the late @NUM1's early @NUM2's parents saw some of the books that their children were reading. That tried to put a stop to it, but the plan never worked. Since then @CAPS3 problem has grown to a point that we will never be able to control. The libraries do @CAPS3 all for money they make. More people go to a library now not to study or to read in peace, but to get a sex high. @CAPS3 is where about  half of the libraries money is being made. The goverment tries to stay out of @CAPS3, because the money they get through taxes is coming of these people. When will it stop? No one really knows, but we will try to stop it all we can.     The reason for @CAPS3 essay was to show why the process needs to be stop. If you go to your local library and really look at what they sell or rent out, you will then know what I am saying.

4039,2,"Ever went to the library and seen a book that was to graphic for a certain section. When little kids came into the library does it seem like they should stay away from that section. Well censorship should be in librarys now a days. Many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age.  Due to seeing this they @MONTH1 get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life.     In librarys they have many books that are too mature for young children. They should have a restricted section in the librarys that only peolple of age or with parental guidance can pick books, movies, music, games, and magizenes from that section. For example, in video stores they have and adult section that only adults @MONTH1 enter not children. Librarys should be that same way but not with same material in video stores.     Personaly, I have seen children learning bad behaviors from video games, movies, and some books. While these children are young they do not know what is bad for them. So when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy harming other people they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves.     Librarys do need to take these books, movies, games, music, and magazines off of the shelves. If they do not then they should make a place children can not get ahold of these materals that can affect judgement. So when taking a younger child ta a library go in with and walk with them. It will save our kids of the next generation from violence and all other wrong doing habbits in these books, games, magazines, and music.     As long as there is not censorship in librarys our children will see these bahaviors and recreate them with other friends thinking thats its okay to do. Yes, once again I say censorship should be in librarys of any thing of certain age groups or if it is offencive. Do not let young kids walk alone in librarys so they can come across the wrong material for their age.",4,4,4,2
4040,2,"Books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. They have significent value in culture, lives, and everything else. We all see kids laughing and enjoying books about pretty ponies and little puppies. What we don't see is how books and magazines are really effecting people of different race, religion, or age. We should take a stand and get rid of these bad books. Negitive books, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelf to prevent hurt feelings and ideas.      We have learned to accept everybody no matter what color they are. I remember in @NUM1 grade when a girl named @PERSON1 got very upset because she thought a book was making fun of her skin color. Everyone in the book was white and excluded a african american girl from playing with them because she wasn't pretty enough. She went to tell the teacher and the teacher threw the book away and said that we should all learn to treat everyone with respect no matter what they look like. We need to have more books like what the teacher was trying to teach us. To boost everyones spirits and make them feel better about themselves. The world has changed and books should too.      Many things influence people of different ages, race, or religion. Books that talk bad about other religions or make you second guess your faith are considered negitive and should be taken off the shelf. How would you like it if someone was putting down your religion? That is how many people feel when reading that kind of material. These books, magazines, and movies are not good for anybody and should not be anywhere near libraries.      Have you been watching what your kids are reading about or what movies they are watching? Most of childrens books and movies have pretty princesses and little mermaids but not all of them. Behind some movies or books there is are violence and bad scenes. When fight scenes occur and zombies attack, children believe that everything is real and that it is ok to kill someone if they are a bad. Boys believe that it is ok to hurt people because that is what happens in the movies. Girls believe that everything about a princess is perfect and flawless and to be a princess they also have to be flawless. Do we really want childrent to think it is ok to fight and be upset because they are not perfect? Libraries need to get rid of these book and movies because it is badly influencing the children in the world.      Not all books are bad and not all of them are good, so we need to divide and conquer. We need to take a closer look and really examine what needs to be taken off the shelves. The books, magazines, and movies that influence people to think differently about themselves need to go away for good. To get rid of these books that cause conflict within a person is like getting rid of a big burden. It can make a really big improvment in adults and children. Please take negitive books and movies off the shelves to prevent any unnecessary problems!",3,3,3,1
4046,2,"Do you want your children to have bad images in their head? Does everybody deserve to read or watch anything they want? I believe strongly that these materials should be removed from libraries in most cases. Offensive materials have no business being in libraries. These materials are not good for children, offend people, and do not look good on the libraries that carry them.     First, I believe there is absolutely no reason for any child to see explicit material. This material can create a very ambitious young child. If a child sees a magazine containing pornography, the child will think that this material is acceptable. The truth is, that child should not know about anything of this subject until he or she receives approval from his/her parents. I know from experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very extensive time. I have had a few disturbing experiences myself. One time when I was a young lad, I checked out a horror movie from the local library not knowing what the movie was about. I made sure my parents were not home when I watched it. After about three minutes, I was terrified. The images from the film stayed in my head for a good month. Children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time.     Next, some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people. Large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics. We, as a society, do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released. In addition to that, this music offends many adults as well. Adults agree that there is no reason for any rap to be released in a public place like a library. Music is a very great art, but when certain people abuse it, it no longer has a good image. I have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual.     Also, some specific magazines contain images that are offensive to the people of our society. This idea relates to my first idea, but I will speak some of it again. Images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation. We do not need any of this. If offensive material was banned from libraries, our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world. I have been offended of some different magazine pictures before. Someday when I have kids, I will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this material.     Last, I want to address the fact that specific libraries can carry a bad reputation if they carry this material. In addition, employees will definitely go to a different library without the bad music and the violent movies. Most of the adults that want their children to be successful and have a good, creative mind will think twice about going to the library without censorship of certain items. I have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship. I know that if I was the manager of a public library, I would make sure that any items that have the potential to offend people would be immediately removed. A library should definitely not want that bad gossip to go around town about how bad that specific library is. Censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food. Shelves that contain inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only make their number of customers drop. If you think that this is only going to help libraries, I dare you to go ahead and try it out.      Everyone has their own opinions, but I am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries. Inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only destroy the good reputation that a library @MONTH1 have. A library is a great place to be, but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment. After all, it is your life, and you get to choose the way you want your children to act. Disturbing materials are only going to bring a negative effect on these minors. I hope to see the amount of censorship rise in libraries. If it does, people will see a dramatic change in all of my ideas discussed.",4,4,4,2
4048,2,"The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years. It has been discussed by many people, but a decision has never been reached. I say that there should be no library censoring. I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are.     I think that there should be no censoring of libraries. It would impair our basic rights. Such as our right to freedom of expression. And our right freedom to the press.We would no longer live in a free country but a totalterrian state.     Though if they would put an age restriction on certian things that @MONTH1 please the debators. I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed . Thus, if we did this children would only be able to read or listen to materials apporiate for their age.     Though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries. It's the parents who introducee the children to music, magazines, and books. If the parents started to censor these materials early on this debate would not be going on as it is.     The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years. Some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice. @PERSON1 said 'that if we have the right to censor libraries then thier will be no more books for any of us.",3,3,3,1
4052,2,"As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'  I think we all can agree with @CAPS2. We have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read.  I, however, believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth, or adults.  When you take away materials that some people use to learn, you take away their ability to learn.  Yes, they @MONTH1 choose another book and learn from it too but it should not be our choice to dictate what they can and can not read.Take for example the popular internet video clip, '@CAPS1 guys one hammer.'  @CAPS2 is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver.  I have never seen @CAPS2 movie and listening to my friends talk about it, I do not want to.  @CAPS2 seems like a gruesome and horrific video clip that would scar me for life, but it is a perfect example for @CAPS2 because what some do not want to learn from, others can.  I would never watch @CAPS2 or anything like @CAPS2 but my friends who have watched @CAPS2 have learned something. That is that you should be successful in life because if you are homeless then you could be beaten to death by some teenagers who are looking to have some 'fun.'  I kid you not, after hearing about @CAPS2 sad video it has inspired me to be a successful person and not become homeless. @CAPS2 brings us back to the main point - had someone said, 'No, @CAPS2 video can not be on the internet.' none of my friends would have seen @CAPS2 or told me about it.  Therefore I would not be driven to be a good student and a good person.  Then, when I was older I would have become homeless and would have had the chance to be the star in one of these videos. You can be sure that that is not something that I would want to be.In conclusion, I believe we should not interfere with some people's right to learn.  We should not take away materials that can be used to learn no matter how bad we think they are, because you never know, one man's pain is another man's learning tool. If we all took away the materials that we felt were innappropriate or needed censorship then we would have very few learning materials left.  As Katherine Paterson said, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'",3,4,3,1
4055,2,"Most of us have had times when we are really into a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us. Why did the author have to throw this in the book? Why didn't the back of the book tell me that there was offensive behavior in this book? Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures? It @MONTH1 even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library. Certain materials in libraries should be removed.     The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers. Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out. Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities. Your child on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews. If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset.     The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library. In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library. Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice, they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need. They @MONTH1 not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers. Not to mention, the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material.     The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that @MONTH1 be taken as offensive to a reader. That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them.     Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves. It will create a more civil trip to the library. No more worries about accidentely coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that is against someone's morals. Or flipping through pages in a magzine and seeing a picture that offends you. Libraries will contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves. It's a win win situation.",4,4,4,2
4065,2,"There are many libraries with many books, magzines,music, and movies.  Some of the things in a library are inappropiate for children. So the library makes a section for the adult's and a section for the children. There should just be a children library and then make another library for the adult's.  Then I also think that they should take the bad things of the shelf's at libraries.     So there are children books and there adult books. In most libraries I seen that they either have and upstairs for the adult's and they have a downstairs for the kid's.  They also have toy's down there for kids so if there parents want to go upstairs then the kids can sit there and play with the toy's.      Then I also think that they should take off the bad things on the shelf's.  Becuase wjat happens if a kid goes up with there mom or dad and opens a book and sees something very inappropiate?  So they should be taken off the shelve's in a library, and if someone wants to buy them then will have to go online or to the store and buy them.       The people that own the liobrary or are in the library should take all the bad magazines, music, books, and ect. off the shelf's. It is a very bad thing to have at a public place, and that should not be aloud.  The public libraries should take all the inappropriate things of the shelf's",3,3,3,1
4069,2,"Have you ever went to a library and found that some books arn't really the best choice for younger kids to be reading? Well I am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what I think is best for younger children to be reading.          I have went to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way to extreme for kids to be reading/watching. I personaly think that children who arn't above @CAPS5 years old shouldn't be exposed of rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @NUM1 books, movies, or magazines. Children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age @NUM2. What I think kids should watch or read are @CAPS2 movies and books.           Some of you are probly like 'but it's not like there going to know what it means.' @CAPS4 if children don't know what something means then that deffinantly won't stop them from saying it. Children learn by hands on or watching other things. They will eventually ask what does this mean or mommy what does this word mean. No parent is ready to tell there child at the age of three what a four letter word means. If you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child then thats when you can bring out the older books/movies. But don't let them read it on there own. Usually kids will start asking about more adult things when the hit the age @CAPS5 and up. Thats when you as a parents can start letting them read and watch older movies and books.          Tweleve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on there own. Thats when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on. As a kid we look up to our parents. We learn from seeing what you guys do. That is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten. At the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect. They know what is happening and they know how to handel it.           In conclusion I think that rated @CAPS1 books, magazines and movies should be kept above ages one-@CAPS5. I think that kids will be better off learning about things that they need to know by the time middle school starts. Then once they hit highschool they will already know about what becoming an adult is all about",4,3,4,2
4070,2,"Many books, movies, and magazines are made for the different age groups of adults and children.  I do agree that certain books are not approperiate for some children.  Is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries?  Authors create books and stories because they like the idea, and students can wright what we want on paper because it's what we want it's called freedom.  Schools can try to be creative and have a way to only allow books to the approperate age groups.     Books are a great part of a students learning.  Parents need to learn, and understand no matter how much they don'@CAPS1 like it that they can'@CAPS1 protect their children from the world some day they will be moved out of the house supporting themselves.  How would childern and teens even know how to live or what and how to react to hearing a bad word or watching sexual on @CAPS1.V.  If students never know how will they live.       Books can be learning in many ways.  Some things a teenager might be experiencing a parent might not want to talk about with their child.  Maybe the family can'@CAPS1 afford to buy a pass to the public library. So the only other option is the school library books.  If students can'@CAPS1 have access to then whats the option for them?  Everyone knows how today's society is changing, if a student wants to learn about sex or @ORGANIZATION1's they should be able to if the age is approprite.     All libraries check out books so the book is under a name.  I know at our school students just come in and take the books instead of checking them out, but some students do still use the card and check the book out.  If schools had books that our for only a certain age group a soultion to getting the older students to check them out and only the right age could be the books are in a case that is locked up.  So for the student to have the book unlocked and checked they have an electronic key to unlock books for the age group they are in. When the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get.  Books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by  parents.",4,4,4,2
4071,2,"Censorship in libraries? In my opinion I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored. I'm not a person that does much reading but I do know of some books, magazines, and movies that are filled with perfanity. In my opinion that is just the authors way of how he or she wanted to do it.      I believe that libraries should keep these type of materials on the shelves but have them in sections maybe. Taking them off the shelves would be disrespectful to the authors/producers. That is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment! Maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone...Well listen, there are heeps and heeps of books out there you can find that are not bad!      If you are more of the movie type of person but also do not like the cursing or nudity, there are plenty of movies out there that are very innocent! I hate when I sit down to watch a movie with the family and then all of sudden the actors start throwing around the @CAPS1 word and half naked women appear. But if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie. One that is more family oriented and safe for children eyes.     So just because there are some materials that are out there with all sorts of fowl language and indecent human behaviors doesn't mean you should ban them from the libraries. If some people want to fill their mind with filth, let them. But for you who do not, get other stuff. Simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch. Be a role modle and teach them about healthier viewings",4,3,4,2
4075,2,"Did your child ever bring home a book? A piece of music, movie or magazine? Did you ever stop to think that the piece of information that your child was bringing home could be offensive to someone else?     There are points in time where there isn't an answer to that question and you dont want to chose yes or no. The driving question is do you want to remove books, music, movies and magazines from the shelf, just because a parent thinks that its not fit for a child to be reading. Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shel. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that I work abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 point in this quotation is that if you take a book off the shelf everytime that someone doesnt think that its right for children to see, then there will be no books left to see.      In agreement to Katherine, parents @MONTH1 want the best for their children, but there are reasons to why you should agree with the average parent and then there are reasons to why you shouldn't. There are books out amongst the world that only adults should see, and their are also books out there that are way too advance to be read by children. These books are all made for a reason and have there own purpose on why they are put there. Parents have to sit back and think of their children and then think of the rest of the world, its a big world and you cant just take things away from it. No matter how much you want to protect a child from the point of seeing the books that are meant for older age ranges, there isnt a way that you can stop it.      I think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for. There is no reason that because one person doesn't agree with the way that someone has written that book, it should be taken off the shelf just for that child. Libraries cant just start taking books off the shelf for individual mothers that dont like this or dont like that. Many people come from many different areas and see things in a different perspective, they dont know the difference between right and wrong.      It's a bigger world out there than you and me. When one person tries to stand against the world, they're going to get knocked down. So why fight when the world was meant to be at peace?",3,3,3,1
4080,2,"Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated,      ' All of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer.     The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today.      Another  important reason why library censhorship is wrong is that material that one person @MONTH1 find to be offensive @MONTH1 not be ofensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of      @CAPS1, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories  or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people @MONTH1 be able to look back on these events both now and in the future.        In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrigh the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material @MONTH1 be to them",4,3,4,2
4081,2,"Do believe that any boook or form of literature should be removed from a library just because someone takes it into offense? No, it should not be removed. That person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book. They have a problem with the book, not everyone else if the book was good enough to be published that means someone wants to read the book which means they would make others who want the book upset over their own opinion.       In the words of Katherine Paterson, a famous author, she says,'All o fus can think of a book that we hope none of uor children or any children have taken off the shelf. But i fI have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries. If we shall let everyone choose to take these materials off the shelf then we might as well have no books, music, movies, magazines, etc at all because someone somewhere will always not like the material.     If someone finds something offensive they should simply stay away from it. Everyone has their own view of everythings they come across which means if you hate something, your neighbor might love it. So simply because the boo or other form of material offend you that doesn't mean that its worth taking off the shelves of libraries and book stores.     Don't get me wrong I believe in some forms of censorship. I just don't believe in people taking their opinion and choosing whether a certain piece of literature or music can be in our libraries. I just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their book, novels, poems, etc.      I believe that if something is offensive to you that's your opinion and there's an easier way to not hav eyour children read the than getting the book removed, just don't bring the book to your children stay away from the book as much as possible. If you @MONTH1 come across it just don't acknowledge it. Your children are more at risk of being in a carcrash then reading a nonapropriate book only if you teach them correctly, not to sound harsh but to shine reality on the fact. That is why I do not believe in censorship in libraries nor bookstores",4,3,4,2
4082,2,"Dear sir or mam,      Have you or someone in your family ever read a book, magazine, or watched a movie that was taken to be offensive? Do you or that person think that it would make a difference if that one book, book or movie was removed from the shelves? Would removing every  book, cd, movie or magazine  from shelves that were to have a great or small amount of racism, violence, bad language and other inappropriate things be helping the community? Do you believe that its everyone's decision whether or not those things should be removed from the shelves?     I believe that alot of people in our community have read a book in their lifetime that they considered to be the slightest bit offensive to them. I bet people all over the world have read offensive books. But the only types of people that those books, movies or magazines would affect would be teenagers and kids. But at the time they wouldn't see it as offensive, they would think that it was cool and interesting and they would want to read or watch it over and over again until they were to get bored of it then they would gone back the library and get another one.           I think in a way it would and would not make a difference whether or not they were removed from the shelves. Because if only that one book, movie or magazine was removed from the shelves then the person that got it removed would move on from that book,magazine or movie and find plenty more of them that would be more or equally offensive. If every people were to remove every book that they were to find offensive then other people who would enjoy them that certain thing wouldn't beable to obtain it.If everyonewere to find all kinds different books, movies or magazines offensive and got them removed from the shelves then their wouldn't be very much left for the community.     In conclusion I believe that every individual has their opinion and own way of thinking when it comes to what is and is not offensive. I think it is not just up to them on what should be on the shelves in a library, but the communities choice. If someone wants a good book,magazine, or movie they should ask suggestions from a friend or family member on what they should get. If they can't get any suggestions on what they should get they should just what they think is interesting ignore the offensive parts",4,3,4,2
4083,2,"Have you ever wanted something removed from the shelves of a library because you thought it was offensive? If so, how did you go about the situation and what did you want done about it? I know in my experiences I have found some things that were offensive, so I am sure that they are out there. I think there are so many rules, qualifications, or standards that can give someone reason to take something off a shelf, and those can be different for everyone.      If you were in a children's library or a school library, I am sure most people would agree that any book with offensive language, situations, opinions, etc. should be removed from the shelves. Now if you were in a public library in the teenage or adult section and those same books that were inappropriate for the children's library are in the teenage or adult section, that might be admissable. The audience is different; therefore, the types of literature, music, movies, etc. can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial. Part of why something should come off of a shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it.     In my opinion, there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature. @CAPS1 is one reason why I think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature. Although, I also think there should be guidelines, and perhaps rules, on what should be allowed on shelves and what should not because some things might be on the edge of the line, but depending on what it is it can be, for example, a learning tool or great read.     As Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 is why I think there should be guidelines or rules. If everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf, there might not be anything left to read or listen to. Different things are offensive to different people. If there were rules or guidelines, that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future.     I think there should be censorship in libraries. Some pieces of work are just too offensive, and they need to be taken off the shelves. I think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created. As Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'",4,4,4,2
4086,2,"Parents are responsible for their child, whether it's taking them to school, making sure their grades are up or even watching what their child reads. Libraries should not remove 'offensive' books, magazines, movies, etc. That is the parents reponsibility, it's the library's.      The library is a place to go when you want to get a book or a movie or a magazine, ect. Whether it's for enjoyment or research. That book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read. If we took out all the material in the library that some people, in there oppion, found offensive, then there wouldn't be very many books left in the library. Who is to choose if the books were offensive anyhow? If an adult or mature teenager went to the library to look for a book and it wasn't there because they took it off the shelves because parents couldn't watch their child pick out a book? Or even teach them that those books are wrong.      The parents have full responsibiliy if their child is reading something that is inapropriate in their eyes. How would the library know which books to take off the shelf because all parents have different ideas of what is right and wrong. If the kid is young, the parent would be the one taking their child to the library, so they could easily watch which book, magazine, or movie they're picking out. Most libraries have a children's section anyway.     It is not the library's responisbility to watch out for your child, it's the parents. Their job is to supply the community with books, movies, magazines, etc. Libraries should keep the books on the shelvles so people from all over can enjoy any book they would like to read.",3,3,3,1
4089,2,"I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive.                                                                                                     People shouldn't let what is in books bother them. The way I see @CAPS4 is, if the book offends you, then don't read @CAPS4. There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive. I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4.     @CAPS4 would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything. Like for instance, music. if we had a library for @CAPS1 music, @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for. Same thing with movies and magazines. The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses.     Back to the point. I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back. Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive? Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway. If you know what kind of book your looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive.     Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad. Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive. I've said @CAPS4 before, and I'll say @CAPS4 again. If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be.     Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people. I mean, let's face @CAPS4, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate. They're are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse. Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2, @CAPS4 could be bad. That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs.     I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, @CAPS4's music, not books.     I've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said. books are books, they're offensive to some people, and to some people, they're not. In the end, @CAPS4's all a matter of opinion",4,4,4,2
4090,2,"I believe that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offends you. People shouldn't be able to disarm that material off of the shelf. If it's there children they're worried about just teach them from staying away from adult section. Also, some people don't like foul language but thats there opinion. Than we wouldn't have any material left in the library if everyone had the rights to disarm offensive material. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us' (Paterson).     If it's your children your worried about seeing censorship in libraries but, you don't mind it just have them stay in the kids section reading books. You could just go a day where you want to go by yourself so you don't have to worry about your kids spotting any censorship. Before checking the material out skim through it make sure there is nothing offensive for your child.      Many people don't like foul language but, that's there opinion. It doesn't bother me because it gives the book a little taste and it's more interesting. Helps you understand what the reader is feeling upon someone or thing. Sometimes it helps show what mood the reader has in the story.     Finally, if everyone had the right to disarm all the offensive materials, we wouldn't have anything left. This could effect peoples education and reading skills. Some of that material is peoples hobbies they wouldn't be able to do what they like anymore.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off of the shelf '(Paterson). It's an easy fix just teach your children from right and wrong. Would you rather have your children have a good education or not know how to read? Many people dislike foul language but it could make the book better. I don't know what I would do if there was no more books. Well these are examples of why people shouldn't have the rights to disarm material off of the shelf if it offends them. What would you do if you had something you loved taken away from you?",3,4,3,1
4093,2,"There are all kinds of different people in the world. People with different views on things, people with strong opinions, people who are very outspoken and mature and alot of those people are authors of the hundreds of books that fill our libraries at school. Some schools censor certain books from schools because they think the tone or message is inappropriate or too violent, but I believe that we have a right to these books.     In my opinion no book should be censored from the library. We have troops fighting for our freedom of press and freedom of speech and censoring books completely ignores these wonderful freedoms our country has given us. During my freshman year we read a book called '@CAPS1 @NUM1' and before we read it our teacher told us a little bit about what it is about. She said the book was about the way a society had banned books like they were drugs or something that could hurt us. Now apparently a school didn't like the idea of a society banning all books so they banned this book from being read to their children.  Now if you actually read this book they portray how bizzare and crazy this would be to have all books banned but here we are banning a book about banned books! Does this make any sense?      To be honest by the time you are in high school you have probably seen, heard, and done crazier stuff than what people put in the 'banned books'. Now I know there are some people who would say just because you do things that you should not be doing in the first place does not mean you @CAPS2 to read about it all the time and fill your head with ideas about it, and I agree on some level because most of the stuff high schoolers do they shouldn't, but thats life, plain and simple. In my opinion, high schoolers really are mature enough to handel some offensive language or violent scenes because I'm sure they see worse stuff on the televison or sometimes in their own homes. One of my good friends is @NUM2 years old, has two jobs, her own apartment with her boyfriend, and is not supported by either of her parents. Now this girl still goes to high school and has great grades and is obviously very mature for her age but yet even she is not allowed to read a book with some offensive language in it.      I think our society 'babies' us a little to much because when we get out into the real world things are not going to be censored or kept quiet. I think high schools @CAPS2 to put these books into the libraries because it might help some kids grow up and become more mature. When we go into the work place after college and start our lives with careers, homes, and families we @MONTH1 be to immature to deal with it and I know some people who are! Censored books are just a way to keep the way we live life quiet to some people and never let kids grow up and experience things.     We have a right to these books just like the people who write them have a right to do so. If they can publish them, then we should be able to read them no matter what our age is",4,4,4,2
4097,2,"@PERSON1 is saying we shall all share then never giving @CAPS4 back. Also we can't all get what we want at the sametime or at all. If that book is popular then they should of bought more to sell for the other people that doesn't have the book and would like to have @CAPS4.      Of course sharing is better then wasting your money on something when someone has the book that you know and would let you barrow @CAPS4. And yes, We all know that most people these days don't usually share.      To tell you the truth you don't always get what you want. Either get over @CAPS4.      Yea @PERSON2 has a @CAPS1 but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion.     We all don't have to listen to what other's say but if you agree with that person then you agree.      Like I said everybody has there own opinion and I stated mine.Pretty much like '@CAPS1 OF @CAPS2.'      No, I do not believe that books,music, and etc. should be taken off the shelves because @CAPS3 @CAPS4's stupid you'll lose your job and @CAPS5 people out there in the world need something to do @CAPS6!?     I don't read I mostly listen to music because I think music to me is more interesting and entertaning then reading a book. I mean yea I read articles from magazines but like I said mostly listen to music.     Reading a book is mostly like someone telling you a story about so and so or somthing . So to me @CAPS7 book is in infront of @CAPS7 face @NUM1. '@CAPS7 life'     @CAPS8 later on in @CAPS7 life I will be interested in reading a book but now I'm enjoying @CAPS7 life being a teenager.     So basically I'm telling you @CAPS7 own opinion and I think @CAPS4's completely stupid for being graded for this because everybody has there own opinion just saying.     You could either agree or disagree but for this @CAPS4's mostly a disagree",2,2,2,0
4102,2,"I believe that the children of today should be able to read, and learn the same things that our parents have learned in the past. Learning things through the same teachings, books, movies... etc.      Learning things this way would be better then taking out cussing, swaring and certain detailed writing, because if you took all that away its like lieing about history, and what really happend.     Should the children of today be deprived of the truth? Would you want your children going to school everyday and learning things from a text book that were twisted around just so that it was apropriate and non offencive? Think about it... Were you deprived of learning history when you were in school? I didn't think so, so why start now?     Say your child is going to be reading '@ORGANIZATION1' in @CAPS1 class today. Would you want to ruin a classic book by taking the '@CAPS2' word and the word 'slave' out of the book? Depriving them of how there use to be slave owners, slaves, and racial comments? Depriving them of actual history? Would you also deprive them from learning about wars, revolutions, and mass killings just to make learning apropriate?     No. I wouldn't. I would want my children learning anything and everything about world history. I do not think that there should be censorship in libraries",4,4,4,2
4104,2,"There are thousands of books in libraries now a days, some are from @NUM1 years ago. Books are books, and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf. Books, music, movies and magazines are all mad to interest people and what they enjoy reading. Authors and publishers should not be pentalized for their hard work they achieved.      There are many people in the world, who like all different types of books. But just because a book has censorship inside the story doesn't mean any human being will enjoy the story. I enjoy reading stories about romance, and I'm sure there is censorship inside a romance story.     I only prefer romance stories, and if every single romance story had censorship and libraries removed the books from the shelves, I wouldn't read any type of book. Because I only enjoy reading about the romance. I only find adults and young adults reading romance stories, and these people have the matureness not to act out about censorship.     It's not best to ruin the stories for adults and young adults who like to read about the censorship inside of stories. There many be people who find it so interesting, that if it's based on a true story then they would want to be willing to help the person out based on the situation.      Don't take away the chance for these authors to succeed more in life. Let these young adults read about everything they are interested in. I'm sure there are many different people who would be upset if the censored stories were eliminted from the shelves in libraries",3,3,3,1
4105,2,"Censorship, only for the light hearted.      We have had this issue for as long as man can remeber. Since we were only little kids to adults. Everything was censored. Bleeps on the television to hide harmless words to random letters in curse words as if we did not know for example what @NUM1k spelt. I agree, censorship is needed for a certain period of time, but when that time goes on for to long and even in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle, that's when it goes out of hand.      I am a highschool student and even I have to say limiting our reading because a book might have one or two bad words in it is just redicoulous. Its the most hipocritical thing to do because even science and anatomy books show certain parts of the body like genitalia but thats okay because its in a science book. However if its in a normal book, everythings a big deal and we can't handle it big woop. I say its a library, let us read what we want to read.     Like i said before highschool is where the maturity hits and the censorship should be lowered. Im not saying just completly take it away but come on now I think highschool student can handle a few bad words in an outstanding book.      As far a movies and music go, anything pornographic or just plain idiotic and demeaning should ofcourse be censored, but if theres just a few bad words why should that stop an entire school from enjoying some good music and possibly an amazing movie.      So the point is, let there be censorship, but only to the point where people wont just take away music and books from us highschoolers for a few bad words. Censorship is for the lighthearted, and nothing is stopping the lighthearted people from not picking up that book with a few words in it they don't like, just dont read it. Thats all I have to say about censorship.",3,3,3,1
4106,2,"Read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 ?     Books, music, and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them. In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 the things that let us do so. These things keeps us all occupied when theres alot of time to spare. The library is a place where you can go read in peace and @CAPS1 to music with no distractions or anything, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library.          People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it. Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies. And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching.           Genre comes in all kind of different types. For example, theres only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only. Theres also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a childs hand or vision. Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand.     All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library. In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else. Honestly all media actually should have their own section. For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section.          All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read. A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection. So books should stay where they belong and not tooken down from any self, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media",3,3,3,1
4108,2,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     @CAPS1 I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple.  For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing.  Their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then.  With a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about.  But @CAPS1 does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence?  By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development.  However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book,  that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate.     Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust.  A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice.  Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work.  Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society.  Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended.     Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race.  Even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination.  Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is.  Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 save authors from repeating such dishonorable content.  In other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'.  By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature.  @CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature.  All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret.     Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature?  A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 be sacred to a @CAPS5.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message.  A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person.  If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests.  The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group.     Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate.  Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them.  Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes.  And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself.  Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent.                                   -@ORGANIZATION2",6,6,6,3
4109,2,"There are many different perspetives on censorship in our country.  This is the human race, opinionative that is.  Different perspectives come from different people: young, old, parents, and children.  In libraries there are some reading materials, that some @MONTH1 find offensive.     Offensive material in libraries is @CAPS1 directed to be read by young children.  They are also @CAPS1 inteded to be able to get there hands on such material.  Even though this is @CAPS1 the purpose of that material, it happens that this material ends up in the hands of someone who shouldn't have it.  No the material is @CAPS1 held under lock and key, but it is also @CAPS1 left to lay at a child high shelf that would seem appealing to them.     The problem with removing all of this material from libraries would result in empty shelfs, except for the children's books.  The material that would have to be removed are books meant for people of the appropriate age group to inform and tell good stories.  If we protected children from censhorship this would deny knowledge, and also a get away for some, from the general public that anually go to the library.\     @CAPS1 all movies, books, music, and other materials are labeled as they should be.  Some material @MONTH1 @CAPS1 be appropriate for children, but they also are @CAPS1 all inappropriate.  A rated '@NUM1' movie @MONTH1 be just like a rated '@CAPS2' movie only with one extra reference, that @MONTH1 be taken in the wrong way.  Even protective parents @MONTH1 allow their children to view movies like this as long as they find it appropriate.     Libraries should @CAPS1 remove this material from their shelves.  If it is that much of an issue, then they could have the children books in a seperate room of the library.  There are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children.  All of which do @CAPS1 have the need of removing these books and other materials from the libraries' shelves.     Censorship in libraries is a contraversial subject.  There is a very good arguement on either side of whether or @CAPS1 to take offensive material off of shelves in the libraries.  I believe it should @CAPS1 be taken off and there are alternatives to this.  This essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone",4,4,4,2
4111,2,"Have you ever been in that situation where you couldn't read a book because of someone else having bitter feelings towards it? Are you furious when you finally get a chance to read that book you've been waiting on for two months and all of a sudden it's not to your avalible because of its content? I know I always amd because at @ORGANIZATION1 this happens quite often. I believe that a book shouldn't be removed because only one person found it to be offense. Sure some novels @MONTH1 expose a few word of profanity or discrimination but everyone has to deal with it. So why take one book off the shelf for saying something vaulger because not everyone might dislike the book. If we took a book off the shelf everytime someone reported a bad word or a discrimitive remark then we would be left with no books including the ones that tell us a great deal about past history.     Some authors, movie directors and artist rely on history to help them create a great piece of reading, comentary, or lyrics. If the libraries in the public and in schools censored everything there could be a @ORGANIZATION1 risk of loosing alot of historic and epic material or information from the past. As im sure you know alot of history books about the holucaust, slavery, and the civil rights movement include words that people of certain genders or races @MONTH1 find offensive. These words are a vital source in the attempt to explain what the people in those situations are going through; therefore those words shouldn't be reported for histories sake.     I know im not alone in my fight to keep books on the shelf because an author named Katherine Paterson says, ' ... If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same righ and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). In this quote she is trying to say if people abuse this policy there will be no books left on the shelf for anyone to read becasue someone found something offensive to them. This is what will eventually happening if we don't censor the @CAPS1 in the libraries.     Now don't mistake me for someone who believes that @CAPS1 should be dropped all together becasue I believe it is needed in some cases. If there is a song that use profanity multiple times without any logical reasoning then it shouldn't be availible to the public through a library. Also if there are inappropriate movies I don't think that they should be distributed by the library to the public becasue thats what movies rental stores are for. On the other hand I haven't found a single book that isn't suitable for the library; so why are there so many books being takin away every year due to what some people call '@CAPS1' also known as  self opinions?     In this writing my goal was accomplished; I wanted to let everyone know that the whole @CAPS1 thing is getting a little out of hand. We all know that there is some offensive things that @MONTH1 be happening but they are things that everyone who views that book, movie, or soundtrack has to deal with. With some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that @MONTH1 contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across. I know that @CAPS1 is just another way of looking out for the better of humans but alot of it has a reason. The only case where @CAPS1 should be used is in innapropriate movies and songs with no hisrtoric purpose. With all that has been said, do you still believe in all of the @CAPS1 going on in your nearby library? How can you help prevent the destruction of all of the historic words in libraries?",4,4,4,2

4116,2,"What should and should'nt be censored in a library really is just a matter of opinion from the people using the library. If everyone were to removed what they didnt like from the shelves of a library then much information would be less acceceble to the general public. Although some people @MONTH1 be offended by some forms of literature, this doesnt mean that the literature should be removed from everyone. I beleive a solution must be made to satisfy everyone.     Currently, some people arent happy with some of the books, music, movies, and magazines that are available at many libraries. They believe that the information @MONTH1 be unsuitable for some veiwers. Some people just do not want certain information getting in the minds of children.     While that is a very solid reason to censor what goes into our libraries; there are others who dissagree with the thought of censoring our libraries. By allowing the censoring of libraries it would decrease the amount of information available to the public. If parents allow their children to take out certain materials without first checking whats behind the cover, then the parents have noone to blame but themselves.     I believe that this could all be resovled by simply having parents fill out a form before allowing their children to get a library card. This form would include a list of things that they would want to prevent their kids from checking out such as: swearing in books and music, nudity in movies and magazines. This information would be put with the cerial number of the library card. If their child were to checkout something that is restricted on the list, the librarian would tell them to put the book back and pick another book.     I can see how censorship is very useful and important. Although sometimes it can be takin a bit to the extreme. There is a solution out there, but we just need to find it.",4,4,4,2

Yes there are some very offincive items in a library, such as a book about racism to african americans. No, that person who takes offince in those itmes does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all. The library is open to any and or everybody.      Lets suppose you have a young child, and you take him/her to the public library with you. As your looking for a book the child reaches to the highest book that he/she can reach, pulls it off the shelf and it lands on the floor open. You look down to see what had happened and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right infront of your child. Thats your own fault, not the librarys.     Although many times its not the librarys fault where certain books are at, you should be more responsible and check out the area in which you are looking.      I think there should be a select area for which the 'inappropriate material' should be kept. And for a person to get into the select area they must show a membership type of identification, and sign a waver saying the material they have checked out will cause no trouble nor take offince to anybody in which the customer is around.

4130,2,"I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpfull place. Who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develope a lot of problems. Muisc can be straight offensive.      If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is raciest, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an affect on you. You @MONTH1 not realise that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a differant race. If a person isn't raciest and they see something that is, it could offend them. They @MONTH1 feel like they 'cool'. They go out and say raciest things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technicly bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries.      Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie.They @MONTH1 not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They @MONTH1 go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These moives can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it.      In magizines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magizines. If you see @PERSON1 in a magizine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. Its normal for someone to be jeleous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We @MONTH1 starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. Into today's society, people stive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stair. We use the girls in the magizine to helps us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magizines can be offensive.      In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head everytime you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realise that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just beeing a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self harm. Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society. Their is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut theirselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries.      We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is ment to be a good place. Anyone can go their. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of.",4,4,4,2
4133,2,"With the world having a wide variation of cultures, languages, beliefs, and races, there is no doubt that different subjects will be offensive to some and not to others. Books, songs, magazines, and movies all have purposes as to why they were created. This @MONTH1 be to entertain, inform, or persuade. People use libraries as a source to see these works. Many people use libraries every day to research or simply to gain knowledge for fun. My opinion is that any type of material, no matter what it contains, should be able to be found on a library shelf. A library is a place where one should be able to find a book, cd, video, or magazine or any subject that interests them.     If our libraries took out every item that was offensive to someone, there would simply be no library. Any item you read or listen to will have a word, sentence, or meaning that will offend a person in some way. This is because many of the items you will find will be in some way biased. The way an author tries to entertain @MONTH1 offend you if they use a certain language with a certain tone. Persuasion is also biased towards one side and you @MONTH1 not agree with the side the author chooses. The same goes with informing. You @MONTH1 think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did. All of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone. I once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers. The article was obviously biased and did not have any teen sources to prove that not all teen drivers are bad. This article deeply offended me, but I am glad I read it and saw a different point of view. Not everyone wants to see the different points to a story, but if you happen to run across one of these items that offend you, you can simply put it back down on the shelf. You are not required to read or listen to any item that you do not want to see or hear. However, there is going to be someone who needs to use that item for personal knowledge or for research. This is why all items need to be available to the public. If someone does find an item offensive though, they should be able to request that a label be put on the item to further warn other readers. Likewise, if there is an item rated '@CAPS1' there needs to be an age limit set to protect our young readers and listeners. With these changes set, our libraries could make everyone happy.     With libraries being found in most communities, there is going to be discussion on the contents of the items they carry. While you @MONTH1 like a book, I @MONTH1 find it offensive. Even though I @MONTH1 have a problem with an item, it still needs to be able to be accessed by all people. The point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public. It is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants. Any item, whether biased or not, should be able to be found on the shelves of a library. Those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests him. We need to be able to go to a library and find what we need or want to see or hear. This is how a library serves a community",4,4,4,2
4137,2,"In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, there consists of many libraries that are available to the public with an interminable amount of information. All of this information gives us many opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take. Byt what if some of this information has a bad influence in our world? What if some of this information changed the persective of peoples' lives, and who people are? Libraries do contain offensive and provokative books, movies, and other things that can possibly be hurtful to the behavior standpoint of all human beings. Censorship in libraries should be established and set because the people in the @LOCATION1 come from many different places making the @LOCATION1 very diverse. One thing in a book @MONTH1 not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else. Magazines, movies, books, etc. should be examined and determined whether it is appropriate for people at certain @CAPS1 whether by building a child section for books and movies and such, or having knowledgable assistance to help what people are looking for.     Sections in libraries organizes the library providing and easier access to where things are located. In libraries, there are search engines to help people find information in a particular location. The benefit of having sections divided depending on people's @CAPS1 is that it seperates the mature section from the immature section appose to having both in one. Children normally have a seperate section for children books while older and more mature adults or teenagers have a section to gather their important information from. An example of a bad situation would be if their was a book located in the childrens section that spoke about drugs and alcohol. The children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are. They could learn bad things about it and children tend to think they are invisible drawing them to try anything or everything that could possibly be life-taking. This is common sense. Sections in libraries do help establish a sense of organization, although personal assistance would be helpful as well.     Personal assistance and help on finding information in libraries is very helpful although they must be mature, understand, and know that their are books in libraries that could be about offensive material. Asssistance can help us determine if the person that is looking for information about something and there is inappropriate stuff inside the book, the assistant can let the person know about it. Because there is an interminable amount of information, I believe that there will be books left on the shelf for many people to learn about. Everytime I visit a library, there are always books on the shelves, and when I ask for assistance, they help me find what I am looking for. They warn me about offensive or provokative imagery and such and help me with upmost respect. Assistance can help prevent any sort of confusion with books, movies, etc. Assistants are ready to help people find what they are looking for and warn the people and are knowledgable about the offensive things that are in each book, movie, etc.      Personally, I believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries. Writers and authors write about information that is fact or also opinion, and typically people learn about subjects that people enjoy or want to discover. Censorship in libraries is necessary to let people know about it, although assistance do not have the right to not let anyone read a particular book because it is inappropriate or provokative. Everyone in the @LOCATION1 has the right to read whatevery they please. Some measures must take place for example towards minors because otherwise it could lead to issues or disasters, but there should not be a law that prohibits a child from reading something. There is no such thing as a book that should be thrown out because every word that comes out out of peoples' mouthes are useful no matter how rediculous it is. Even if it is the most rediculous thing you ever heard, that particular person that said something made you think about it and that thought process helped you make a decision in your life that was next to come. This would be more on opinion based writing. In factual righting, it is something that remains in peoples' heads and is saved into the brain like a word document. This document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive. Offensive factual information is hurtful to some although it is fact meaning it happened or is true.This brings me to my persepective on the matter that I think there should be a sense of censorship within reason although everyone has the right to read whatever they please because there is a never ending amount of information in the world and that information, including opinion, would make the shelves be empty from books",4,4,4,2
4142,2,Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves.     I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying.     I don't really read alot because im picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. Alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life. Which I can understand why someone would want to escape.     Movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on. Which makes it more entertaining than a book. So more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is.     So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it. Like i said everyone is different. So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well?,4,4,4,2
4143,2,"As a teenager I am trying to grow and find my way in life and find ways to express myself. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines ect.. should be censored in libraries. Everyone has their own opinion on things such as the music we listen to or the books we read. I do believe that younger children like middle schoolers/preschoolers should be censored from violent songs and movies, but for highschoolers and older I think that it should be our choice. I think that if the libraries really believe that a book or magazine is truely offensice they shouldn't allow them to be published. Not everyone is going to like every book or every type of music that is out there. We should be able to get the books that we like from libraries. Like Katherine Paterson said ' And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries are able to remove books music ect.. because they believe they are offensive there would be no books left for us to read or songs for us to listen to.I believe that highschoolers and older should be able do decide for themselves what kind of books they read or music they listen to. If you dont like a certain type of music dont listen to it, if you dont like the way a book is written, dont read it. No one is making you to read or listen to something that you dont want to. Books that @MONTH1 be offensive to some @MONTH1 be eye oppening to another. In books we learn about war and things that I fing gruesome and unnessisary, but sometimes it is a fact of life and the things we might find offensive in books are usually things that are happening in real life.I do believe that younger children should be censored form books and music that might be offensive, because they are not big enought to know what is right or wrong, and they dont know what to do with violent information in books about war and music with cussing. In conclusion, I believe that libraries should only censor books that are found offensice to parents with younger children and in younger sections of libraries.",3,3,3,1
4145,2,"Freedom to chose is something every person can have, such as what type of clothes you wear.  Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because everyone should have that right to chose.  Plus, there are other ways to avoid children getting inappropriate books besides taking the books completely out of the library.  Censorship in libraries should not happen because if someone is eighteen, they should have the right to chose what they want to watch anyways, the parents can censor what books and movies they want there kids to read and see, and there are offensive things and inappropriate things on television that everyone has access to as well.     First of all, if a person is eighteen they should have a right to read whatever books they chose because they are grown adults.  Eighteen year olds can go into rated @CAPS1 movies which would be about as bad as a book most likely.  In our society, people that are eighteen can do almost whatever they chose because they have freedom.  For example, adults can look up whatever they chose on the internet, and so can everyone else of all ages.  So, if they wanted to read a book like that, they could probably get it off the internet, even if they can not in libraries.  Therefore with today's technologies, censorship would not make a difference.     Next, there are ways to avoid children reading inappropriate books besides taking the books off the shelves completely.  For instance, if parents are so worried about their children reading inappropriate books, then they should take their kids to the library themselves and tell their kid what they can and can not read.  If parents do not censor what their child reads, then those parents @MONTH1 want the child to read whatever he/she choses to.  If their parents chose to let their kid read the book, then that is their choice, not anybody elses.  The choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child.     Lastly, there are so many things in the world that could be offensive to other people besides a book.  For example, people offend other people all the time by words they say.  People hear about all of the fighting because the person probably was offended by something someone else said.  Also there is the television.  The television has inappropriate shows on it all the time, yet everyone can have access to it if they chose to.  Plus there are shows on television that could have to do with racism, or someone being overweight.  These things offend people every day.  Therefore, we should not take books off the shelves just because there is a possiblity of offending someone, when a person could be offended by so many other things in the world rather than a book.     In conclusion, the books, magazines, and movies of the library should not be taken off the shelves away from the public just because they are not appropriate for some children.  Eighteen year olds are adults who should be able to chose whatever they want.  Plus if parents are worried about their child reading inappropriate books, then they can monitor that themselves.  Also, people are offended every day by other people, so books, magazines, and movies are not the only things in the world that could be offensive.  If the person thinks a movie or book is offensive to them, then do not check it out!  Not everything in our lives has to be controlled by someone, so people should lighten up and give some freedom of choice.",4,4,4,2
4149,2,"I don't believe that certain material should be taken out of our libraries. If they take the books that people get a learning expresion off of then what does that leave us with. Everybody in life should have there own chocies, we shouldn't limit them.It's all about making chocies in life, people should get the right to read the books,magaizes, ect they want, With out people looking down on them or thinking the material they receve is unatural. What one person @MONTH1 think is not good read the next person might think the total oppoiste.     Music is a creative aspest in our world, @CAPS1 person you meet are not the same so @CAPS3 should music be. You can't have the same ideas when it's comes to making your creative looks on the music in your community it's not going to turn out the same as everyones elses will. If that was the case then the world would be one boreding place to live in. I think that @CAPS1 one has there on taste in music. If your the right age and your not hurting anybody, Then whats the big problem listing to the music that incourge you to become creative.      There are alot of movies that some parents might think that they are not good for there kids to watch. I think that we shouldn't be so worried about what our kids are watching and more what there doing. I think that @CAPS1 movie you watch has a sercet point in it, In other words the lesson learned in the story. Some solutions that happen in real life might be on a movie that's probably rated @CAPS2. I don't believe that we should be focus on the rating of the movie, We shold be focus on the lesson the movie is teaching you.               The children in the world are going to have to make there own chocies and what they find intresing, @CAPS3 should we band everything we thinks thats not. We need you let the children grow on there own and aslo learn on there own. Can't make somebody listen, read or watch what he want them to.     In conclusion we need to let not just kids but everyone have the chocie there want.The world is changing everyday so we need to change our ideas with it",3,4,3,1
4153,2,"I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people like different stuff. Someone might have wanted to get that book. I don't think it would be right to take it away.      When I was in sixth grade, I was in a foster home that I hated. They would not let me listen to the music I liked. They thought it was bad for kids to listen to. All they wanted me to listen to was christian music and I did not like that.      My old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the 'devil' in me. They would make me read the bible everynight. They tried to shove religion down my throat. I think maybe that is one reason I am not religious. They would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girls husband having an affair on her.      Everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch. When parents are that strict, it usually makes the kids want to do whatever they tell them not to do. If you don't let someone watch, listen to, or read what they want, then it might not be very easy for them to express themselves. They would not be able to show off what they really like. They would be doing something that they don't even like and That is not right. Everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like.",3,3,3,1
4156,2,"I think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries. They show symbolic meaning to the ever changing world as we know it. People have different beliefs about anything, I don't care what you say everybody still has a different opinion about anything and everything. So just keep believing what you want to believe that's fine, but don't ruin it for others, you ever heard the saying, '' if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all'', well they should remember that saying and stick to it.In my years of being in school nobody has protested about certain reading materials in public libraries because everyone read what they liked because the library supplied people with the material they wanted to read. Let's say a person wanted to read a book about the fall of the wall of @LOCATION1, the library says they do not and will not carry such reading history, the person will be angry even though they can find the book somewhere else but they should still be able to find that book in that library. That is history in this world and they should know it. That compares with people wanting to destroy history made in this world, history people risk there lives for to be recognized in this world, this compares with the topic fully. I hope that this essay will give the protesters a second thought on the topic they are bickering about. That will be all",3,3,3,1
4157,2,"I believe that libraries should not censor their literature, all of our media is a fountain of knowledge waiting to be discovered. No one should be able to decide what is appropriate for the public to know. The right to decide what is and is not appropriate for us should not be decided by libraries. That right should remain with every single person, so they can decide whats right for them.          Over the last thousands and thousands of years media has grown at an incredible rate through books, music, movies, and magazines. With all of this media we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures. Media is something that always is around and reminds us of our past mistakes, to ensure that they don't happen again. The great thing about all of the media we have today is that we haven't even learned everything that we can and will from it.     Some of our media @MONTH1 not be the most appropriate things ever, but we can still learn so much from it. It @MONTH1 make some people upset and if it does then they should stay away from it. It is not right to get rid of certain parts of media because what one person @MONTH1 find immoral and wrong someone else @MONTH1 be able to learn from it some how. If you are offended by some of the material thing you should avoid it, not get rid of it for everyone.           Our media is very powerful and should not be censored. Media has an unbelieveable impact on the world, so we should not try to hide some of it. We have not even seen half of what media can do",4,3,4,2
4158,2,"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, it should not be removed. Katherine says, ' I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor.' @CAPS1 of all, she can have the right to do that but there is people who have a say in this. There are people who can read, listen, watch, and see what they like. Definately, I really think that it should not be removed even though it doesn't have positive things.     Although, it might offend some people they have a choice whether they should see, watch, listen, and read it. Many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this. Though, many people might go against it. One reason why I think that people should be allowed to see, watch, listen, and read whatever they would like to see, it's because it's their own choice. We make our own decisions whether people like it or not. Another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows. Some people do not like to be bored of the same thing.     Katherine Paterson the Author, is right in some ways. She wouldn't want her children to see things that are inappropriate. I have a daughter and I wouldn't want her to see things that are abhor. Last reason would be children should not allowed to see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older. These things can influence children very intensely.     Indeed, many people in this world are influenced with bad things. The author stated, 'then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Right, she is meaning that we have a choice of what our children would like to see. For example, there is a magazines full of negative words and full of horrid stuff. Would you pull it out of the shelf for your child to not have a chance to see that? You should if you love your child even though it's your own choice. You would want the best for you child to not see, read, watch, and listen to things that are inappropriate.     In conclusion, this would be your choice. There will always be things in the world that you don't like. You cannot stop the terrible things from happening. In the libraries there shouldn't be anything negative anyway because you never know what your child might be doing. Simply, teach your kid what is wrong and right. Finally, from what you experienced. Teach them the right things from the wrong things you learned so they wouldn't do the same mistake as you did.",4,4,4,2
4159,2,"I believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people. A library should never be intended for a certain group of readers. As far as I'm concerned, books are creativity in text-form. Creativity is a large part of life, and without it, we would all be the same. There is at least one book for every person in the world, and whether reading is a hobby or not does not matter, there is a book that will interest you.      It is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to 'offensive' content. With different personalities comes different writers. With different writers comes different books. With different books comes different readers. There are a lot of people out there who like to read. What are the people who @MONTH1 like 'offensive' content going to do when these books are taken off the shelves?      Books are written for two reasons: allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors. I think that if a writer has the ability to put whatever he/she wants in a book, that book should be available to anyone and everyone.",3,3,3,1

Having them banned from shelves shouldnt even be a question, if children shouldnt read, watch, or listen to it then its the parents responsibility to make sure they dont.     I dont think they should take those kind of books, movies, or music off the shelves because what about teens that like them or grown ups also. There just gonna take them down for the children but lose buisiness from grown ups and teens. That doesnt make any sence at all. I think either the child should know what he or she can read, watch, or listen too, and if they cant then its up to the parent or a grown up around them to let them know what they can choose.     A way to solve the problem can be seperate those offensive books, music, or movies from ones that are appropriate for children. That would make everything alot easier so nothing comes off the shelves and knowone loses buissiness.",3,3,3,1
4165,2,"It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. If @CAPS1 is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. There is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. @CAPS1 must learn in order to teach. @CAPS1 must teach for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden.Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect.      If @CAPS1 were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. It is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. It seems that the time of research is diminishing. @CAPS1 can only learn so much from a world history textbook. It @MONTH1 not be completely accurate. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. With such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help @CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The hidden information could be helpful. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. They are gone. At any moment, anyone and everyone could die. Time is mainly all we have. We need knowledge to make the most out of it.     Everyone deserves to be heard. If @CAPS1 were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material @MONTH1 be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all @CAPS1 can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard.     Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it.",5,5,5,3
4169,2,"Teachers in schools do their best to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their certain age group. Parents also make the effort to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to as a way of keeping them innocent. At a point in a young adults life, this feeling of censorship wears off, and the teenager decides to read, watch, and listen to whatever they want to. This is how it goes in most cases, but is this strong feeling of public censorship too old fashioned for todays society? In my opinion, yes. Censorship, to a certain extent, should not be in present in libraries.      There will always be something that one person finds in appropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine. When I was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program I attended. One movie, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 specifically, created conflict. While my mother was fine with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate. Because of this one parent family all the kids in the program had to watch a differnt movie that everyone's parents were okay with. As @PERSON1 said eventually 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive, there would be nothing left; people can find offensive material in almost any material in this century. It is the way our culture is. I am not saying it is right, but someone else might think so and that person has a right to go to a library and get a book that they find perfectly fine.      In the @ORGANIZATION1 censorship has almost never been present. It is part of what is great about this country. People can speak, believe, and read what they want without the government interfering. This is not true in a lot of places and we should value that as @CAPS3, not complain about it. The government has no right constitutionally to censor material put in public, there can be age restrictions, but to completely cut the material out would go against this countrie's policy of freedom. I agree that age restrictions are okay, but I believe it is untimately up to the parents of a child what they want their child to watch or read.      Overall, the censorship issue is a little bit of a grey area. In my opinion our country is about freedom and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution. People can believe what they want, but the issue will be hard to conclude. Everyone has a different view on something, that is what started this issue in the first place. When everyone learns to get along, maybe then can this problem be solved",4,4,4,2
4172,2,"The idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been debated. Libraries are places that people can go to stray away from the norm and get lost in the works of other authors and musicians. I believe that reading and the ability to express oneself through the powers of music is a very essential part of our lives. Censoring these would only shelter our lives and keep younger generations from discovering the effect that words have on our emotions and actions from day to day.      Books are one of the oldest forms of information we've had throughout the years. I think that if someone were to remove a piece of information that they found offensive it would only open the door to other people to find excuses to keep the hard work of authors behind closed doors.     Personally i enjoy reading. I think that with every book i read it opens the door to other beliefs and culturs that i would otherwise never learn about. Children need to be able to explore the world, to get to know how other civilizations grow and function as to how we in the @LOCATION1 function in our own little world that is getting more and more judgemental every day. The only way to do this is to pick up a book from someone who has been lucky enough to experience it themselves.     I have always had a deep passion for music. When i want to relax music helps me to center myself and open my mind. In my opinion, censoring music shouldn't be something that people even consider. Removing music from libraries is difficult for me to even begin to try and accept.      Freedom of speech was once a huge part of our country. Now it seems as if everything we've been taught of our great @LOCATION2 has been nothing more than just a false cover to let the government control how we live, act, and now how we choose to express ourselves. Music is a freeing way to express oneself in a not so violent way. During the sixties and seventies, music was the way alot of people protested things like war and racism without being violent. Times have changed though and the people in charge of our country no longer see it as an 'appropriate' option.      I belive that just because one society believes something to be inappropriate, doesn't mean that it actually is that way. We worry enough already about what other people think, why try to judge others' work if we can't accept the fact that we are all different. If we all accepted the differences in our world's cultures, there wouldn't have to be a debate on whether or not to censor an expressive and emotional piece of art that deserves to be shown in our libraries",4,4,4,2
4176,2,"Good? Bad? Offensive or not? These are just a few of the questions asked when referring to content in any given book, magazine, or even a song. Who are we to judge what's good, what's offensive, or even what is appropriate for any being?     From things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. the author(s) @MONTH1 express what they feel on a given topic. Though their opinion might not please others, there's nothing that can be done about it. In society people are going to talk, to write, to sing, to listen. Whether everyone agrees with that is a different story.      In society, no matter what the topic is, there will always be at least one person that has a problem with it. The world will never be perfect! The only thing that can be done to assuage the chaos is for people to self censor what they @MONTH1 ingest from reading or listening to these different books and lyrics. If one shows so much emnity towards a given topic, then they are able to do as they please, and choose not to listen/read.      At the bottom of numerous cd's, both explicit and non, there is a label, an advisory that warns a person. It will briefly tell you that there is some content they @MONTH1 not be appropriate, that @MONTH1 hurt feelings, and simply offend. It is then that one can choose to listen to the cd or not.      Every human is entitled to freedom of speech. This doesn't necessarily mean that everything said by a being is okay; but everyone is entitled to his own opinion. There are words spoken that will offend many! From @PERSON1 using racial slurs in speeches, to @LOCATION1 calling females derrogatory words, all the way back to a white male calling his colored friend a nigger.      People will always be offended. There are many different ways of looking at life, and many different opinions. Not everyone agrees with one another, because everyone is unique in his own way. From ethnicity to personalites, from talented athletes to intelligent students, and even from ancestors to religion. Everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are. We are all special; and we all think differently. We find certain slurs and lyrics offensive, while others @MONTH1 not.      @NUM1 years ago when i was in @NUM2 grade, my @CAPS1 class was reading a story about the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. There were @CAPS4 young black children striving to get a respected education in a white school. Times were tough then, and there was still alot of racism in @LOCATION2. As my teacher read us this book everyday, we all sat and listened taciturnly. After the third day of reading this book, we all sat down like usual ready to finish the book. Five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book, she read and enunciated every word in the book. In the middle of the sentence, it read 'nigger-lover', and the teacher didn't hesitate a bit as she said it. In less than @MONEY1, @NUM3 blacks children walked out of the room yelling curse words at the top of their lungs. This teacher didn't realize that she had offended these children by what she took as simply reading to her class.      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' wasn't censored in any way. Though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh, no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school. Because the teacher was white, and the children didn't want her to say that word, everyone attacked her vocally.      I've began to realize that everyone cannot be pleased. There will always be at least @NUM4 person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike. In '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', the book wasn't censored, but I still believe that it should stay on library shelves. That book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past. By keeping the harsh language, I feel as if people realize how much harder times were.      Books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain a statement that someone doesn't agree with, and by removing that I feel like one can not fully understand the message the author is trying to get across. For all of these reasons, I proudly say that I believe that these different books, movies, lyrics, and magazines should be kept on the shelves",5,5,5,3
4180,2,"I believe that many books in our local libraries @MONTH1 come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There @MONTH1 be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries.              Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them. Some young adult books @MONTH1 be venturing too far, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. I don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. Many parents have different rules for their children then others, and they @MONTH1 not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. I remember times when I was a little my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted, because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place          As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. You know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading.     The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong. Some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically. Their parents @MONTH1 be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching.     I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. I also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is aloud viewing. Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section",4,4,4,2
4183,2,"Should offensive material be censored?     Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world. Protecting your children from things that offend you, @MONTH1 stop them from growing up badly. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there.     Censoring or removing things that you find offensive @MONTH1 be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone @MONTH1 want to do this. A parent @MONTH1 not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. Another reason parents @MONTH1 want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. Some parents @MONTH1 feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. They also @MONTH1 feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly.     Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Parents @MONTH1 think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that @MONTH1 be considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, ect., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years.     I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people @MONTH1 like reading graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. I think people should be able to have a choice.     Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, @NUM1's, and burned onto @CAPS1, there's no removing it. Books that some @MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person @MONTH1 lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. Lots of people own these kinds of movies. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?",4,4,4,2
4185,2,"We live in a world @DATE1 inundated and persuaded by media.  Ever since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions of others from history and from the present.  Whether we are reading a book, watching a motion picture, or even listening to a new music artist, our lives are being affected by such media.     The art world is considered to be one of the most controversal businesses to work in.  Each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics.  We all are given the right to our opinion on such  pieces.  Every piece of art is judged and then criticized.  However, many find certain pieces to be offending in some way, shape, or form.  It is quite impossible to produce such a piece that will fit everybody's satisfaction.  For an example, religious pieces are often scorned for their nonfactual information or for the director's or author's opinion over the matter.  Since we live in such a diverse community of religions, these pieces will never satisfy the audience.  Movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience.  Why not learn from them and reflect?     No piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world.  As a personal example, I can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized.  The men and women who fought for our country @MONTH1 enjoy to see such pieces written about them, but war protesters and peace keepers @MONTH1 see this as an insult to their cause.       @PERSON1 wrote a book by the name @CAPS1 @NUM1.  This book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship.  The world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of peoples opinions.  If a book or movie was offensive to a group of people, then they burned the books.  History books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending.  Non-religious groups thought that religion was offensive, so they burned the @CAPS2 and other works of religion.  Their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent.      @PERSON1 denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson.  For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity.  Every mind is special and different and will never share identical thoughts as his neighbor.  Therefore, we must recognize that we have to survive and live together.  We can not escape the diversity in which we live in.  The books we see on shelves, the movies we see on the big screen, and music we listen through our earphones all make up our generations history and the next.  We need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal.  If we throw away our history and our accomplishments, man is left nothing to improve on, nothing to leave his or her marking on history.  We have to accept others ideas and build on them to improve our life and other's.  As we stand @DATE1 in a world filled with diversity, we must move on and reflect.  It is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on",4,4,4,2
4186,2,"I am writing you today to propose an explanation on my views of censorship in libraries. I recently had visited a library and some of the things I read in my time being there was really overwhelming.I think it should be censored and taking off the shelf. If you are a place of business you should not want things like that on your shelf. You should not want costumers reading it and feeling disgusted. I hope something I write will propose my reasons.              I have plenty of reasons to censor things and have them taking off the shelves that are offensive to me and others who visit the library, but only speaking on my behalf there were certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., that was offensive. I believe things in the nature should be handled in great authority. If anything I am trying to help me and my fellow citizens.              Just think if a visitor come in and pick up a magazine and it has insulting visual details of something that the reader can relate to or have experienced, and it is getting talked down about instead of beeing looked at, then they would be very offened. For them to come there it had to be a reson that they came, I know it wasn't so they would feel insulted. It is very inappropiate to have things that are offensive in the library.                It is plenty of different reason people come to libraries. Some come to get away, and to others its a daily routine. Whatever the case maybe they should feel comfortable in the place they are at. Why would you want people in the community or people period to not be comfortable where they are at. Just think if they are uncomfortable, then they are going to tell others and you will loose alot of fellow friends and alot of business. Think strongly on the things you do and the way you approach things to get peoples attention.                          To answer the question @CAPS1, I agree strongly on getting the offensive materials moved from the shelves. I believe in making people happy and one thing that is wrong with society today is too much judging and talking down and talking bad about people. If people would not judge or insult people then the world would be alot safer. It has to start somewhere, every little start causes for a great ending. I think this would be a good start on making the world happier and bringing all of us closer together. I hope something I wrote will help you on your descision",3,2,3,1
4190,2,"@CAPS1 us? @CAPS1 now? Those questions just might be flashing through your head right now.  The reason @CAPS1 I am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today.  In this context hopefully I will be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions of '@CAPS1 us?', and '@CAPS1 now?'.     Censorship, what does that mean to you?  To me that means censoring many things in the world to protect it from children who are under the age, not people who are old enough to handle inapropiate things.  In todays libraries there are many uncensored things, that happen to be in the adult section of the libraries.  Things such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong.  Now you are probably wondering, @CAPS1 us.     In today's world many people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored materials. @CAPS1 us?  In the world today there are so many laws, regulations, and even authorities protecting our rights. Now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights.  Many want to protect their youth from some of the so called 'harmful' things in society.  Today you can try to create a law or bill that @MONTH1 make it through the government, now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material.         @CAPS1 now?  Throught the years the world has changed, everything has become easier to have access to.  Now one thing they think they @MONTH1 be able to do is remove the adult section of the libraries if enough people stand to fight for it, it will not happen.  There is an adult section for adults not children, people need to realize that.       In the end, the adult section needs to stay in our libraries. Some of the material in the section is not always bad, sometimes it contains material over war, and recessions.  When people are of age they are allowed to enter the areas, not any younger.  Don't punish the rest of the world for one libraries mistake of letting children have access to adult material, make the children realize it wasn't their area to be in.  Then many parents @MONTH1 see it's not just some of the world, that the whole world is exactly the same way. The books, music, magazines, and etc., need to stay where they are",4,4,4,2
4191,2,I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.  But this is what I think is right,2,2,2,0
4194,2,"Censorship in libraries is a topic that is argued back and forth in todays society. It is something that we all should think about and voice our opinions about. I believe that items in a library should not be censored based on constitutional @CAPS5, the creation of gray areas, and the depletion of classic literature.     The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1, clearly @LOCATION1 the idea of freedom of the press. Not only does this give publishers the right to print whatever they please, but it also gives people a right to choose for themselves what they can and want to read. Censoring books in a library would be denying this right that is clearly spelled out in the @CAPS4 of @CAPS5. I refuse to support any idea that directly opposes the @CAPS3 and the people of the @LOCATION1 should be appalled that this sort of thing is even in discussion.      When it comes to censoring something based on how offensive something is, one always has to consider the gray areas that will be formed. For instance, what is offensive in one book @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else who would benefit from reading it. The term 'offensive' is a reletive one, in that the definition varies from person to person. No one thing can be deemed offensive by one hundred percent of the population and therefore no one thing can be removed without opposition. This creates areas of gray where there is no right answer. This would be extremely problamatic for those trying to censor items within  a library. Secondly, the decision on who would get to decide what is and is not offensive would cause as much contreversy as the books themselves. Knowing that every person carries a different opinion the people deciding would have to equally represent every persons' opinion when making a decision, talk about problamatic.      Finally, censoring books would eliminate classic literature and would deplete an understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers. For example, in @PERSON1's '@CAPS7 @PERSON2' the 'n' word appears over one hundred times. Many @CAPS8 @CAPS9 take great offense at the use of this word. However, this book is seen as one of the centuries greatest works and cannot be removed from the education of young people because of an offensive term. If people want to censor books, then censor them from their own children and not the children of others and inevitably an entire population.     In conclusion, the censorship of literature and other items in a library is not only impossible, but utterly unconstituional. The idea of censoring items from children based on offense is not something that should be pursued",4,4,4,2
4196,2,"Living in todays society there are many diffrent people and many diffrent outlooks on things, the world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions. There are an uncountable number of diffrent ways people look at the world and ways that people percieve things. To tell someone what they should and should not know is simple minded in the aspect that anyone can percieve a book, music, movie, or magazine diffrently.     @CAPS3 quote by Katherine Paterson,in short, metophorically uses a book and a shelf to let the reader comprehend the importance of information that is passed down from generation to generation. The book represents the information in the world and the shelf stands for the the place the imformation is stored for one to go seek information.     To remove the book off the shelf indefinatly is to close the mind of a future generation. It was once said ' you can not know your present without knowing your future.' @CAPS1 the book @MONTH1 offend one reader it could also inspire another as well. Everyone has a diffrent opinion and life style. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people are granted with better lifestyles than others, @CAPS2 are unfortunatly living everyday in struggle.      One book that @MONTH1 offend a person who thinks the book is harsh and should be taken off the shelf, could also inspire a young child going through struggle's to overcome there surroundings and be a better person.      I have read many books that did not interest me and passed them on to my sibligs and friends. Shockingly the book interested them. After interviewing my siblings and friend over the book it turns out that they got a diffrent message from the book than I. No one thinks the same thoughts a hundred percent of the time.      '@CAPS2 @MONTH1 argue that the glass is half empty while others argue it is half full.' @CAPS3 quote is a perfect example of the minds of the world today. Ultimatly if everyone thought the same then everyone would be the same person. To 'leave no books left on the shelf for any of us' is like programing a robot to only do what you say.      In such a diverse community it is impossible to remove any book off the shelf. Living in todays society there many diffrent people and many diffrent outlooks on things, the world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions",3,4,3,1
4198,2,"Libraries across the world are facing the obstacle of censorship. Censorship has become a bigger deal in this day and age. @CAPS4 can effect books, music, movies, magazines, and many more. This posts the question is censorship a good thing or is @CAPS4 bad?      Censorship allows certain books to be removed from the shelves of a library if a certain person finds the book to be offensive. Everyone has there own opinion about things so why should that effect what we are allowed to learn? What one person finds offensive could be perfectly fine with everyone else. Plus you are not being forced to @CAPS3 something you @CAPS1'@CAPS2 want to. If you find @CAPS4 ofensive then one solution is very easy, @CAPS1'@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!     Censorship not only effects the learner, @CAPS4 effects the writer. Censorship takes away the one thing a writer has, there freedom of speech. Writers create books, music, and magazine articles to voice there thoughts on topics, to show others how they see the world, and to show what might happened to them in their life. Because writers do this, @CAPS4 makes a connection with the reader that they can understand and relate too. Writers have a choice what they want to convey to the world and they should be given the privalge to do so.      Even if you are able to put a censorship on books and music at a library, you can'@CAPS2 censor the internet. The internet has become a place where anyone around the world can find websites that they like, where there are books, music, magazines, and even shopping stores. A library is a public library just like the internet is public too. Anyone should be able to acess @CAPS4 and enjoy what they like.      Putting censorship on things is almost equivilent to not letting a teacher teach because of there nationality or not letting our president give a speech because he is @CAPS5. Censorship is based on a opinion someone has. @CAPS4 shouldn'@CAPS2 effect the learners or the writers. Censorship holds back the voice of society and the thoughts of everyday people. Censorship should not even exist",4,4,4,2
4200,2,"I dont think that they should remove music, movies, magazinwa, etc., Should be tooken away because if you take all of that away then there really wouldnt be anything to do in your spaire time but be bored. I know alot of people couldn't handle being bored. I know I couldnt handle it if all I was bored all the time because someone took away music. Now it would be a different story if we never had music, movies, and all that other good stuff. None would really care becaused they new what it was or hurd about it. How would you feel if you had to drive for @NUM1 hours and didn't have any music or magazines to read? I'm thinking you would be really bored im guessing.",2,1,2,0
4202,2,"Censorship has been the topic of many debates involving politicians, @CAPS2 activists, and the everyday citizen. There are groups that believe the government has every right to censor anything that is considered offensive in today's society. Some individuals could argue with this belief by supporting the statement that it is not the government's position to decide what is considered offensive and what is not. I just so happen to agree.      One opinion, mainly supported by people with children, is that books, music, and movies ect. should be censored to protect the younger generations. While it is true that parents should be concerned with what their children are exposed to, if the offensive material that is involved in the everyday life of an adult is completely restricted from an individual as a child how is he or she expected to be prepared and excel in the future? Why do we go to school for atleast twelve years of our lives? We go to prepare ourselves for the challenges of being an adult. We place ourselves in an environment that is specifically created to make us comfortable with the responsibilities of maturity. If not properly exposed to something, there is absolutely no way to be prepared to encounter it in the future.      However, not all individuals support censorship because of their children. There are adults that would like to see no more of today's offensive material for their selves than they would want their children to see. My rebuddle to this is that if you do not want to see it then do not choose to see it. No individual is ever forced to be exposed to anything in todays media. Turn off the television if the program bothers you. Do not read the book or magazine. Change the radio station. Every person is capable of controlling what they hear and see, and it is unnessecary to attempt to remove from society what could simply be ignored.      Lastly, one of the most consistent debates around censorship is that the government should control what is included in today's media. Think back in @LOCATION1's history; when has giving the government more power in our everyday lives ever been good for our society? The reason our forefathers founded our great country was to have the freedom they were isolated from in @LOCATION2. The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 was created to insure that the government could not attempt to control what they had no right to control. The freedom of speech is not just referring to what comes from an individual's mouth, but what goes into their eyes and ears as well. The citizens of this great country are more than capable of deciding for theirselves what is offensive to them and what is not.     It is the government's duty to protect our country from other countries and groups of people who attempt to break it apart, but not to control what we see and hear. Meeting and debates are held everyday to enhance the quality of our freedom and occasionally to gain more freedom. I ask why some individuals would want to give one freedom we do have away? The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the greatest countries ever to exist, yet we are too lazy to decide what we are exposed to in our everyday lives? It is time for our society to stop being nurtured by the government and start doing our own dirty laundry",5,4,5,3
4205,2,"Do you like what I like? Maybe and maybe not. What is or not offensive to you compared to other varies on both ends. Why? Everyone has their point of view. You @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree and we have others who do not care. There are many which includes: religious beliefs, having independence, and experimenting.     Religious beliefs are important would you not agree? Certain material in this world maybe offensive to their own kind. Such as gay rights. This @MONTH1 apply to everyone else that they are not accepting it. For the ones who do accept it, you can tell they are open minded. Unlike the rebels going against it that is their own state of mind. I believe it is important you go along with your religious beliefs.     Independence is what we are or what we assume to have or already have. Whether the music, movies, magazines, etc are offensive to others this has no effects to you. Why? It is because you know what is right and wrong. So what if all the non sense things @MONTH1 have caught your attention. Should you take control and get rid of it? No. It does not bother you. You take it as it is, being independent.     Experimenting is self contained. As simple as it is you do it or do not. It is more than likey that people are/were under the influence. I, myself, have been in that siutation before. I'm known to be the crazy child in the family. My dad would always lecture me about being careful with who I hang with when I'm out. As a teenager I let those words pass by me. I was always the youngest out of the people I hung out with. Was I ever under the influence? Yes. Did I ever get hurt? No. I can and will say I experimented with life.     Does it hurt to observe or experiment with the bad? It usually varies. Religious beliefs, it @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be disrespectful. To have independence, you are the one in control. Experimenting, that is a choice on your own. What is offensive to me @MONTH1 not be to you. I have my own state of mind and so do you.",3,3,3,1

People have a right to their oppinion, but i do not think any one has the right to take books away from a @CAPS1 library.      @CAPS1 library, the facts are in the name. It @CAPS5 a @CAPS1 library, where people can go and find a book to pass time, a book to use on an @CAPS2 assignment, or a book to read to their child. Taking a book off the shelves just because it offendid someone does not makes sense to me. A person can pick up a book, be offended and complian about it, that @CAPS5 freedom of speech. I do not see fault in that. But when a person picks up a book, @CAPS5 offendid,and demand that the book per se @CAPS5 taken off the shelves of a @CAPS1 library. That @CAPS5 when i have issues seeing where they think they have the right.     Katherine Paterson said in her text that 'If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then you aslo have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelve for any of us.' @CAPS3't that a scary thought? If a person was offended by a book they could take it off the shelve at his or her own will? I fear the out come of that. I am sure that a person could figure out something offensive about any book.      Taking books off the shelve @CAPS5 taking knowledge away from the people. We as @CAPS4 have the right to read at our pleasure, any book that we have the slighest whim to read, and be able to read that book with out prosecution from a people that find the book in question 'offensive.'     The day we let people take books off the shelves because they offend them, @CAPS5 the day our first admendment fails. As a nation we need to stand stron againts banning books from @CAPS1 libraries.

4214,2,"People of all ages have the right to read any material that they want @CAPS1 or other family members @MONTH1 tell their children not to read about a certain topic. Those children will either listen to their @CAPS1 or not. If these children do not listen, we need to do something about it. We need to have rules in libraries. Children do not need bad influences in thier lives.Adults have the right to keep children away from this information.     Leaders of a library have many different sections in their library. Children and adults both have thier own sections as well as teens. These groups of people have a right to choose what material it is that they want to read, watch, or listen to. I believe that if we make the sections have an age limit we can prevent children from finding bad information. Right now, children can read this information at any time. Adults can eliminate it.     Children in libraries should be supervized. Too many books are about drugs, sex, or pregnancy. Reading this material @MONTH1 give off bad information to a child. Children are not old enough to be learning about sex. @CAPS1 should be the first to tell thier child about sex. Young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful. Children learn about drugs in movies, books, and can hear about them in music. Many books deal with pregnacy as well. Learning about pregnancy make them think how that women got pregnant with a child. Those children then start to ask other adults and children.      Children can also read or listen about gun violence. Children read about gangs and think that it is cool. They then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang. This information is very harmful and should not be allowed to children. After some children read about it they get thier friends involved. This information can spread across the school. Violence is very harmful for children.     Librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read. If that library has offensive material it is their job not to let that material get into a young persons hands. They should be able to have strict limits on age apropriate material. If a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit, they should not be allowed to have the book. The sections that they @MONTH1 find harmful information should be closed to young children. Children in libraries should be supervized. Books about drugs, sex, or pregnacy @MONTH1 not be allowed for children to read. Violence in books seem to spread across schools. Adults can help prevent harmful information from all children.",4,4,4,2
4218,2,"Materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelve. People might need those materials for research or if they just want to find out about something. If the material is offensive to someone they can report it but the people that work at the library might not do anything about it. The people that find something offensive could also ignore it and walk away.     If I found something that was offensive to me I would just ignore it. I might look at it to see what it says but I would not say anything about it. There are some people that would have to look at that for research or something else. So why get it removed from the shelve? I have not seen anything that would be offensive to me yet but, if I did then I would not say anything. Now some people would say something but, what if you walked in a library looking for a book for your research paper, and it was not there because someone found it offensive? What would you do? Yes you could get on the internet but, it might not have what you are looking for exactly.     I have had a lot of research papers. There was one time when I went to the library and could not find a book or a magazine to help me with my research. I had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look information up. When I did get on the computer I only had an hour to look up everything. I did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late. Computers are good for looking up stuff, but when you have a book in mind that would give you a lot of information, you go for the book not the computer.     I know there are materials that are offensive to people. I know people get mad at them but, it is not the librarys fault. They most likely have to have those materials on the shelve because that is whats required of them. So if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it.",4,4,4,2
4219,2,"To @CAPS1 it @DATE2 concern,     @CAPS2 in life has to deal with something offensive towards them at least once. It @DATE2 be swear words in a popular song, or even people's behavior and actions on a regular basis. Be that as it @DATE2, nobody was made perfectly, and we all have to learn to cope with people's flaws. The library is for everyone; not just you specifically. Just like people's personalities we have to deal with different things that fit those specific personalities. @PERSON1's quote said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right...' @CAPS3 is a strong and truthful accusation, and I believe that things in a library should should have some censorship, but up to a specific point.     We all realize that the biggest population of people in a library-- and perhaps the most innocent-- are children. Each parent has different values and standards for their child. What @DATE2 be offensive to one parent @DATE2 not be to another. If one mother thinks a book that talks about something she believes to be inappropriate to her children should be removed, another mother @DATE2 not. The first mother's opinion is different than everyone else; she could say she wanted @CAPS3 book removed from the library, but then so could the second mother about a different book. If everyone voiced their opinion on what books they didn't think were appropriate for their children, then we would 'have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' according to Katherine Paterson. I believe she is right. Besides, who is to say what is right for everyone?     Not one person has the same morals or values as another. For one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual. I have dealt with situations like @CAPS3 before; everyone has. People tell me what they believe to be right, and I do not agree with them. It is simply a matter of everyday life; people's opinions and morals are going to clash. Eveyone is different, and if one person doesn't like a certain magazine in the library, another person @DATE2 not like a different one. If we were to all voice our own opinion on what we want censored and what we don't, nothing would be left. The library shelves would be completely empty. Even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go, I do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point.     Taking into account everyone's diversification in @CAPS3 world, I do believe that there should be censorship up to a certain point. If something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against, I believe that the book, or books should be removed. I am not saying that because a couple of people weren't for a certain artist from the @DATE1 that it should be taken away at once. If it is a major issue that highly offends many people, it should not be in a public library. Libraries are for obtaining information, and for reading; not for brewing up offensive opinions on certain topics. There should be a certain limit on what is in a library, because there are things out there people really shouldn't be seeing or hearing. But it shouldn't get to the point where people can just remove books from the shelf at their own free will. Without some limit on censorship in a library, absolutely anything could be found there.     When we think of a library we don't think of things that are offensive. People view the library as a positive place, created for people's own personal enjoyment. That doesn't mean that we will never find something that @DATE2 offend us in some way there, but people should not be able to just remove books from the shelf because they don't agree with their morals. @CAPS2 is different, and nobody has the right to tell them what exactly is right or wrong, up to a certain point. I know from experience that it can be a tough thing to ignore sometimes, but we all seem to do it everday with the people around us; we can't just choose to get rid of them. @CAPS2 wants to be comfortable, but sometimes we just have to deal with things in life like a book we don't deem appropriate. So I believe that in a way, an excessive amount censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing. If we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library, there would be nothing left. Afterall, I wouldn't mind walking into a library with shelves full of magazines and books, instead of one completely empty.     Thank you.",5,5,5,3
4221,2,I think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a   room just for grown ups. In the dunkirk library there is a room that has just adult books and the kids cannot go in there with out a parent. So whenever you go in there your parent are with you. But i dont think you can check them out. But if i had a kid i would not want them to see that kind of stuff until they got older so i think there should be seperate rooms. So whenever they got older and maturd they could go in there and see the books and maybe one day check them out and read one of them.      But on the other hand why not leave them on the shelf for kids to see because if not there gonna see iot other places or from other people then they go home asking there mom what this means and stuff why not let them learn on ther own from a book. There are some people that woulf agree with that but then there are people that would disagree with that. So maybe there should be rooms for different books and you can go in them whenever you want or maybe there should be rules that you cant go in there with out a parent.          I don't no what to do maybe there should be a vote between people if they like it or not. But some people would be mad over that so if you chose one someone would not like it or aomething like that.My upion is to just keep the books there and let the kids find out on there own.Some people would think im a bad parent but would you want you child to find out somwhere else.,2,2,2,0
4224,2,"People go to the library to find certain types of material. Some people get offended by some of the material and feel that it should be removed. Certain materials should not be removed if found offensive to others because it might not be offensive to someone else that might enjoy it. The offensive material can be history that the world need to know, such as racism. If they did not know the importance of slavery they wouldn't know of the past life and why we are treated the way we are being treated. History is a big part of life that everyone one should know. That's why we have history class to let us know of the history that we've been through.     All material don't have to be history that is offensive. Some material have sex and violence that is offensive. The libraries should have labels on every section to let people know what type of material it is. If people know what type of material it is and still choose to view it then they get what they ask for. It shouldn't be removed because they didn't like it. I learned in history class about wars that had violence in them that some of my classmates didn't like but that's what happened and we needed to know.     Materials are made for a reason. They should not be removed if found offensive to someone but not offensive to another. I read books in school with all kinds of violence and other things people @MONTH1 not like but it's history. History makes a difference in our lives and it's what we need. You can not removed that. If you find it offensive just don't view that material again.",3,3,3,1
4226,2,"Movies is to popcorn as music is to headphones. Right? It is all fun and games until someone's innocence is completely destroyed. The simplest forms of entertainment are being minipulated by today's world. Many of the children in our modern society are quickly becoming conditioned and used to seeing and reacting to media found in the everyday store, shop, or library. The innocence of the youth today is slowly being destroyed by the subliminal messages found in music, magazines, and movies. The messages are all the same in each type of media: sex, drugs, and violence.      The world of music has evolved so much over the past decades of time. We go from jazz, disco, funk, rock, hard rock, to hip- hop/rap. All of these types belonging to a certain decade. But in our era, the music industry is exploding with rap and hip- hop music. This type of music is triggered towards the three ideas of sex, drugs, and violence. Almost every song that is heard today on the radio or on your iPod will most likely have something to do with one of those three. The sense of being so naive and so innocent is broken after listening to these songs everytime the radio is on. The youth does not need to be listening to this whatsoever and therefore, parents should be more aware about what their children are listening to and should think more about the effects that the media has on them.     Recently, more and more people are turning to articles and segments of works to read instead of the 'good old fashioned' novels. The novels that were written before our era are clean and nonexplicit. But today, literature has gone down a new course. More and more, @ORGANIZATION1 companies are becoming less tradional and more upfront about topics that are sexual, violent, or drug related. For example, in @ORGANIZATION1, you will see articles strictly pretaining to sex-like actions. Possibly on the other side of the page, you will see an ad for @CAPS1 cigarettes. Soon enough, kids are going to think that everything they are seeing and looking at will be okay and soon act upon it. The libraries that are offering these magazines for rental should restrict children from reading them due to the lack of modesty and morals found in these magazines.      There has always been a sense of subliminal messaging throughout the development and evolution in the cinematic world of movies. Movies are a timeless object of entertainment. But recently, the subtle or blunt 'hints' of sex, drugs, and violence is portayed in almost all movies offered in the box office today. There have been those action packed movies where there is all the fighting and the blood and the punching. Then there are the sappy movies where all it seems the main characters do is have emotional fights that are soon resolved by a session of steamy sexual actions. These types of movies are offered in libraries nationwide and are easily accessible to children. The youth of our country do not need to be seeing all of these actions and hearing these messages. In no way, shape, or form is this morally correct.      All in all, library censorship is very weak. The people who organize and let this kind of media float around for kids to pick up have some moral issues that need to be checked. The more times a child reads, listens, or watches media with subliminal or blunt messages about sex, drugs, and violence, the more they are going to think it is okay to act and do these actions.  All sense of innocence is destroyed and children are not children anymore",4,4,4,2
4227,2,"Why would you ever censor anything in a library? Apparently because things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect. can be found offensive.  If something is considered offensive, why put it in a library anyway if its going to be open to anyone in the public, including children?       First off, censorship is important but we don't need it in libraries of all places.  Libraries is a place where all sorts of literature comes together in one place where it can be seen and read by those who admire literature.  Censorship is stopping this by pulling books off shelfs because they are considered offensive.  If a book is offensive, first decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to.  Then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience.  If it is found to be offensive to an adult audience, then it should be pulled off the shelves of a library.  Otherwise it should be placed in the adult section of the library.     Libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature.  As mentioned before, if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult audience, it should be placed in an adult section.  Books that are suitable for children should be put in the children's section.  You can even have a such section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers.  Sections in a library almost completely defeats the need of censorship.  Sections help correctly place books and other pieces of literature in a library so that onlt readers of certain suitable ages @MONTH1 read them.     In conclusion, sections in a library can be used instead of censorship.  If we were to censor what books were on the shelves in a library the eventually there will hardly any books for anybody.  Sections help keep books in a library, but keeps them in a place where the right audience can view them",4,4,4,2
4239,2,They should be aloud to be removed because some books are offensive. Even if they are offensive they can teach young teenagers about their past. The books could be about the kkk or the @ORGANIZATION1. Some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went threw. The books could be a school assignment.           The way i see it is if your teenage child is interested in the history or the violence of the past you should allow them to read what they want. Some book such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS6 are great to read for school assignments. These @CAPS6 book's are very helpful to read because you can learn about your history and about the wars at the same time. I think if your child checks a book out from the library he or she should return it in a week.     The library should give the child a certain amount of time to return the book. If the child dose not return the book in that amount of time they should charge them for every day it is late. If the book is damaged they shud charge who ever checked that book out. The book shud be in the condition it was in when it left so other people can check it out after its returned. the library should keep certain books at the library such as the bible and collage books.      The libary should allow @CAPS6 books to each person. Instead of three or four this would keep books on the shelfs. It would also keep people from loosing books. I think people under twenty @CAPS3 should not be aloud to check out movies or music. I think they should have to show i.d. to prove there over twenty @CAPS3. there should be more rules then just being quit in the library they should make people start keeping books at the library and only allow them to take home @CAPS3 or @CAPS6 books. For instance i check out @CAPS3 book every week and return the @CAPS3 i checked out the same day i go to get a new @CAPS3. I only check out the book i really want to read and i read it and return it. The magazines should never be checked out.,3,3,3,1
4242,2,"We as @CAPS1 have the right to say what we want, and do as long as it is within the laws. If they take away some books because they are racey or because some people find them wrong, then they are saying we shouldn't learn the history of our civilization. A great man once said '@CAPS2 who do not learn from the past are condemed to repeat it.' @CAPS3 is saying that if we take away the books that are even obscured we are taking that history away from our children and they will do the same mistakes that we have done in our lifes.     Taking away the content that is obsene will make our children unknowledgable to the fact that it happened or how the past really was. '@CAPS4 @CAPS5's @CAPS6' is under critism because it uses the '@CAPS7-word' alot in the text. There is no reason to change the book because that is how the people talked, back in the day, and how things were done. If they change the book they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh, harsh thing.     When I think of censorship in the library, I think of how the @ORGANIZATION1 is trying to change the past and how it is trying to nurf the childrens history of what really happened. Censorshiop should be on tv, movies, and music so the little kids dont see the wrong things to earl, but when it comes to lititure in the library they shouldn't do it at all because only the liturate people will know what it means and what the text is actually saying. There should not be a censhorship in the lititure of the past, the present, and the future.",3,4,3,1
4244,2,"I believe that everyone's opinion deserves to be publicized fairly. Just because one person's view is considered to be right, doesn't mean another is wrong. What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 be informative to another.     I've read a lot of books that parents @MONTH1 not pick out for their children. In reading these books I see that there is no glamour in doing drugs or getting in trouble with the law. For some teens, books like these can show them the side of life they haven't experienced and find that they never want to.     If a book is too explicit for children, simply place the book in another section. I realize that there are books with graphic sexual details, and those should only be premitted to be checked out by adults. Parents should have concerns about their children's innocence. But I also believe that they should watch over what type of books they're reading too monitor the vulgarity of them.     Some @CAPS1 contain profanity or sexual induendoes, some contain praise and worship, others even have screaming. Any of thses type of musics can be found offensive by someone. That doesn't mean to run off and hide all of them. There'd be no @CAPS1 left.     Not everyone shares the same opnions in this world, therefore there should be equal opportunity for people to read,watch, or listen to whatever suits them. I'm not saying that there should be a stock of porn in the library, but if there are movies or books about shunned religions or beliefs then they should be just as welcomed as the ones about common religions and beliefs.     Everyone finds different things offensive. If there was a bible in the library and someone found it offensive, should it be removed? It's one of the most popular books in the world, yet some people still find offense by it. Someone who is mormon, muslim, or athiest might find offensive if there is nothing in the library about them because some people find it offensive.     The library is a place of knowledge, not judgement. I dont't believe that certain books should be removed from the library if they offend someone. If you don't like something that is at the library, don't rent it. If you don't want your children to, don't let them. Simple as that. Everyone is entiled to freedom of speech. Authors express themselves through books and articles, directors through movies, and musicians through their music.",4,4,4,2
4249,2,"I believe that people should not be able to remove books, movies, magazines, etc. from shelfs of the libraires. If someone takes a movie, book or magazine offensive they should contact the auother of the pieace and can complain or give their thoughts. Even if someone does find someones work in a wrong way, people have their own opionons and thoughts about everthing in life and are allowed to voice their bellifs and disbeilfs. Also, people can read on the front or back of other peoples work which summarize what the work is going to be about or what the work is talking about. People can decide then if the would like to read or watch further into it. Everyone in this country is allowed to say what they think and if someone takes the time to get their voice published then others might want to hear what others think. People can disagree, no one has to agree with anything anyone says. It is alright to not agree with another person says but everyone does have the right to stand up and say what they think about the situation. For example if my coaches were to tell me that they think im doing something wrong in gymnastics or they think something doesn't look good when I do, I let them speak. I let them tell me what they think would look better or would give more points. Then after they're done talking I give my thoughts and say '@CAPS1 I think this because this' I try to reason with them. For one its more respectful and for two everyone can have their own thought about something. And who knows they actually might be right if you give them a chance to speak. But, if you really don't like what another pieace of work might say you can always not read what they wrote, or watch what they produced. There is no need to be rude. If you strongly diagree you can always write your own book or publish an article voicing your own thoughts, that way someone can diagree or agree with how you feel about a certain subject. That is why I feel that they should keep all books, magaiznes, movies on shelfs. Everyone is allowed to express themselves and explain their actions toward a certain matter.

4250,2,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern:     The idea of censoring books, music, movies, or anything else from libraries or from the public eye is very offensive. There are many things that could come off as 'offensive' to any individual. Taking books or anything off the shelf because someone felt that it did not go with their certain morals or beliefs is against the writer's freedom of speech. It also can start serious issues with feuding religious groups or persons of different ideas. This also shows that the library, or so far as the country, is under one certain idea and other ideas that conflict with that will be oppressed.      One of the biggest concerns is that the freedom of speech is taken away. It @MONTH1 be something as trivial as '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' now, but if people keep taking books off the shelf because they find something wrong with it, then our freedom is taken away. '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' was brought up because a mother had actually gotten a certain book of the '@CAPS1's @PERSON1?' @CAPS4 taken off the shelf, because her child had gotten scared of the halloween edition. The fact that something could be banned for something so trivial is a frightening thought. There weren't many cases of this specific @PERSON1 scene scaring all the kids, so there was no need to get it banned. When someone finds something even a tad wrong they want it banned and thrown away, never again allowed to be shown to those that @MONTH1 even find an interest in it.     A big thing that @MONTH1 conflict with censorship is the idea of religion. The @CAPS5 is a published work, whether it is religious or not. Who's to say that it can't be banned? What if someone of a different religion found it highly offensive? This could cause even more conflicts between religious parties, and in turn anything religious would be banned all together. That small, faint line between state and religion is going to get blurred solely from censorship. If the @CAPS5 or works for catholics get banned, then so could published works for wiccans, muslims, buddhists, and any other sources of religion. There would be nothing for a religious or spiritual person to find comfort in. Not to mention the fear some publishers or authors will have in publishing their works. It will then become a topic far less talked about, for they would be afraid of getting into legal or social trouble for expressing their thoughts and feelings with their spirituality or religion.     This censorship will only cause future issues. This could lead to not only the religious books being banned, but anything that strays from the social norms. If someone was homophobic, they @MONTH1 start having a gay author's works banned, or just a book about the @CAPS7 community banned. That small sense of security those in that community have in those books will be taken away. Personally, I find comfort and my sense of being alone is dulled by these books. There @MONTH1 even be a possibility that some books, not necessarily just @CAPS7 books, hold someone up from that pit of depression they are so close to. It is a world someone loves to enter, to hide or confide in. To take someone's mental safety is worse than taking their physical safety.     Most people do not realize what sort of trouble they will start with censorship. It @MONTH1 mean nothing, but those that decide whether or not to censor something have to think of the picture at large; Do they lose customers for keeping it on the shelf? Or do they lose customers, and stop giving the rights of freedom of speech? It is a heavy decision to make but the decision could make or break the publishing group or legal party",5,5,5,3
4253,2,"the author ketherine paterson is like letting you know like life is going to dont be behain go forword and grab the book from the shelf fot you and for your children because most of the book are gone because other people got them. i would go to the library and grab the book from the shelf for me and my kids. mom can grad some good books for the kids like a book that have the parts of the body grammer so they can start learning something rite no that they are lilttle and they will ganna star to make sentences.in @DATE1 in warsaw school the principal decide to remove everything from the library because people didnt go and check out books,music,movies,megazines, etc he decide to remove them because people didnt check out nathing and most of the people put everything in obserbation but my question is why people didnt check out something for their kids so they can start to read to learn something from their moms school. in my  opinion if i would the principal of the school i wouldnt take of the books nathing about the library i would live everything so they can grab the books from the shelf and check them out so the kids start to lear how to read they ganna learn something special from their mom.",1,1,1,0
4254,2,"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right",4,4,4,2

Just because u dont like it doesnt meen somebody else doesnt.  I mean think about it is there a @CAPS1 or a song or a sintance thats so terrible that you need to take it off the shelf i say no.  Also beacuse somebody might have not got to read see or listen to that @CAPS1 song or book ya no what i mean.  Plus all that money and time and hard work it took to make the song, book or @CAPS1 it takes up to like almost @NUM2 years for a @CAPS1 to come out and when a song comes out u hardly even no its new because they never tell you like listen to bullet for my valentin's new song on @NUM3 or anything and when a new book comes out it's usually like harry potter or somthing like that but no, no @CAPS1 should ever be takin off the shelf's nor book nor music nor magizine.                                                                                                          @ORGANIZATION1",2,2,2,0

Now , with that done and said ; I would like to explain , and point out why we as people of @ORGANIZATION1 should overcome together and take books , music , movies off the shelfs . Drugs , crime , violance, movies , and etc .  Rappers most of the time rap about female ,killing people , and etc. Its doesn't mean that they do it , but it reflects on majority of our children . Music is heard everyday @NUM1 hours throughout televison , radio , and i pods . Its take it to even an  different level with to male gender . Calling female out of there name treating them how they were tought through music.     If they not listening to it , they  for sure watching it .Alot of the  problems come from letting children watching the wrong rating movies . Rated @CAPS1 is want they our now letting children watch ,and buy . So now its giving then a greater chance of failling life . So now we at two stikes with this stuff that we allowing our children to pick up off a shelf .   #@NUM2 thing we let them pick up and grab  is video games . @PERCENT1 of our children play video games . While the same time as we cant stop them making them , I strongly belive we can prevent from letting children buy them at the age level .Most of the games based on sex , drugs , violances , and languages. At this point children our taking it very  serious , and strongly believing they can do the same . Which leading to death or jail . Drug use , school dropouts , and crime rates our highly because of these same video games children our getting off the shelf. Strongly influncing  them to  grown up fast , skip over the childhood life . So why can't we do it ? I don't understand why we can't do it , when we have the power to . It will help us out so much for everybody future . Crime rate will go down , test scores will aprove , and our future will be brighter . For our sake , and our children .",3,3,3,1
4261,2,"I believe that censorship within libraries and any other public media source is wrong, immoral, and unfair. Authors, artists, phtographers, etc. have the right to freedom of speech. Why should the consumers not have the same right to choose what they expose themselves to? The censorship of any media should not be allowed in public consumer spots, not only because it goes against basic american rights, but it also takes the responsibility, originality, and expression out of @CAPS1' lives.      If a parent or gaurdian did not wish for their child to be exposed to certain genres of certain media, isn't it their responsibility to intercept that from their childs environment? If a parent really abhors a certain genre, then it is up to that parent to create a surrounding in which they feel that their child is safe. It is understandable that some genres of music, magazines, books and movie contain material that @MONTH1 be too graphic or mature for reader of a certain age, but situations like this in today's world is unavoidable. In my experience, I know that when I was to young to understand the happenings of @NUM1, my parents intercepted the stories from me. My parents turned off graphic or violent television when I walked in the room. They felt that this sort of material was inappropriate for someone at age @NUM2, so they exerpted that material from my environment. When you become a parent, you take on responsibility for the life of another person. This responsibility includes the childs health, safety, and his/her surroundings. Why can't @LOCATION1 leave the parenting of children to the parents?     When children turn into teenagers and teengers become adults, they earn many privelages. They earn the right to drive, then the right to vote, then the right to drink responsibly. There is a maturity level that goes into making descisions on your own; if you are mature anough to decide who you want to run your country, how could you not be mature enough to decide something as insignificant as music choice? Authors, artists, composers, and phtographers, all by living in @LOCATION1, all have the right to the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. By censoring what products are published and put in public takes away that right. Some @MONTH1 argue that the artists and authors still have the right to express themselves, but they are expressing material that is to risque or graphic to promote. This is an understandable point, but who is the government to promote only what they want to promote? Why should the government have total control over the @CAPS1 are exposed to? If this were to happen, could it easily be taken too far by power hungry poloticians? Wouldn't @LOCATION1 no longer be a democracy, but rather a communist country, like @LOCATION2?     American prides itself in being a 'mixing pot', and being accepting. If @LOCATION1 were to be like @LOCATION2, that would mean the restriction of expression and originailty throughout the country. Would you really want to live in a country where originality isn't really original, and acceptance was only what the goernment decided was acceptable? Would you be proud to live in a place where people don't have the opportunity to express themselves to others freely? I wouldn't.      Although the censorship of media through a library is only on a small scale, but censorship is censorship. It is discrimination agaisnt composers of a certain genre of works. It is the removal of choice from @CAPS1' lives. It is denying the composers their right to freedom of speech. Whichever way you look at it, censorship is censorship, and censorship is wrong",4,5,4,2
4262,2,"Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music , movies , and other things for entertainment. Mainly children use the library more than any other age. The library is a place where you can be humble and relaxed. No one wants to check out thinks that are offensive in any type of way. Not even books that will influence bad things. Therefore certain things shouldn't be allowed to be checked out in libraries.     Certain movies shouldn't be in the library. For example if a  child go to library they @MONTH1 see a movie that contains sexual activity and decided to check the movie out. The kid @MONTH1 be  underage and the movie would be considered inappropriate. The child @MONTH1 get in trouble by there guardian. In reality it would be the librarian's fault for letting the child check the movie out. That is why the movies should be censored.     On the cover of many magazines women as well as men bodies are exposed.That @MONTH1 cause children to be attracted to the magazine. They @MONTH1 even decided to check the magazine out. Children are influenced by the things they see. Seeing naked bodies would be considered setting a bad example.      In today's world all children listen to music. The music you listen to has a huge impact on your life. The music in libraries should be censored. Libraries should have music that encourage you to go out and be something in life. In my opinion only influential music should be able to be rented out.     Reading is the key to success. Libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you. Not the books that will talk about sexual things or even make you wonder about sex. Libraries should only have history, math , and educational books.     In conclusion everything in the library should be censored. A lot of children use the library. Therefore it should be age appropriate. No child needs to be put under a bad influence. Certain thinks should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion.",4,4,4,2
4267,2,"Imagine a library without any materials that are considered offensive.  In this library you wouldn't find many of the great pieces of literature that have impacted and influenced society @DATE1.  You probably wouldn't find too many books, magazines, or movies that everyone in the @CAPS1 feels that are appropriate.  Some of the great classic novels have contents that could be considered offensive to many people.  Offensive materials should remain in libraries @DATE1 because something that is offensive to one person might not be to another person, who could be impacted by the piece of literature that is being banned.  Music should also remain in libraries because the artist did not put the lyrics in the song to bring the listeners attention to the offensive material.  Also offensive materials have made an impact in society for ages.     First, materials that one individual finds offensive could be viewed another way by many others who enjoy the material.  Some comedy and action movies are viewed as offensive or inappropriate to some people, but many others @MONTH1 enjoy the movie.  If a movie, book, or magazine has the topic of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, it could be considered offensive to people who were a part of it, but it could also inform the reader or the person who is watching about the events that happened.  If children want to see or read this material they should get permission from their parents first.     Next, all music should remain in libraries.  The music was created by an artist who made it for enjoyment and entertainment.  The purpose of the music is not to bring the attention of offensive material to the listeners.  The lyrics in some songs are innapropriate for children, but parents should not let their child listen to them.  Lyrics can deal with really mature things that should only be heard and understood by adults.     Last, offensive materials have impacted society for ages.  Many things the founding fathers of the @LOCATION1 did were considered offensive, but that did not make them wrong, and it made the @CAPS1 a better place @DATE1.  Offensive materials impact everyday life for better and worse.  If all offensive materials were banned, they wouldn't be able to have an impact on @CAPS1 for better.     In conclusion, offensive materials should remain in libraries @DATE1.  The materials @MONTH1 be controversial, but they still are pieces of literature that deserve to be read and studied by the people of the @CAPS1.  Offensive materials contain many teaching tools in life that could help out the lives of many people.  The @CAPS1 would turn into that of the @CAPS1 in @PERSON1's novel @CAPS4 @NUM1, where all books were burned and society was not intellegent at all, if offensive materials were taken out of libraries @DATE1.",4,4,4,2
4268,2,"I think that some books should be banned from libraries that are offensive or use certain words against people, I think that should apply to highschool libraries because it really would matter in elementeries because they wouldn't know what some things mean. If a class were to read an offensive book and someyone in the class from the opposite race that reads the book others could get affended and it could start a fight.     Some high schoolers could get affended quicker than others and which could cause a lot of problems so by avoiding that there should be votes on books that should be banned or not be aloud to be read in class or in school period. Im pretty sure people would think its dumb to ban books but trust it me it would solve a lot of problems, but it all comes down to whats acceptable and whats not without hurting other peoples feeling and putting them down.     I bet all the time in classes theres been a story that has been read that has talked about races which makes others not feel comfortable, and theres always that person that always trys to make fun of something, but if I were in this situation I would try my best to not let others get to me and interfer with my grades and performance. I would just ignore them as much as possible and if it did start getting annoying I would talk to my counselor about trying to talk to that person individually or just removing me from class. I'm pretty sure most schools wouldnt tolerate this type of behavior but you will always have those kind of kids you just have to ignore.               You should never not go to school thinking you don't fit in just because someyone is making fun of your race or how you look. They just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of",3,3,3,1
4278,2,"Certain books should be removed from, the library because of the materials an  the stuff they show to younger children. One reason they should thake those books of is because some of the are racist against some cultures. Another reason is that some of the books or movies etc., would have things in them that young children shouldnt be looking at or reading. A final reason is that some books just shouldnt be in the librayies at all.     The first reason was that the books should be taken out of the library is because their racist. They should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things. Also they can teach the children how to treat people different because their reading those books from hte library. They would also get  he wrong idea about peopple  and different cultures.     Second reason why they should get rid of that bad stuff in the libraries is because they would have things in their that young children should not be wacthing or reading. Like they shouldnt have movies with killing and drug dealing or about drinking or anything a child shouldnt be looking at. It gives the children the wrong idea and they will think its okay becasue they seen it in the movies or read it in a book.     Final reason is that they shouldnt just have those things in a library at all or should just have place for where the young kids cant use them. Or they would need a parent or sombody thats eightteen so they wouldnt be able to just get these bad books or movies.     In conclusion libraries shouldnt have books or music or magazines or movies in them at all. They give kids wrong ideas an make them think that its cool or the right thing to do cause they saw it in a movie or read it in a book. That doesnt make it the right thing to do thats why they should get rid of that stuff.",4,3,4,2
4279,2,"Keep it on the shelvesThe reason for libraries is so that people can read what they want to read. If I owned a library I would have everything on the shelves because there are alot of people and not everyone likes the same thing. Truthfully I wouldn't care because it isnt just about a handful of people it is about everyones feelings. If people started taking certain things out of there book stores libraries it would eventually get out of hand. The reason it would get out of hand is because a certain topic like slavery if someone wanted to learn about it or enjoyed reading topics like that it wouldnt be fair because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people might find it offensive to put stuff out there for the public like that.     Everyone has their own opinion but why express your own opinion if the subject you want to express it under isn't harming anyone physically or emotionally. If everyones opinion was heard and taken into consideration tghe world as we know it would be boring and outragous. People like action and adventures, others like laid back kind of stuff. Why take things from people that they have had for a very long time if its just going to start a conflict and change the way people live everyday life. Maybe it could turn out in a good way but really what are the chances of that @NUM1 billion to a thousand.                           Things that are offensive to some people are very interesting to others so keep everything on the shelves. If only certain people are going to complain about it its not really a big deal. Maybe someday when everyone in the world agrees on @NUM2 reasoning then we could change it but i really dont see that happening anytime soon. The main reason is there is always going to be conflict between @NUM3 or more groups of people. Everyone cant be happy at the same time i say who cares weather something offends someone or not thats their opionion and until alot more people are seeing it and can stay on the shelf for the people that actually enjoy that kind of stuff.",3,3,3,1
4284,2,"No I @CAPS1 not believe there should be any censorship in libraries. We have freedom of speech for a reason.

4287,2,"A library is safe haven. A place people can go to escape the world and stick their head into a book. It is a place filled with knowledge and information. You can find information on anything in a library, from any point of view. Information in libraries should not be censored, even if the information is considered offensive.     A library should not be biased. Removing certain information from a library would be biased to whatever group believes in that knowledge. Whether or not something is offensive, the information should be out there for one to learn about if he chooses. Having information in a library that @MONTH1 be offensive does not mean a person is oblidged to read it. Katherine Paterson brings up a good point when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...and you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. If everyone could remove a book that offended them, there would be no books left.      There are many different views on many different subjects and everyone should have the opportunity to be educated on others' points of views. For example, there are many different religions in the world. Many of the religions have very conflicting points of views and some of their view points @MONTH1 offend each other. That does not mean that we should not provide information on different world religions simply because a person from another religion @MONTH1 be offended. Every person that goes to a library should have the right to educate themselves on others' religions. If we censored all the books that offended people, we would live in a very uneducated world.     A library is a place of education and learning. It is a place one can go and learn about any subject he chooses. If libraries censored information, then it would no longer be a place that is unbiased. It would hold a sway to a certain group of people and therefore, no longer be a safe haven for all to go and escape the world. One could not go to a library and get different points of views on every subject. Censorship on books and other materials in libraries would be a very negative thing.",4,4,4,2
4300,2,"Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we @MONTH1 have never thought about before.  However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read?  Well think what you @MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts.  Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be.  Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right.     Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people?  If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library?  Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they @MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning.  These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they @MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyones benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education.         Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them.  With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better.  Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for.  The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics.  Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people @MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well.     Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in @LOCATION1,and hopefully globaly someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit.  People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance.  Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1.  Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them.  Would he have become such a hit if others didn not believe this as well?  To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed.       People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies.  These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives.  Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it.  We all certainly would not be the people we are @DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only dehabilatating ourselves.   These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever",4,5,4,2
4304,2,"In every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste. Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, @MONTH1 be something that someone might want to know about. So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways? Here is what I believe we should do.     Books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone. They each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written. There are tons of books out there that many people dont like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't. We should keep the books in the schools and in libraries, because @MONTH1 be they might help someone in a way and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was avalible?      One thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre, so that way people know what they are looking for. Many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly. If each book was put into a certain category then that incedent wouldn't happen. It also helps keep everything organized that way. So when you go into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that @MONTH1 be offensive to you.     Keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do. That is the main reason for libraries. They help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else. If every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library? There would be nothing left.      In all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason. If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldnt have put it out there for the world to see. So keeep the books on the shelves",4,4,4,2
4309,2,I don't think certin matrials should be removed from library shelvs. People have the option to get what they choose from the shelvs the lirarians don't force them to choose the item.

How can your music get banned in the land of the free. I think that there should be no way that any thing can banned in a liberary there should be no such thing. And how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad. I know that there are some movies and magazines that parents dont want there children seeing. So dont censor it still have it just make it where you got to be a certain age to see that movie from a liberary. There should be no sensorship in the land of free speech. How would we be call the land of the free if we are censoring everything. That is why i dont think we should censor anything in @LOCATION1.,2,2,2,0

Everyday, whether they read a book or not they are still exposed to vulger behavior.       'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right ot remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us.' @CAPS1 quote by Katherine Paterson also helps understand the concept. If someone were to take a book off of a shelf at their home, a public library, or maybe even a store that they found offensive at any point in the book, then there would be no books left for children and even adults to read.  In every book there is some form of material that people @MONTH1 not be a fan of.  There would soon be nothing left.      There isn't a day that goes by that a kid doesn't hear something offensive.  Even at school, where it's supervised, children bring words that they have heard their parents say or things that they have seen their parents do, and they share them with other kids.  You can't protect them from every small encounter they are faced with.      Some books are by far more offensive than others, but are you going to give a kid a book that has vulgar language or, will you give a child a book that's about @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 running out of honey in his jar?  Most children don't go to a library or a store without super vision if their parent is @CAPS1 careful about just books.  Therefore, their parents probably aren't going to allow them to pick up a obscene book or magazine, and in fact they would probably try to hide it from them.     If a book is put on a shelf then it is there for those who enjoy that material.  If you can't make the world kid safe, then why would you try to make a library the same exact way.  There are other people out there that might find the very material that you that is offensive fascinating, and a library is there to suit everyone's needs.  It isn't there for just children.",4,4,4,2
4324,2,"I think that any book or movie should have some warning sighns apon it, to insure that all peaople know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything. sSome movies or books read or watched, should have an age limit too. Some of the things people find offensive, other people @MONTH1 not and if taken all of the stuff out of movies or books @MONTH1 cause people not to go see or read as much movies or books.      In alot of music some things might be offensive, but if you don't apriciate what they say in the song then dont listen to that group. There are some rap artist that say some things people might not like but, you dont have to listen to them there are alot more bands and diffrent kinds of music to choose from. It would b hard taken stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take alot of what the people want to see.     In magazines alot of people including i like hearing the trooth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies, that alot of people @MONTH1 not know. If parents dont like there children reading those kinds of books have them go buy a set that they will enjoy haveing there kids read.",3,3,3,1
4330,2,I believe that some materials in the libary should be taken off. Some people @MONTH1 find them offensive because they might have bad things in them. Some types of music have bad language in them and people dont want little kids finding them. If a little kid saw that stuff then they would learn bad things. And they would say it in front of everybody and then everybody would being saying it.     Alot of books are ok to read because they dont have bad things in them. some people like reading books that have drama and some people dont. Most books re ok to read. But some can have langauge in them and ahouldnt be aloud in the libary. But they can still be in there because some people might want to read them. If people dont want to read them then they shouldnt get them.     Some movies have bad stuff in there. That kind of stuff should not be in there because alot of people dont want to watch movies like that. And if a kid would walk in there and get one and if it had that stuff and the parent fount out then the libary could get sewed for having that stuff. So they should be taken out of the libary so people wont get them. The libary can keep children movies in there to watch because they are not bad.     If i worked at a libary then i would take magazines out. Sports magazines would be ok to keep in there. But alot of the others ones should not be there because they have alot of bad things in there and i wouldnt let people take them so i wouldnt have them in there. But sports and stuff would be ok because sports are not bad for people to read. People like reading about sports because it is interesting to read.     That is just what i thank. Other people might see it the other way and they can. People are different and they will thank different things. Some people might want to read that and some people dont. So it just shows you that people are different because they thank things different then other people do. And some libaries have that stuff and some dont. sp if you are one of those people that like that stuff then go to one of them that have that stuff. And if you are one of those people that dont then go to one that dont have that stuff so you can get what you want and they can get what they want,3,3,3,1
4332,2,"The library is a public place. Everyone is allowed acces to the library. It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there. Since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.     Genres were created for a reason. Certain items have different forms to them. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock, and blues are some examples. Since music is categorized in such a way, there should  be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive.     In the @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear @CAPS3 a part. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library.     Another freedom given to the @CAPS2 people is the freedom of press. Anything put onto paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasising about school, it is all legal. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable. Like music, books have many categories. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what.     Movies are located at libraries as well. They are categorized just as much as books and music. The term ' @CAPS5 judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes. This can also be used with movies. The title of a moive or book will tell what it is about. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated @CAPS6 or @NUM1. These ratings help censor things to a certain extent. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated @CAPS6 movie. It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. From books to videogames there are ratings and generes. If someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library. It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc inside a library. As long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem.",4,4,4,2
4334,2,"Do I think that books, movies, music or magazines should be removed from the library? No I don't I think that should be removed only because if you remove them your probably going to lose more costumer's.     I'm going to be honest here, most people like to read. I know I sometimes read to study and if they got rid of the books that I read to study. How would I study? Even teachers go to the library to study or to even get books, or maybe get books for there grand kids or there kids. Parents do the samething.      People don't understand that music helps everybody some point in time. I know people who listen to music to help them consentriate on different things like homework, regular work, or even being stressed out. There are alot of different ways that music helps alot of people. If people decided to feel offensive over stuff like that then something is wrong with them because after all these years there have been no complaints.     Honestly i have never got movies or magazine's from the lilbrary before. People do it for there kids or grand kids, I don't really see the big deal. Its not like they are watching anything bad. They mostly have kid movies not bad ones.     Why would people want to take little thing like that from little kids? In a way that makes me mad because I like little kids they don't hurt anybody.",3,3,3,1
4336,2,"I dont believe that we should sencor or take away any thing off of out library shelves that seems either offensive or inappropriet for veiwers, but I wouldent recomend it for the kids who are not ready for that sort of material untill they are at the age of where they are ready for that sort of viewing.     The reason why I say this is because that I believe and know that people sooner or later are going tho see, hear, and go through that sort of that viewing and/or experience sometime in their lives, it has happend to many people and it will continue to happen to everyone in their lives.     The events that happen to many people are awful but yet are true, @CAPS1 that go around in the world should be known to other people and why, so people can know how to deal with the situation or at least know what to do, we should know how to go-by when some cerntian events go through like an example; if a cerntian person of race and is minding his own bisnuess passes a group of race appressers and they began offending him by words then he shouldent worry. Because if a person is only going to constantly use words then you should know that he/she is just a weak person just trying to get on your nervs and wont do any physical harm to you.     There are many @CAPS1 that people dont like and try their best to hide it from others, but that would only make @CAPS1 worse for everybody and would lead them clueless if some people got exposed to what some people attend to hide; We shouldent hide @CAPS1 from others and keep them from not knowing what has happend or what is going on and leaving them clueless.      I believe that nothing should be held back for the people who are ready to see or know what is going on, no matter how crule or painful it is, they should know what it is and how to take care of them selves when thell experience it at first hand.",3,3,3,1
4337,2,"Censoring @CAPS1     We all know that language is the foundation of human legacy.  Language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate.  To take books from the shelves is to steal the words from the mouths of many great speakers.  We have the obligation to keep the @CAPS1 that we have created alive.  If something is forgotten, it is as if nothing happened. If nothing happened, it will reoccur- good or bad.     To hide away words from our children is wrong.  If not by word of print, word of mouth will lead them to the same discoveries as they would have come to if reading it from a book.  But even more importantly, what good is hiding the truth?  When many speak of tragic incidences, they speak, '@CAPS2 forget.'  If we should not forget, why should the youth @CAPS2 learn?  There is nothing in print that can not be conveyed in a different communication form.     Our @CAPS1 is written on the pages of literature.  The books we read are the property of all humanity and should be read by all to educate us of our mistakes as well as our triumphs.  A commonly debated topic in the world of censorship is 'The @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5.'  @CAPS6 is a novel that displays what life was truly like in one of @LOCATION1's most racially barbaric times.  One might argue the fact that it uses an offensive 'n' word more than a few times.  To @CAPS6 one might argue that @PERSON3, the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that stood by @PERSON2 was loved by @PERSON2.  A book in @CAPS6 time displaying a friendship between a black and a white man is truly a ground breaking feat.  The 'n' word was common place in @CAPS6 time period- a friendship between a black man and a white man was not.  Is it really important that a child knows of just another offensive word that they are bound to discover eventually anyway, or is it more important that they learn that color of skin does not change a person?  Do not take the opportunity for a child to learn what really matters away.     To take one book away is to take all of them away.  Censoring one piece of literature opens the doors of debate for every other piece ever created.  The world has seen what can happen when things get censored.  During @PERSON1's dictatorship, nearly everything from the internet, to books, to newspwpers, to television programming, to movies, to music, to magazines were censored so only what the dictatorship wanted got through.  The people were brainwashed, and those who were not rose up, and when they did they were shot down.  Do not let the world come to that.  We are better than that and our literature shows it.     In other words, to censor media and the literature that surrounds us, we deprive ourselves of education and freedoms that are critical to the well being of future generations.  Do not hide the free speech of authors, do not hide our @CAPS1 from our children, do not let us make the same mistake that has been made before.  Let us educate our children for the future of humanity.  Let our @CAPS1 not repeat itself. Let us innovate and create a new, better world.  Let us allow our words to flow freely.  Let us allow our legacy to live on.",5,4,5,3
4346,2,"I don't believe that any certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc; Should be removed from the libraries shelves, because any thing can be offensive. What if someone needed to resourch about the @NUM1? Well they really won't be able to, if all the books about @NUM1 were taken off the shelves, only bacause someone found it offensive. Now days, everything is offensive to somebody.      For this, people need to understand that it is what it is, and if you were not appart of that problem, then what do you need to worry about. This day and age is evil all around the world. There are going to be things happening that are going to make people feel a little offensive. Just like all the earthquakes around the world, I know that there is some people offensive about that, but what if somebody was in college, and they wanted to learn more about what happened, so maybe they can get a group of people, and make there lives better.      People are hurting and I understand that, but us people are not here to judge, we are here to help the poor, and the sick, get by with what they have, and just help them see that there is a way out. With all this said I don't believe that we should remove the books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves in libraries.",3,3,3,1
4349,2,"Some materials in libraries @MONTH1 have information that is offensive towards others.  But should they be removed if they are found offensive? Some people believe that they should be removed depending on how bad the offense is. But materials @MONTH1 be removed if it is sexual, racist, or life threatening offense.     Some material @MONTH1 have offensive comments that is sexual. If its an offense that is sensored and the author or artist of the material went too far, then that @MONTH1 be a good reason for the material to be removed.  It @MONTH1 make the person feel emotions that bring them down.  It @MONTH1 also make the person feel violated and offended.     There @MONTH1 be material that has racist comments.  Racism is one of the biggest conflicts in the world today.  It is something that starts fights and arguements.  It also causes individuals to feel bad about themselves.  Racism can cause people to feel very hurt also. So if there is too much racism in a material, then that should be removed.     There are some material that @MONTH1 have offense that seems life threatening.  Say that it is a book about the whole nation and the author slips in something that @MONTH1 seem like the nation would be in danger, someone @MONTH1 feel offended and want that material removed.  Material with too much threat in it @MONTH1 make one feel like their life is in danger or like something bad is going to happen.  They would feel a life threatening offense and want it to be removed from the shelves.     So should offensive materials be removed from the shelves? Yes they should.  If they were to be found sexually, life threatening offense or had racist comments, they should be removed so individuals won't feel these offenses are life threatening, hurtful, or cause negative emotions",3,3,3,1
4350,2,"Taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech.  There is not a point to it. People in this country have the right of speech. Along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard.  An author's opinions @MONTH1 be offensive to some but does that mean he or she should not have a voice?  Writers get their ideas from somewhere society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjer up, taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly citizens of the @LOCATION1 have the right to make their own choices; that being if you don't like a book don't check it out.     Writers @MONTH1 state things that to some degree @MONTH1 offend one in a million people.  Others see it as freedom of speech and writing.  An author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders.  But if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing.  Some books @MONTH1 be fictional but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else.  Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers.  So when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it they got it from the way people truly are in the world.       Banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provacitive language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words. Kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex.  Reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways.  If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves society still will not change.  There is no perfect society.     Setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone.  If an idividual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing that person should not check that author's books out from the library.  No single person is forced to read a book they are offended by.  Getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence. The library is not liable for the feelings of the readers.  If the reader does not like the book they are able to close it.  No one has glued their fingers to it.       Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to.  Banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things.  Society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere, taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if some one does not like a book they should not read it",4,4,4,2
4354,2,"Have you ever picked up a piece of material while in a library and it offended you? Would you want your children reading, watching, or hearing stuff that was offensive towards them? I don't think no parent wants that. Think about it, how do children have access to things like that? Is it all around or do children go and find it? Not every single child in @LOCATION1 is going to be protected from bad materials.     Most of the time after school, children stay in the house and do stuff instead of going outside. Inside of their house they have access to televison, computers, and music. They think why go outside when I have all this stuff inside? Truth be told children hear so much harmful things from everywhere and anywhere. Nothing is censored like it was back in the day. Now a days nobody cares if materials are offensive, just as long as they sell. That's not the way it suppose to be at all, everybody should want best for the children and young teens. People wonder why their is violence, bad attitudes, crimes, etc., because all the stuff we have access to.          Schools could help prevent this probelm by removing offensive materials off the shelves in the libraries. It's sad that type of material is available in a school, but thats how the generation is today. In a library only certain things should be done. Reading, using computers, working at a table. Children shouldn't be able to get on a computer and play games, or listen to music with bad words in it, or prehaps pick up a dirty magazine. Library should be a place for learning, doing work, and reading. If their is less offensive materials in a school enviorment that's one step into fixing this problem. Censorship is much needed everywhere, it would help out a lot",3,3,3,1
4355,2,"The common phrase 'knowledge is power' accurately paints the situation at hand. Through censorship in libraries, which are meant to allow free access to all media-related materials, we take away the opportunity for people to empower themselves through knowledge. The reasons for not censoring media in libraries are numerous and include, but are not limited to, unconstitutionality of censorship, the lack of proper definition for 'offensive', and the contradiction censorship poses to the core of what a library is.      The first, and most blatant, reason for not allowing the censorship of materials in libraries is the unconstitutionality of the matter. Freedom of speech and freedom of press are both protected by the constitution upon which our country was founded. Censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights. Authors, illustrators, journalists and the slew of other individuals who compose the materials available in libraries are exercising their right to free speech through their works. They are constitutionally protected in the things they say. Notice that @CAPS1 have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended. The freedom of press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world. They are utilizing their free speech by means of press. Censoring library materials would be limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the @LOCATION1. This would be a clear failure to uphold the rights of the citizens. For this reason, we cannot censor libraries.      The constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well. There is no adequate legal definition of 'offend'. People could be offended by something as serious as a personal attack on their beliefs and personal entity or something as light as a personal distaste for certain mindsets and ideas. So, because all men are equal, we would have to respect the 'offense' taken by all people and to all degrees. This leaves every single work of art, whether it be a book, movie, magazine or any other form provided by libraries, open to the fickle definition of offensive and vulnerable to the personal feelings of every individual. If said offense taken by individuals to works is able to mark a work as 'offensive' and thus make it open to removal from libraries, we are effectively allowing citizens to undermine the rights of other citizens. This is something that cannot be allowed in our libraries.      The final core issue is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library. Censorship is meant to create a politically correct and non-offensive environment through the limitation of exposure to materials. Libraries, however, are meant to allow public access to works that stretch and challenge knowledge, beliefs, notions and all ideas held by people through the works of others. Censorship cannot be implemented without a clash with the essence of a library's purpose. If censorship were to be enacted, a library could not provide new information if someone else did not like what was being taught. A library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred. Pre-conceived notions could not be defeated with the presence of factual knowledge if someone did not like the truth. In all of these ways, and many more, a library's core ideals and purpose could not be upheld with the induction of a system of censorship.      All in all, we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by. The constitutional rights of citizens would be infringed upon, the fickle nature of humans and the lack of definition for 'offensive' would allow people to undermine the rights of others, and the essence of what a library really is would be ravaged. We cannot, as @CAPS1 with rights, employ a system of censorship",6,5,6,3
4358,2,"We all have our favorite books and some we like others @MONTH1 not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maby a book a friend recomended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are are bookes that are well liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away.     To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial shurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like @PERSON1 for example, @MONTH1 be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future.     Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has there prefrence on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others @MONTH1 not. If all books that are bad or offencive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendus it @MONTH1 be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them.     I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want",4,4,4,2
4361,2,"Are offensive materials offensive to everybody? Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who is to say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of. Children are going to see this material anyways, weither we take it away of not. Offensive material, such as cursing or rage, is a form of expression and of releaving stress. Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression.      Children will see and hear offensive things anyways. Even as it is now, parents try to hid such things from their children. this makes them curious. They will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are part of everyday life. The more you hid it, the more children will seek it out.     In movies, books, and music, this is a form of expression. it releaves stress, rage, and shows this so that @CAPS1 is a true picture of what is going on. People cannot imagion someone truly angery in a book when it says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'...' You cannot show foreshadowing, or show the anger. You cannot see how a character truly feels. For example, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will parish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'...' @CAPS1, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him.     In such ways, this can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or out of line. Cursing to me is not offensive. But, they show how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it. Offensive material can also grief. This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story. allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more. So the reader, watcher or listener would wait for more, and by the music, book, or movie. It puts intrest into the material.     Only certain people can agree on something offensive. Such as family, friends, or a group of close people. But, it applies foreshadowing, intrest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion. Your children will see it if they truly want to. So, why get rid of something that they will see anyways? Something that intersts them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music. Why would something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would grab promote and keep some within it",4,4,4,2
4365,2,"Katherine stated that if everyone had the right to take a book off the shelf then there wouldn't be any books left. I think what she is saying is that many people think of a book that is innappropriate, but in another persons eye the book could also be appropriate. Censorship is a big deal no-a-days. Nobody wants there young children to read about drugs and/or violence. I have many opinions upon this issue.     First I will state why I think the books, or movies, or whatever should be taken off the shelf. The books, movies, magazines, ect. should be taken off the shelf for being to innappropriate. The books and movies are innappropriate by having drugs, sex, violence, and many other things in them that young children shouldn't be subject to watching or reading. I know if I was a parent I would not want my young child reading of a violent murder, or gangs.      The other thing about censorship that it is the peoples choice to read an innappropriate book, or watch an innappropriate movie. As a kid myself that is growing up, I didn't really care for reading anyways, but the books that were the best sometimes were the ones with violence in them. Also even thought the book @MONTH1 be innappropriate, the child still should have a say in what they are reading. This is where my next thought comes in. You have to think about the kids that are mature too. The kids that are mature, and it is just a hobby to read, @MONTH1 not have any books of their style left to read if they were all 'taken of the shelf'. This goes for parents too. If they have a book at their house, the child could easily pick it up and read it there.     What the book stores, libraries, and movie stores should do, is put an age limit on the books and movies. I know that for @CAPS1 rated movies there is an age limit, but for explicit books i do not think there is an age limit. They could also maybe even get a letter or a note with parent concent on it, so the children could get the book or magazine. Maybe the parent should even just come in and get the book or movie for the child. The libraries, or book stores, or movie stores could also easily put a warning on the side of the cover to show that the book @MONTH1 be innappropriate to some. What the children read is only up to two people: the child and the parent. If the parent doesn't care that the child is reading or watching an innappropriate movie then it should be no problem.     Therefore, I think in order to withhold the buying and selling of books, there has to be the option to obtain the innappropriate ones. I feel that even though the material @MONTH1 be explicit, the kids, with their parent's concent, should have the option to check out or buy mostly anything. Afterall, the book @MONTH1 be about violence, drugs, or sex, but the children are still reading which is always good",4,4,4,2
4373,2,"Throughout time, fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive. It @MONTH1 be the way they were brought up, or simply what they beleive. I do not beleive that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves. Everyone has one life, and in this one life we create our personal oppinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right. We are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles, and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals, beliefs, and customs of everyone in the world.     If I came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then I should be able to read that as long as I don't influence others by their own will. Let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive, I do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing. There is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part.      I think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child. That is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else, because they have undeniable duties as parents, and they be able to say what is right knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind",4,3,4,2
4379,2,"There is many different topics that could be offensive, @CAPS5 just depends on the person's own personal judgement. In my opinion I do not believe that materials should be removed because not everyone has the same view or opinons. If someone comes from a different country or evern a different religion, topics like abortion and racism are going to be viewed very differently. I think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way.      When I am older and if one of my elementary children was to bring home a book over abortion, I would be concerned. Honestly though, I do not believe schools would let inapropriate topics for younger childeren read books like that. @CAPS5 is a little bit different with a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 student though. Their maturity level is going to be mature enough to handle the material and I do not think @CAPS5 is right for schools to remove something that could actually help someone.      In the book, 'A @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', there is a lot of detailed events that happen. Some might say @CAPS5 is too graphic for children but the reality of @CAPS5 is, events like those happen in today's society. @CAPS5 really opened up my eyes and I am extremely happy I read @CAPS5. The realization actually made me want to help those children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book. I believe @CAPS5 had the same effect on other people too and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation.      Libraries should be able to have a variety of different books. I am not saying however that they should have books on murder and saying @CAPS5 is alright but books that will help expand the children's minds. @CAPS5 could even change their lives. Some books are a sensitvie topic but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe? @CAPS5 would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs then having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in.      I have also read a book recently titled, '@CAPS6', @CAPS5 is about the government granting the ability to @CAPS6 your children and then the body parts will go to those in need. @CAPS5 is sort of cruel in one way but the topic the author is trying to get across is not. A quote from the book is, 'On one side you have people killing abortion doctors for the right of life and on the other you have people getting pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue'. @CAPS5 states that everywhere you go people are going to disagree and agree on things but not everyone will believe in the same thing. @CAPS5 shows that just because one person thinks one way is right does not mean another will. The book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes on different views.      Racism, abortion, @CAPS3 abuse, unwinding your children, what ever the case @MONTH1 be, some people will support @CAPS5 and some will not. I think @CAPS5 is time for children around the world to discover for themselves what they truely believe in and taking 'offensive' material from @CAPS2 libraries is not going to help any. My opinion on this topic is strongly advising to leave the material alone because for there to be a book about @CAPS5, the author had to have had a reason to write @CAPS5 and honestly, what is better for the future then a generation of children grounded to their own true beliefs",4,4,4,2
4383,2,I think that the cencorship in libraries should defenetly be relevant.  Such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk.  Many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow.  A cencory system should be a quit simple arrangment fot the public library systems. Private libraries can do as they choose they are not under any state law.  On the other hand public libraries are under state and city law they should not be able to show adult things to children.  For example in many libraries around the @CAPS1.S there all books called manga or anime books alot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated @NUM1+.  I think there could be many changes in the library systems it is your choice if  you want to change them or not,3,2,3,1
4385,2,"Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people doesn't like them, and finds them offensive is simply not fair.  A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy.                 A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think.  Simply regulating books, and other products, by creating age limits based on the books content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves.  Take an author like @PERSON1 for example.  His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people.  That being said censoring the books language wouldn't help in the slightest. If a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like @PERSON1 then they would have no problem making inferences on what matierial was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized.                  The other fact is that taking out mature level books completley from the libraries is not a possible solution either. If you take out the diversity in your product your going to lose the diversity in your customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie.                   So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book @MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever. Were all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality.",4,4,4,2
4388,2,"A curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read. Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is to busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it.      Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it.      By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.      Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.      Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.      In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to",4,4,4,2
4389,2,"I think that no source of knowledge should taken off any shelf in any librairy because a few people think it's offensive. In my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable. People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it. Some of the best books on our shevles are the ones that @MONTH1 be offensive.     Some books are racist; Of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks. If everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when i'm older. I know that all the older books would be gone to and then no one would know about what happened in the @NUM1's. Also some of the @ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse then the books people read,if you find a book offensive don't read it!     When i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it. It gives the book charactor and makes it humorouse. We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while. Sometimes from thoughs books you even learn something about your self that makes you wonder if i didn't read this book would i still have found this out. Sometimes it brings out the best in people and thats the best part about reading a book like that.     Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take that away from people. I want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out. If you ask me it's just not right to take away someone elses choice of knowledge. Thats my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries.",4,4,4,2
4391,2,"I believe that the certain materials such as books,music,movies, magazines, ect. they are here for a reason. People like them. Maybe there are some books and things that people @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not find offensive. Thats ok I'm not try to say it isn't, but you don't have to look at that book. There are so many others to pick from it doesn't have to be the first one you pick up. The objects we are talking about are our entertainment it brings us joy and many smiles. People need to understand that children are going to have to get their education not only from their teachers,but through these tools. Tools is a better word for these things. It makes them have a meaning.      Children now day love books, music,movies, magazines,ect. As a teenager I can say that most of us who like music we love it. It builds our charater. People don't make books and magazines just for them to sit on a shelf and gather dust. They were ment to be picked up and look at. I also have to say that some people make a big deal about a subject like this. Don't get me wrong I can understand were their opinon stands,but that doesn't mean I have to agree. Children,@CAPS1,and @CAPS2 all have to learn in one way or another. Some of these ways are what some people are trying to get removed from our libraries and other places as well.      If people want this is going to be a big war. Only because they are not the only people on the planet. People want these tools of ours to be removed this will only be the begin. Next couple of years from now people will want to get rid of something else then, something else. Its just one right after another it won't stop. This just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other. Everyone is intitled to their own opinion some are good and some are bad. In this case, my opinion I totally and completely disagree with getting rid of the tools that can inprove our world as we know it to be.",3,3,3,1
4392,2,"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. D     @CAPS1 you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station? Well, @CAPS3 you do. Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books.  @CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down. @CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well.     Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on.  Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away.      Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work.      I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and @CAPS4 helped me out, @CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do.      I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in theirlives.      Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check.  Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say.     If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me.      This makes me think of drama. People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come?  You must learn to deal with @CAPS4.     Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @PERSON1 book when there is a @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see @CAPS4. Not all of the world will care to see @CAPS4. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.'      @CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. @CAPS4's like the saying, '@CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like @CAPS4, you might even hate @CAPS4. But once @CAPS4's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with @CAPS4.     I think that just because someone picks up a book and @CAPS4 offends them, @CAPS4 doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves. Grow up, put whatever @CAPS4 is that offends you down, and walk away.",5,4,5,3
4394,2,"A place fill of knowleged should be a place where you can find all the news that is making the world what it is today, a person should be able to find out things from the past also. A library has many different things found in it: books, magazines, movies, and some have music. The books range from encyclopedia's to @PERSON1, the varity of books and information is to the extreme. But then again with all the good things there always comes a bad side of the information. With all the profanity found in today's society you would not want a child seeing or hearing any of it while at a public library.     Books are put into a library so that people have the chance to read them and become more knowledgable. The thought of a younger person going into the older, adult area is very upsetting but then again who's to say that that individual is not allowed to read an article or magazine that has more mature type's of information or language found in them. I feel that a person will see what they want to see and what they want to read, fact of the matter is they have the right to.      Both, young and older people need to be educated in the worlds past history and the present news. One reason being to prevent things that happend in the past, happening again. Another reason is just so that they know what is going on around them and so that the individual is informed.      Libraries should have banners or flaps up saying what is in a certain section of that specific area and people can make the decision to go over to those area's or not. Things that are found 'not right' in one's eyes @MONTH1 not seem so bad to anothers, it's all in personal preference. Things should still be out for the public to read or see.     Making the choice to go into a library is an individuals decision. Fact is that the library is a place where a person should be able to get knowledge, no matter what type of information.  A person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others.",4,4,4,2
4397,2,"Do i think that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, ect., should be removed from the shelves.? No i do not think that some of these materials should be removed. Why? because nowadays kids read things such as gang violevce and things that dont involve school material but some kids find the books that they read interesting. Now, do i thing that the books should be not given to students who are very young of age? Yes, due to the fact that some books are a little above others age of reading.     Sometimes you @MONTH1 have kids who are intrested in what others dont read. Books such as gang violence and drug abuse are some of those books in categories of which some cant read. I think that in this case kids under certain age shouldnt read these books because of some of the content that is involved in it. Kids find these books, movies and magazines interesting because many things that happen in the world today happen inside those books. Im not saying that its a good thing, but im saying that the things they read and see in those books and movies are things that some of us have seen in a everyday life.     When I was younger, I went to a library in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 and whenever a kid would choose a big that wasn't for hiim/her they would always say 'you need your parents permission to check this book or magazine ect. out'. Once I actually noticed and got the point of why they would do this I thought that it was a good idea. I figure that all libraries should be like this considering that kids shouldnt read books that arent for them. This is also a good way to get kids from reading things that not age appropriate to finding something that is.     So the main answer to this suggestion is, no, I dont think that these materials should be moved from shelves out of libraries. Why? because once they are gone then some kids might not even attend the library anymore because of the books that they find interesting are gone. So my suggestion is to not move them and let them stay on shelves just as any other book would",3,3,3,1
4398,2,"Do you believe that certain books, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelf in a library due to censorship? There are many times when you hear a parent tell their child not to look at that magazine because they don't want them to see the vulgar things on the inside. I've heard parents tell their children not to ever watch that movie because it'll show things that they don't need to be seeing. Almost every day we're put in situations like these, not knowing whether we should pick up the magazine or just leave it on the shelf. In my opinion, I believe that libraries should remove anything vulgar from the shelves. Kids are encouraged to go to the library as much as possible, but not if there is vulgar things on the shelves.     Kids are told many times a week by their parents, teachers, and other adults to go the library. They can work on their homework, read a book, or do some studying for school. When they get distracted from finding the book they want with a book that has vulgar things in it, they're going to be curious. The main reason I disagree with having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children. The last thing they need to be looking at is something that isn't appropriate for their age. It's hard for a child to turn down a movie or magazine they've never seen or looked at before.     In most libraries the adult section is seperated from the childrens section. This doesn't mean that a child can't over hear something that the adults are listening to or watching. The childrens section is made for fairytale stories and kid movies, but when the adult section has things going on over there that aren't the most appropriate then kids can over hear. If children and adults are going to be in the same library then I think they should make it completely impossible for children to veer over there and see what's new on that side of the library.     Another reason I think libraries should censor themselves more is because of teenages in the community. After school hours, a lot of teenagers in our community enjoy going to the library. If this is such a good environment for teenagers to be then why are they able to download bad music off of the internet?      Some teenagers listen to bad music with cursing, vulgar language, and much more. Libraries should make it impossible for teenagers to do this. If they want to download bad music then they need to do it somewhere else where youngers can't get ahold of any of it.      My last argument for this is a heads up for the parents. Parents should check out what stuff their kids are looking at when they go to the library. You might not think your child would look at something with vulgar things, but sometimes, they're curious. All children are and it's human nature to be curious. I, myself, would go with my child a few times just to see what's in the library and tell them not to take things off the shelves that look bad.      Some libraries can't completely fix everything. They can't take every bad or vulgar thing off of the shelves. In the quote it says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.', I can think of books and magazines that I  would never want any child to look at, especially at a young age. Libraries need to be more interested in taking vulgar things off the shelves so that younger children cannot get ahold of. It's one thing for a child to see a book or magazine that isn't necessarily appropriate, but in a library it's a completely different story",4,4,4,2
4405,2,"Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The material should be removed if they offend their gender. Also, the material should be removed if it offend's their religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offend's their race.     The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy. Second, the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text.     Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion. This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song writer, actor, and/or director. Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents not by offending someones religion. Finally, this can cause a person or people to act as terrostist from this offensive content.     The material also should be removed if it is offending someones race. First, the material @MONTH1 call the race of the person that is reading, listening or watching a name that's very offensive name( not directly but in general). Second the material can speak of the race as if was bad. Last, the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race.     The material that is offensive to anyones gender,religion, and/or race should be removed from the shelves of a library. the library is a place where everyone can read, listen, or watch about something that is interesting not to offend other people in all ways.",4,4,4,2
4406,2,"Often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available. In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background. Sometimes we come across a book or magazine that is innapropriete for children, and wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up. I believe materials that are offensive to some people should be permitted from the public library.     To begin, the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level. Libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre, but a young child @MONTH1 not be aware. I believe they're certain materials found in a library that should not be put out for the public. Perhaps you have a five year old child pick up a book about sex and drugs, this could lead the child to learn things they shouldn't know until they are older.      To continue, offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation. If someone were to come from out of town and the first thing they seen on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken back. Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first grader to see and also books about racial or religion. Certain people would take offense to a book that was against what they believed in. This could result in a huge confrontation.      Lastly, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic. If someone against the writer's opinion started to read the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer was saying. There is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something.      To conclude, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we have to be aware of what @MONTH1 cause problems to certain people. I believe any book open about opinion, and books that would be 'x-rated' should not be kept in a public library. We could easily solve this problem by making a seperate place to hold these books so people will not take offense to it.",4,4,4,2
4410,2,"I belive that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive.  If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, than many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves.  Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world @MONTH1 not teach them.  If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote.  If certian literature were not around anymore then it definitly would not be the same as it is now.  Literature are there for us, they teach us, and if if one @CAPS1 was taken away, it would start a riot.     Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality.  Imagine if you we not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society.  If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything.  Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non offending' society.  Lots of music would lose it's luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.'  Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart.     Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if its a lesson about what not to do while your young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking?  Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers.  They have problems just life people of the real world even though they @MONTH1 not be real themsleves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real life person decide on what they should do about there problem.  Important history books of movies could be taken away becaus it 'offends' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to have students learn about slaves.     If one @CAPS1 was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away form society.  What good does that do anyone?  It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about.  It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of aproppriateness.  If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now.  No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries.     Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keep us company, it teaches us, is makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down.  If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can chose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries.  They would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the @LOCATION1 and maybe even across the globe.  Information of any kind is a good @CAPS1 no matter the content of it.  So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea.",4,4,4,2
4411,2,"The content in todays materials are not always subtible for young children. Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games. By growing up in a violent enviornment, children observe and have the greater chance at becoming violent. The continuence of censorship in todays materials are a necessity to the well being of the children in todays society.     In video games there are ratings that help explain wat is subtible for each age throughout childhood and adolesence. Movies are also the same, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be. Age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games in todays world, and some of the influence it brings on children is unecessary and eventually detrimental to their well being.     The reason ratings should be changed is because children obsorb their enviornment and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they have a greater chance in becoming violent children. In libraries there are sections for every age group, specific genre of books, fiction, and non fiction. But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children. As a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary.     Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in todays music, radios do a good job in editing content in songs, by puting parental advisory on certain cd's, but this still does not stop them from buying the material. In games including, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, @NUM1, etc. teens are now becoming accostumed to this type of behavior, that is not safe nor condusive for children.     By censoring certain material it disallows the continuence of bad behavior amongst our youth today",4,4,4,2
4414,2,"The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times. Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of it's rating or the content in it is inapropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I.      I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultry. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age.      These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them, grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times.      When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON1. This book was a fictional story taking place during the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out.     That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it.      From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over @NUM1, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc.     In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions. The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion.Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imparative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is.",4,4,4,2
4415,2,"Should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think books or any other materials should be taken off the shelves for some people? There are many reasons that the books should stay on the shelves. I am going to tell you all of the reasons I think the books should stay on the shelves.     One reason I think the books should stay on the shelves is because some people might need the books for a school project. For example, a student could have a project over @CAPS1. A book on @CAPS1 could offend many people. Just because it offends some people does not mean it should be taken off the shelf because other people might need that book. Someone might need a certain book for a project. If the one book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone they could fail a class. That is one reason I think the books should stay on the shelves.     Another reason I think they should stay on the shelves it's their opinion if the book offends them. Just because they don't like the book and it offends them doesn't mean other people do not want to read it. Why would you take a book off of a shelf because it offends one or a couple people? There could be many more people who want to check out that book and read it.     If a book offends you just dont look at it. Why would you look at something that offends you? I don't understand why libraries would have to removed a book from the shelf just because it offends someone. Especially, when that person could just ignore the book and pay no attention to it. That is my last reason my opinion is what it is.     So after reading this I hope you understand why my opinion is what it is. There is no point in taking books off the shelves. People need them for research and projects. It is someones opinion if they do not like what the book is about and if it offends them. For example, if i didn't like something on a menu at a resteraunt they are not going to take it off the menu for me. My last reason the books should stay on the shelves is the people can just ignore the books and not look at them that would be easier than taking books off the shelves.                                    THE @CAPS3",4,4,4,2
4417,2,"In our society today there is an enormous amount of exposure to materials that many adults didn't have when they were a child. Young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy portrayed as things a normal child's everyday life consists of. Certain television shows, books, and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many @CAPS1 are opposed to. While libraries @MONTH1 seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age. Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrayes it to be.     One very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at. Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention. While most of the books in a library are age appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading. There are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to. Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the @CAPS1 to not have to worry about what their child has selected. As author Katherine Paterson so rightly said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library.     A second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games. Most video stores have a seperate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them. A minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen. A minor can't rent an @CAPS2-rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them. The same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of @CAPS3, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen. @CAPS5 censorship should be applied to libraries. Having seperate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a seperate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading. @CAPS5 type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it. An example of @CAPS5 would be for a sixteen year old boy. While he cannot go and rent the @CAPS2-rated movie, if his @CAPS1 deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him. @CAPS5 gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. @CAPS5 same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library.     Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children. Many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' @CAPS5 is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take. Allowing our culture to become @CAPS5 way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all to well. Many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink. When it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party. Now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases. There have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking. @CAPS5 ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking. Many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure; but where do the peers get the idea that @CAPS5 is acceptable? These ideas come from the influences that the society's children are susceptable to. Censorship in libraries is one way of restricting the ideas children are exposed to, and hopefully allowing them lead safer and healtheir lives. While there are so many other factors in the exposure to children of these materials, stopping the exposure in libraries is one way of eradicating early exposure. Young children in today's society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate materials.     These three factors, the inability to know what you might be checking out at the library, the fact that video stores already have censorship, and the unecessary exposure to young children, all lead to the need for censorship in libraries. Today's society is all about the freedom to allow anything to happen than is acceptable. While some @MONTH1 see these books or movies as their own freedom to speech the truth is that it is harming the society, hence the need for censorship in libraries and other places where children have access to movies, books, magazines, music, and video games. Removing the offensive books, magazines, and movies from shelves in libraries around the country will lead to a safer culture for children to grow up in, and a society where things such as drugs, alcohol, and sex aren't condoned near as often",5,5,5,3
4419,2,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,     Censorship is an issue that has plagued our society for centuries. It is not only unnecessary, but unconstitutional. As @CAPS1, we have certain @ORGANIZATION1 that we are guarenteed by the documents that keep our society out of anarchy. If the right to pick what liturature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, where will that put our country? Censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today.     In the @CAPS2, the @CAPS3, and the @ORGANIZATION1, we are given certain @ORGANIZATION1. Some of these @ORGANIZATION1, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been contricted, which is 'wrong' in the eyes of the government, but nevertheless, it is taking place. We @MONTH1 not have 'lost' these @ORGANIZATION1, but they have definitely been constricted. Why should the government be able to tell us what to read? If censorship is allowed, what is to come is frightening. If our government, which is supposed to be 'for the people' tells us what we can read and not read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat?     Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues. There are countless examples on why censorship of written liturature should not be allowed. For instance, if a college student is writting a research paper about the effects of rape on a child, but the government sees rape as 'too graphic', what is this student to do? He or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fully-informed paper. But by censoring our libraries, and taking books out, the government is hindering the education of it's countries youth.     Some @CAPS4 classics are also being speculated against. The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2 has been known as a classic since it was written. It is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for education. But recently, the availability of the book has been questioned. Throughout the novel, the 'n-word' is used, but never as an insult. During the time-period of its writing, this word was more common, and had a much less severe meaning than it does in modern day societies. But because time has changed it's meaning, it is being removed from libraries and curriculums across the country. This is unlawful censorship. One of the greatest books of our time, an @CAPS4 classic, is being removed from the lives of our youth because of 'racy language'.     Censorship is not only taking place in written liturature. Movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship. Movies are rated for a reason, to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate. This is helpful to parents to be able to self-censor their children. But it is not up the the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view. It is a parents right to be able to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of our country's lawmakers.     Music is one of the biggest part of our society today. With the invention of iPods and @NUM1 devices, music has become much more common, and portable. Censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style. The music styles of modern teenagers greatly differs from that of their grandparents. Almost nothing is seen as unacceptable by many of today's rappers, as displayed in their choice of lyrics. The music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular. With the most common themes of sex, drugs, and money, it @MONTH1 seem offensive to some citizens, but others @MONTH1 just shrug it off as a normalcy. So how can someone say 'No, you @MONTH1 not listen to that,'? This should not be allowed, yet it is.     How can one person, or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not? They cannot. Censorship is morally wrong, as well as lawfully wrong. Taking the media from its citizens, such as books, movies, and music, is unconstitutional. What would our forefathers think of what censorship has become? Before you pull that 'unacceptable' book off the shelf, remember the @ORGANIZATION1 of our great countries citizens, and the @ORGANIZATION1 of individuals like yourself.                                                                 Sincerely,                                             @PERSON1",5,5,5,3
4425,2,"Katherine Paterson made a valid point in stating that some books are to offensive for some people to read, but that does not mean they they should not be read. Time and time throughout someone's life we hear things that we do not like nor want to be bothered with, but it is good that we do. Libraries should have to right to open all types of books to their shelves and not have them be censored by the public, this is why.      We, as people of the @CAPS1 have battled through hard times. @CAPS2, racistism, and extreme poverty or depression are just a few to recall. Having delt with those issues we alwaying tend to repeat them out of lack of knowledge. Slavery and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were some of the @CAPS1's lowest moments and they were also very gruesome. Recalling those memeries is difficult but something that needs to be done; if books were to be cencored then many young adults would not be educated and could repeat such horrible actions.      Pertaning to movies, music and magzines the same laws applies. Though not in the same way, many times these publications are written about current news or social aspects of life. Music is a form a expression and everyone has their own taste. Not having to opition to chose froma variety of styles is wrong and unfair.  Music can not only be an expression feeling about love or angry but it can also teach life lesson's. Some artist like to sing or rap on their life journey. This can educate others in to knowing that if you do this then this is the result, good or bad. In a magzine they tend to lean towards more current topics such a politics, jobs, or young adults lifestyles. Movies apply to the same rights and topics. Each on is egualily as important and if a group of citizens feel that it is not then who are they to make that call.      What gives a group of people the right to say this is inapporicate and that you should not read it? They do not have it. In the constitution is states that you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it anyway you choose. By censoring what people read that is in a way taking away that author right to speak. Now, that is unfair.      Though Katherine Paterson made a vaild point in saying that some books are to offensive to read, she just simiply is not right. A library is supposed to be a place where people can find a book, music, movie, magazine of any genre  and read it. If matericals were cencored then that is unfair to someone else who does want to read it. Bottom line is that you have free will and you have to power to choose weather or not you want to read something",4,4,4,2
4426,2,"There are things in the world that are not ment for certain people to see. Things like rated @CAPS1 movies, @CAPS2 books, alcohol, and @CAPS2 music are not ment for children.

If a @CAPS4 wants to see a rated @CAPS1 movie or drink a beer that is the parents choice to let that @CAPS4 see that movie not the person running the store. If you are under the age limit a store keeper should have the right to tell you, you can't go in the store or buy his product.           Is it okay for a storkeeper to to tell your @CAPS4 no? Some would say yes to this and others would say no. If your @CAPS4 is trying to buy a movie with guns, blood, and killing, and you don't want your @CAPS4 to have this movie you might be mad if a store keeper let your @CAPS4 buy it. On the other hand you might be mad if this store keeper told your @CAPS4 he wasnt allowed to buy this movie. If the rated @CAPS1 is based on maturaty how does this store keeper know how mature your @CAPS4 really is? Your @CAPS4 could be a one that likes to copy the things they see on movies, the store keeper doesn't know if this is true or not. He doesn't know this @CAPS4, he can't say if he is mature enough to watch this movie with guns, blood, and killing. How would this store keeper feel if this @CAPS4 watched this movie he let the @CAPS4 buy and the @CAPS4 went out and killed someone, how would you feel if this happened? This wouldn't happen if there was an age limit.     If a group of @NUM1 year olds who just got their license go into a liquor store and try to buy beer, who is going to stop them from drinking and driving if there is no age limit on drinking? Lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving. When your @NUM2 years old you don't think about whats going to happen after you make a choice, you just think about how fun it's going to be while your doing it. Most 12-@NUM2 year olds aren't mature enough to make decisions in the spure of the moment.      There for there should be an age limit for some things, maybe not all things in the world, like weather or not your @CAPS4 can buy a candy bar or a soda. But an age limit on buying an @CAPS1 rated movie, alcohol, guns, knives exc. What would the world be like if children went around with these things?

4428,2,"A library card is one thing a kid always looked forward to. It's the first piece of identification that many kids have that they are allowed to carry around themselves.The card opens up a whole new world of entertainment and storys that can take you anywhere you want to go. Once a kid owned a library card, they were allowed to check out any book they wanted out of the huge selection of items in a library. But how do you keep a young child from checking out a book, movie, or magazine about inappropriate adult material? A solution to this problem should be formed so that people can be protected from material they don't want to see in a book, movie, or any other source of entertainment.     Libraries today normally have a specified children's section, where picture books and short stories litter the shelves. The rest of the building is a scattering of books and other materials sorted only by author name and genre. The only way to understand what the item is about is to flip through the pages or read the back cover and try to find a hint of how the plot goes. This could be dangerous at times because not all materials give a specific summary of what happens.      I once rented a movie expecting it to be a scary thriller about a killer in a trailer park. It ended up being scary for another reason, as multiple uncensored sex scenes were displayed throughout the first couple minutes of the feature. I had no idea the movie was going to involve scenes like that and I was disgusted that there was no warning. I believe items like that should be placed in a seperate area or at least be required to give a summary of the kind of offensive material in them. Libraries could collect viewer comments, allowing people who had checked out an item to write what they thought about it. People could then read these comments before checking out that item. Viewer comments would be a good way to get someones else's opinion on what the item contained before another decided to rent it.     Another effective way to help this problem would be to give materials a certain rating, like the ratings of movies when they come out in theaters. A specific rating would warn viewers or readers from checking out an item that is offensive or inappropriate. Libraries could also give specific age ranges according to the ratings on an item, not allowing anyone under a certain age limit to check out a book from the building. Ratings would help keep offensive books out of a child's hands, or that of anyone else who didn't want to be exposed.     Libraries hold all different kinds of materials about any subject you could think of. They can open a whole new world to learn and be entertained but also a world of inappropriate items. I believe items with offensive material should be either put in a seperate area, or given a certain rating in order to warn people before checking it out. Allowing viewers to make comments about the material could also be very helpful. Libraries are a wonderful place full of great stories and adventures, so they should not be polluted with offensive and inappropriate material",4,4,4,2
4435,2,"I don't think that censorship in labraries is right, for many reasons. First reason is that all books and contents that a public library offers to the community should be open to everyone. Second reason is that what you might think is not appropiate, to someone it might not be.  Last reason is that an author has the right to express himself on is book how he feels, without having to worry that his book might be taken off the shelves of public labraries.     My first reason why I think that censorship is not right is that all contents of a library should be open to the community. For example if a student needed to do research on how black slaves were treated back in history,he might not be able to find a book, to find information on it because someone thought books like that are offensive to black people, so in this case this student wouldn't be able to find any information on his topic, because of the censorship in his library, so instead of going to a library he will have to go somewhere else, where he might find the wrong type of information.     Second reason is that what you might think is offensive, might not be to another person. So why should your point of view affect another person.  It wouldn't be fair that a point of view of one person would limit the choices that a person has when he goes to the library. Censorship could take away your favorite series of books of the public library because of group of people thought it was offensive.      My last reason is that an author has the right to express himself on his book how he wants, without having to worry that his book might get taken off the shelves of public libraries for its contents. Sometimes the content that books have is needed to make the book for discriptive, and interisting to the reader. Content that you might think is offensive, is the content that really helps the reader understand the book better.     This are the reasons why i think that censorship is not right. Because if we had censorship on public libraries, then we wouldn't have any books left on the shelves for us to read. So this are my reasons to support my opinion.",4,4,4,2
4437,2,"Libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public. This is important because a child could easily gain access to the offensive material. Censorship is very important for libraries because we do not want our children getting influenced by offensive materials found in their libraries.           The libraries would not even have to get rid of the offensive materials that they took from the shelves. A good idea for them to do is to move all of them to an section for adults so the children will not be able to see them. The libraries would not be losing any money and they would be keeping the youth away from things that are not appropriate for them. Their is no reason to give people access to material that could be offensive to other people.           There are only a few reasons why I think that people should have access to offensive materials. Someone could need to use a book that has something offensive in it, but they would all be taken away to somewhere else. I think that it depends how offensive the materials are, as to whether or not they should be removed from the shelves.      Although I am sort of split on this issue, there are some very good reasons why to move the offensive materials away from the shelves. Those materials are not appropriate for the youth of our country, and they should not have access to them. We should censor the libraries so that nobody gets hurt",3,3,3,1
4442,2,"A few months ago I was at the local library searching for the perfect book. After an hour of searching I decided on one. I was happy with my choice as I checked it out. As I anxiously started reading my book, I found language, drug abuse, and sexual content. As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to any innapropriate material. No one should be exposed to that, and because of that experiance, I believe that censorship in libraries is a must.     Due to sexual content, drug abuse, and vulgar language, one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated-@CAPS1 movie. I believe that since that is true for movies, it should also be true for books, magazines, and music. @CAPS2 literature is not necessary and innapropriate for any age. The world exposes certain literature to children, and then is shocked when they see children in jails, gangs, and other horrible situations.     The world has set their standards too low, and the children of todays society are following after our footsteps. Author, Katherine Paterson once said,     '...if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come.     Everyone has their own opinion and @CAPS2 is mine. As a daily newspaper reader, I could not quiet my voice any longer. I had to step-up and say something. I am apart of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way. The first step to changing that is to set the standards high. Protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to. Situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves. If libraries censor materials, then next time I wnat to find the perfect book, I will.",4,3,4,2
4449,2,"How would you like it if someone took a book away from you, just because it had @CAPS1 language or nasty meaning? I mean of course there are certain books that should be censored, but in doing so you exclude @CAPS1 great novels from the past. These novels were acceptable back then. If you want to censor boks do so in your own library.     Personaly, I don't believe in the censorship of books. It the author meant to write the book that way then the writing should stay that exact way. Censoring destroys books and the learning curriculum of multiple students. You would censor a school book if it had @CAPS1 graphic text between its covers.     There are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas. These books were penned to educate our civilization. If you take away those books, then you will be harming our societies ability to learn. Books, I believe should not be offensive unless your a self-conscious person. Reading a book is a delightful experience, it shouldn't be marred by censorships.      In my personal experience, I have had no problem reading a exquisit novel that has @CAPS1 minor graphic details. I do not care if there is a explicit word in my reading. Albeit, @CAPS1 neive persons have it in there will to remove offensive articles, not for public good, but for personal gain. These offensive tactics are a disgrace to literature and culture. @CAPS1 of the books writen in today's world are far less explicit then before. Thus, we would be creating that unwanted barrier.     When the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 burned the @CAPS4 books, we almost lost a whole civilizations culture and literature. This should never happen to today's literature. If we censor the books in our libraries, then we will be loosing a certain aspect of our culture. The censorship of the articles of reading in our libraries should be kept to personal libraries and only to personal libraries. The libraries are public for a reason.      In conclusion, Censorship should not be placed in libraries because it disrupts the public literature. If the books were meant to be read that way, then so be it. We are not the destroyer of classic literature, and it should never come to that.",4,4,4,2
4452,2,"Should books,music,magazines, etc., be removed form shelves that are found offensive? Everyone has their own oppion on that question. In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable. I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it.      Personaly i don't think anything should be removed from the shelves. While growning up our parents try to keep us from things, at that point in life don't need to see. I can agree with age limit but you can't hide everything. Isn't it best to let the children know whats out there before you just letting them go to find out on there own?     You would probably get multiple answers to that question. My personal views @MONTH1 be different from the person sitting bestide me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and litsen to what you want. The world is not a safe place, its scary and mean to the people. When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certin things that they wont know and wont see. But thats just part of raising your kids, when they get older and start asking quesions i'm going to answer with the truth.     Is keeping these things from our children lying to them? I would have to say yes to that question. By taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong. Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived. Still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself.     To conclude my oppion I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't, not let anyone see it and them and then let them out in the world, and have a complete culture shock. Teach your children whats out there, let them know the truth about the world. Should certain materials be removed from shelves? No, @CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear?",3,4,3,1
4455,2,"Libraries, they are everywhere and all together they contain millions of books that influence everyone who reads them. Whether a book is being read about @PERSON1 or the @CAPS1 there is always something influential to be read. Some books have more adult themes or references to certain subjects which most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages. The question is, is it a good idea for those books that are now being censored to be taken off the shelves? In personal opinion; yes those types of books are influential, yes it is possible that it could negatively effect the youth of @DATE1, but everyone has the right to read what interests them.     Being influential is one of the main priorities of most reading materials. There is a point to be proven or a side story to be shared within most books. Is this a bad thing? Is it 'bad' to explain a point of view or to explain a life experience? No, having experiences is only half the point of living; sharing it is the rest. The @ORGANIZATION1 explains one of the more major downfalls in @LOCATION1 and how it brutally effected the people struggling for life and money. Twilight shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they set their hearts on someone. These are not only experiences but things to ponder upon, and losing these factors in life would be a horrible mistake.     The youth of @DATE1 is portrayed in mostly a negative light. Whether they are considered monsters or maybe even the devils offspring; our youth need influences. Reading is one of the major sources of inspiration for students to grow and prosper. Most students find reading to be boring. In school you are not offered what you want to read. Lists are made, and guidelines are created so that only certain things are read and taught. Young adults need creativity and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds. Taking away the books students and young adults are interested in is one of the many growing problems contributing to people not wanting to read.     Teachers, principals, business men, and even children deserve the right to reading what they like. If you were a sports major and suddenly the population decided sports journals and sports themselves were too harmful and badly influential to people; what would you do when suddenly everything sports related was taken away? You would lose your career. Romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds. Taking away something that is related to something so natural in every day life would have severe reprocussions; especially for those who greatly enjoy those books. Revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed.     Influencing people to think about things that are viewed by everyone is not a bad thing when it can be used to inspire people in their lives. Just because someone is a student or a child doesn't mean that a literary work could rot their mind. Taking away something that can contribute to the every day art of life would slowly create a less creative, inventive, and inspired world. Not everyone believes that certain books are bad, and i, am one of those  thousands of people.",4,4,4,2
4460,2,"I strongly feel that every book was created for people to read and gain knowledge, on what every aspect of what the book is. If your children are looking at things they should not be looking at, you should keep you child away from that section. Every person has a different style of book's that they like to read, they should not have to lose those book's because children are looking at things their not supose to. What would be the point in a library if you can not have certain materials in side it.     My view on censorship in libraries would have to be that those bad sections should be off limits to childeren. All libraries are divided up in to different sections like; fiction, non- fiction, fantasy, children's books. Those sections were created for a reason. If people choose to let their children read books then that is fine with me. Although those parents that do not approve of this can go to a different library. I feel that if that one parent complains and no one else has that they should not be allowed in that library anymore.     I do not beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be excluded  from a library. Just because, a person does not appreciate their child picking up a book they should not have. I feel that parents should be responsiable for what their kid's are looking at, and not make libraries take books off their shelves. Everything from books to movies were put in the libraries for educational reasons. Their should be  laws that say those things are put into a library for a certain reason, and if customers do not like that they can go some where's else.         My own experience being a volunteer at a local library is that there are many things that were put into a libray for a reason. Every movie, book, and magazine have information about something that you @MONTH1 want to know. Books are put in  libraries for people's pleasure and love for reading. All those types of books are made from people that find excitement in reading. Movies at a library are put their for educational reason  like: to teach kids to count, and to learn something about a certain topic. Magazines could just be in a  library for people to read and relax, and learn something new in the world.     I really feel that parent's should watch what their children are reading, you should think the same. Library's should not have to remove books from their shelves that have been there for a really long time. Materials like movies, books, magazines, and music should never be taken away from a library. What would be the point in having a library around if you could not go check a book , movie or cd out that interest's you. After reading this should feel the same, that certain thing should not be removed from a library because parent's do not know how to watch their children",4,4,4,2
4461,2,"Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive? Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently' pick up this book and read it. It could scar them mentally for life.      Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and/or sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents? '@CAPS1, look what I found.' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent. The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book.      However, some @CAPS2 do not find books like that on library shelves offensive. It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life. @CAPS2 are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children. It can and will mentally scar them for life.       The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for @CAPS2 and have the offensive movies/books/magazines, ect in there. Kids can't enter unless they are @NUM1 or older. That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer.      Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up. We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other @CAPS2. The library staff should take action and make a separate room for @CAPS2 @CAPS3",4,4,4,2
4468,2,"Everyone has an opinion. Don't you agree? That's what makes us different, this is why some of us would rather watch @CAPS1 compared to @CAPS2, or why some want to listen to pop instead of country. A library is a place that brings all sorts of people together. It's a place of interest and information, a place for research and enjoyment. So here is my question: 'Do we really want to remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive.'?I don't believe so, as the quote says by the author, Katherine Paterson, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I agree with that statement! Think about this, if we allowed people to get rid of the library books they just don't like, if everyone had that right. We would have no more books, no materials left to study or pleasure read.I have to admit I've seen things that I don't necessarily agree with, but other people might. You can't just have a library all to yourself. Something for just your interests and nobody elses. That's not what a library is for, millions of people use libraries for different purposes. So no I really don't think we should remove items from the shelves. Only pick up what you find interresting and leave it at that. We all have rights just like we all have likes, dislikes, and minds of our own.Opinions define us, choices shape us, but libraries do so much more, they advance our knowledge, make our dreams a reality, and sometimes even broaden our horizons. We need books, music, movies, and even magazines, but we need them all together. That's my position on this topic, I hope this helped form yours.",3,4,3,1
4470,2,"Yes I do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf. You have to think about it from the other person's perspective, or put yourself in their shoes. Say you went to the library and that certain thing was constantly there or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head, that would be a tough problem to deal with in your every day visit to the library. Also  in your everyday life.      One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it affends you then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things. Another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often. I mean if you have to see that book every day dont you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit. So what I am trying to say is I do beleive if there is an offensive book on a shelf remove it.     Music should not be as much of an issue as books. Music is something you listen to or you hear. Books are things you read.     I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books. Books is usally says it right there in black and white. Also the posibality of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture. So what I am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life. So get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive",3,3,3,1
4475,2,I dont think people should remove the books and movies and music cause its the peoples choice to read and listen and watch the things that that get.      Why should people change cause other people can't handle what the stuff has on it. If the people want to read or watch or listen to bad stuff they can its not other peoples choice.     The people will choose what they want or what they think they want to read or watch or listen too. People will find out by themselves what they want to hear or listen too.     Like I said its the people who choose what they want to watch or listen or read and it is nobodies elses choice to say so. The people will find out what they want there kids to read and listen and watch and so will they.     This is what i think of this essay it will be up to the people to choose what they want the listen and hear too.,2,3,2,0
4476,2,"I feel that a person has the right to go to a liberay and get a book, magazine, moive, and whatever else they might because someone could use the material for infomatin they @MONTH1 need. I however do feel that is should be handled maturly, @CAPS1 kept in a special area or somewhere a child or person that should not have material about anything unuseful to them. I think if it is something for an adult only them there sould be no way of a child getting ahold of it.     A person does have a right i feel to go to the libery and get whatever book they @MONTH1 need for personal infomation to help themself to for resherch paper they need infomation on. Anyting inapporatie should have it's own spot away from anyting else.      As i have mentioned I do feel that there should be some protection for childern number one, who do not to be reading about something over there head, and two for someone who doesn't really need that infomation to help  them get infomation about someting.          I think there is many things that can help prevent someone form feeling like the libery need censorship number one would be have a special room just for things that are deemed inapportiate to someone which leads me to my next point there should be a worker just for determing in something should be kept in a specail room. I think there defanilty should be a certian age to enter a room for uncensored materials. If they do not meet the requirments dont let them in. I do think in some cases then they should have to say why they want that certain material just to determine it is for all the right reasons.      As i have menioned I do feel that everyting should be allowed because is could be needed by someone for person infomation, or a classroom prompt that needs infomation. But I also do feel that there should be some rules and requirments as to what is apportiate and what is not. If that person has a legitament reason for needed something i don't see the harm of them getting what they need",3,3,3,1
4477,2,"How would you feel if someone told you that you couldn't have certain food in your fridge that sence its bad for your health or they might think it taste bad. You would not be too happy about it. Well its the same thing when people want to censor the libraries.     When people try to censor the libraries they try to take out books that are 'offensive'. If someone that likes those kind of books and they are being taken off. Its unfair for that person because they are being limited on what they can get from the libaries. Libaries are soppose to be a place where you can get books or magazines that you like to enjoy but they cant do that because people are trying to cencor the books.     The people that want to cencor certain books say that they might offensive not only to them but they could also for the kids. Well I say to that, you don't have to bring your kids to that section. You don't have to read those books you can just leave them alone for the people that like reading them.     To the people that want to cencor certain books what makes a book offencsive? Whos to say if that is offensive or not? The two views are differnt just because one person thinks its offensive doesnt mean another person thinks the same.     My opinion is leave the books there and let people enjoy the books they like to read. No book is bad every book does good for you because it builds your education, it could also be a stress reliever, and something you like to do on your free time. The people that are getting cheated out on the books they like because they are being cencored. What if the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series got cencored because of the magic.To some people that might be an offensive book and if that book was taken off the shelve we would lose one of the greatest books and @CAPS3 of people would be upset.      So the way I see it everyone should be entitled on what books they can choose. To the people that don't like certain books just leave them there you don't like to read them thats fine. Everyone is entitled to there rights like Katherine Paterson said 'You have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for an of us' So we should all get to read what we enjoy to read, cause reading is endless",3,3,3,1
4480,2,"When you have children would you want to shield them from something you think is wrong, even though it goes on in the world around you every single day? Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship.    One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society. We shouldn't be controlled on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to. I have experienced these things almost on a daily basis if it isn't on the radio it's on television. When someones words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or innapropriate.     The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is someone will always have a problem with it. Just recently in one of my own classes we read an article about a very popular chldren's and young adult's film and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it dealt with sorcery. Most of every person I know that has read those books knows that sorcery isn't real. Why do people find it necessary to do things like that? I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different, I find that as unique not bad.      The third thing is no matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films. Just because someone likes something someone else @MONTH1 find vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves. After all the library is public and I put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different.     Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship. Leaving off on a lighter foot, whether it is purple or green, or old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong with it. I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problem is trying to control everything that everyone does",4,4,4,2
4481,2,"Libraries have no right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have the view on censorship the people who rent or buy the items should. The @CAPS1 has an idea of what is offensive but they shouldn't be able to make that decision. If the @CAPS1 wants buisness they should try to make sure the customers are happy. Libraries should take surveys of what everyone wants.     Not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is a offensive book, magazine, movies, music, etc. The different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all. If the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the @CAPS1 and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items. A safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the @CAPS1 or people claim them to be.    Another possible solution would be to jus rearrange the area's of the books into to main category's such as offensive and none offensive, and then break it down into their specific categorys. So the libraries need to have a survey showing what items the people think are bad and the librarys opinions and then go on from there. The surveys could be made up of a paper one you fill out in the @CAPS1 to it's online website. The survey would have a list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off.     Now the @CAPS1 needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary. So if the @CAPS1 feels that a book is offensive they shouldn't have the right to censorship. All these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now. Think about it if it was offensive why did they put it into the @CAPS1 in the first place.     So in conclusion the @CAPS1 should have know right to censorship books, movies, magazines, music, or any other item they have. This would cost time and money which they don't have. Customers could possibly stop comming in because of the change which would be a loss of money. Now everyone knows a big loss of money could hurt any buisness and possibley bankrupt them, or could take weeks, months, or even years to recover and no buisness wants that. So the easy way to make sure that doesn't happen jus leave everything the way it is",3,4,3,1
4485,2,"Have you ever picked up a book, video, or music from the self and wondered why is this here, it's not a well thing for our younger kids to read, watch or listen to. I think that we should pluck out these types of books on our shelf at our libaray to better our community for our kids and their kids. We have all the right to voice our opion on things that we think should and shouldn't be in our libaray. Books that promote sexual activity, killing people, using or taking drugs, and other harmful things, which isn't the best for our kids to read, listen to, or watch should be removed from our libaray shelf.     Have you ever noticed how are crime rate and drug rate has went up in the past few years? These types promotes are in some of our books, videos, and other media. If we remove the videos, books, and other media that promote this kindof behavior we would have less of this type of crimes going on. I don't believe we would have all this crimes going on if we would remove this type of media because we all have a person we want to be like in a song or tv show or even in a book so we follow what they do, if they promote crime you try to act like them. We as humans follow the actions of others weither we think about it or not.     Music also plays a big roll in this to, music containing bad laguage or promoting someone to take drugs or kill people, has been proven to play with our minds. Would you as a parent want to see your kid raised up in a community that promotes sex, drugs, kill people, and other things that we shouldn't do? There's music we all like out there, we listen to what we like so that being, if we like rap for explain, if it promotes killing we are more likely to follow that action in the song because your mind thinks it's self out of it being a crime to kill cause you like rap music so it must be okay.     We @CAPS1's in our community believe that we should abstian our selfs from this kindof behavior and we don't see to many drugs, killings, or sexual activity. The bilbe teaches us to stay away from things that promote drugs, killing, or sexual activiy, thus we don't see much of these behavoirs in a @CAPS2 home or community. @CAPS4 are more better off then lot's of us weither we want to aceppt that or not. They live a life after @CAPS3, which don't promote all these behavoirs. and I know that @CAPS4 would be more willing to take out these type of media in our libaray. You can sit for one whole day and watch the actions of @CAPS4 and how they act they don't act like normal people as far as into drugs and stuff like that, only because they abstain their selfs from media that promotes sex, killing, and drugs.     Now, if you want to help us make our community a better place for your kids and their kids, let's remove the harmful media in our libaray that promotes sex, drugs, and killing. I don't think you would want to see your kid doing drugs or killing people and messing up their lifes because you didn't help in removing this media. Please help us better our community for our kids and their kids and the genrations to come after us.",3,4,3,1
4486,2,"Should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries? No I do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries. A librarie should have lots of different kinds of books, magazines, music, and movies.     One reason I think that a librarie should have all sorts of different books is because everybody doesn't like to read the same thing. Like for example some kids could love to read scary and gory books and others could like to read books about sports or love stories. So maybe the kids that read sport books could be offended by all the gory books, but that wouldn't be fair to take them out of the librarie because some kids like to read gory books.     Another reason they shouldn't remove any magazines, books, etc, is because it is nice to get to read or look at different things. People would get bored if their librarie only had books about war. Kids need to learn how to read different kinds of stories. Also if your librarie has all different kinds of magazines kids could learn a lot of interesting facts. You can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine. So if you only had four magazines about the same thing kids wouldn't discover anymore cool facts.     A librarie is a place where kids like to go and enjoy some peace and quiet and look and read different things. So I think if you started taking specific things out of the librarie then I think kids would stop coming to the librarie. A librarie contains awsome infromation that kids could learn, but if you start taking things out then not that many kids will come to the librarie because they will not be learning @CAPS1 new.     So if I had any say in this I would keep all things in the librarie. I would not remove @CAPS1! You want people to come to your librarie so you dont want to do @CAPS1 that can jeperdize people coming to your librarie. I think if you start removing things then your going to have less and less people come in and eventually maybe your librarie will get shut down because you have no buisness. So leave everything on the shelves.",4,4,4,2
4488,2,"I think that movies, and magazines should be censured to kids at the library. There are many reasons these things should be censured and in this paper I am going to explain why they should be censured. I am also going to give a few examples of some stuff that shouldn't be possible for kids to get.      The main reason movies should be censured is because movies that are rated @CAPS1 are not only supposed to be rented by children but it wrong to rent these movies to them. I mean if there is a sex scene or something and your only like eight years old this would be awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing. I mean if you were a parent would you want to explain to your eight year what sex is.      The next thing that I think should be censured at the library is magazines. I know three in perticular off the top of my head, and they are @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @ORGANIZATION1. These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed. I really don't any kid, teenagers included should need to know how to be better in bed. They also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try. This could cause them to get very sick and if they're already skinny, they could possibly die.      Well this pretty much sums up what I think about library contents being censured. I don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids ears and eyes. I mean there are romances but I don't think any kid is going to last thru a whole romance, because they are pretty boring. Well I hope this will prevent libraries from letting kids get ahold of this kind of content",3,3,3,1
4489,2,"In libraries there are some books,music,magaizines that are not very apporiate to put on shelves. There are little kids that will want to look at anything they can get their hands on. They are very mysterious when it comes to that.      There are bad books but there are also good books in the library. If people found a book or any type of material in the library and found it offensive, then they should take it off the shelf. There are children that look at anything they want or what they think looks interesting. The library also should at least check what the book is about when it arrives at the library. That way no one would have to worry about a material being offensive. Movies should not matter really because there are a lot of bad movies but i dont think that people would find them offensive. They dont have to watch it and neither do their children.      There is a lot of bad music. I think there should be censorship on music because some music today is about drugs,alchoal, and violance. People would not want to see that in their local library for their children to see. I have seen on the news people get upset when they see something that they think is inappropiate for underage children. I would get mad too because i dont want an underage child to be listening to that type of music. Children now look up to these song writers and want to become them. That is not a good thing at all.      All magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is. Libraries would not put a inappropiate magazine on the shelves. There are some magazines that they have but they are good magazines even for children to read. I think that the libraries dont put offensive magazines out because they dont want any controversy. People today have came out even more good magazines for anyone to read that is not inappropaite for anyone.      I think some people today dont realize that the library would want to offend anyone by putting those offensive magaizines,movies,books and music. Putting censorship on those things would be a good thing because there are materials that are not good for small children to read or hear or watch. The parents dont want their children looking up to a person who is involved in violence or drugs or alchoal. Censorship would be they way to go on all those materials just to keep away contoversy and the children safe.",4,4,4,2
4490,2,"Censorship can be considered as a major problem.  I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch.  Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend.  Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong.     First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone.  I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today.  So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral.     Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored.  My opinion @MONTH1 differ from another person's and their opinion @MONTH1 be way different from someone elses.  If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves.  Others @MONTH1 find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting.     Lastly, censorship is a communist trend.  Last I checked, the @LOCATION1 is a democracy.  So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race.     So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere.  It is a very communist thing to do.  It infringes our rights.  Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored",3,3,3,1
4493,2,"'@CAPS1 day @CAPS4 @CAPS3, my dad was pulled over three times for @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5.' @CAPS6 is just @CAPS1 of several quotes from a book that I am reading that some people could take offense to. The book in general is a rather appeasing book, it's just some things, people might take offense to. That doesn't mean the book shouldn't belong on shelves.     I don't think that libraries should be forced to take books off shelves just because they offended someone. That's like saying you should shoot everyone who has made an offensive comment to somebody in their life, you would be left with nothing in the end. If someone finds the things that other people have to say, offensive, they generally stop hanging out with that person. Therefore, it would only make sense for someone to stop reading a book if they find it offensive.     Some magazines have really offensive things in them, that people in the real world say. It's not like your generic non-fiction books that come up with insulting things to say, at a high school level. You don't have to subscirbe to that particular magazine, or even pick it up to read. These days, so many things offend so many people, in so many different ways. What might offend @PERSON1 down the street, @PERSON2 across town might find funny.You cannot make everyone happy, and if you took books off the shlef because someone complained about the offensive things that they read, you would be trying to appease to everyones' wants and needs.     I think it would be fair to put a restriction on books, about age limits. Some of the more offensive ones could have the higher age limits. At the junior high I attended, they have books categorized as 'young adult' books, which means you either have to be in eighth grade or have a note from your guardian saying that it's alright for you to read those types of books. It'd be just like movies; movies have the ratings so that only certain people can watch them, why can't they do the same with books?     I guess what I am trying to say is that it would be very disappointing to me and numerous other people if you just started taking books, @CAPS7, movies, magazines, and so on, off the shelves, and out of market just because someone cried foul against it. If they don't like the material that they are looking at, reading, watching, listening to, or all the above, no @CAPS1 is forcing them to pay attention to it. They can go read the nursery rhymes, because those are not offenesive. Once again I say, taking a book off the shelf everytime someone complains about the material would be like shooting every person who has ever made an offensive comment to someone in their lifetime, you'd be left with nothing.",4,4,4,2
4495,2,"In my opinion, censorship of any kind shouldn't exist, especially in libraries.           Libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book, @CAPS1, magazine, or movie. It's where the poor can have access to the same materials the better off have. If you take away opinions in books, music, film or magazine/newspaper articles, then you're taking away the author's right to freedom of speech just because someone deemed it offensive.           The right to free speech is an important one in the @LOCATION1, we can have opinions here, we can choose our beliefs, and if someone wants to share their beliefs and opinions by form of writing, then they should be allowed.          Writing is a form of expression, writers can express their thoughts, use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters. Who does one think they are to say it's offensive? Who gets to decide that this book of movie is offensive?          If we take away books that one person finds 'offensive', we wouldn't have anything to read. Some people @MONTH1 find the @CAPS2 offensive, but we still put that in libraries, some people @MONTH1 find books on wizardry and vampires offensive, yet those are all rage now, we wouldn't take those away.     Things that people find offensive are just opinions--just like the ones of those of the writers. It just simply wouldn't work out--if you want young people to read, you have to give them something to read that will stimulate their interests, and sometimes that @MONTH1 be 'offensive.",4,4,4,2
4499,2,"I was asked the question 'Do you believe that a certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazine, etc.? should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensice?' I would have to say no. I dont think you should be in the library to be critisizing what other people believe in. But what if you just come past a book, movie, music, or magizine that is offensive? Just ignore it.      I dont think people have enough time to be caring what other people think, even though people do it all the time. Next time you see a book that is offensive to you just walk away from it and dont bother looking at it. Everything can be offensive to anyone, @PERSON2 was completly right when she had said '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...The you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think this day and age everykid knows more than they're supposed to anyways, so why cencor what they already know? What if you might like this specific series and it is about the haulacaust and it is like many different story made into one to tell about how the @CAPS1 stayed in the camps, but your not @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, and a @CAPS2 happens to read it and get it taken off the shelfs cause it's offensive. Maybe he thought it was a disgrace and lies about his home country and it's making people think they're all like the @CAPS5.If theat had happened to you what would you do? Would you go looking for a new book? Or would you be upset cause you weren't able to finish the whole series? Many people things offensive every single day, when they shouldn't.      People try to act like they're better than everyone else, and it's not right. If your one to take things in books, movies, music, or magazines offensive then you need to get over yourself and realize that you need to spend more time on living life rather than get upset cause of stupid pitty stuff. In music they're are certain words used that one might like to be called, but if a differnt race decided to sing about it too then he might get upset and think that he's being rasict. It's not being rasict, offenending, or directed towards you! So, just do everyone a favor and stop complaining. Now Katherine Paterson, @CAPS6 if you have a problem with your child or any other children taking a book off a shelf even though it might offend some I think you need to realize that it is a good thing that, that child is still trying to read, and trying to get better at reading by reading. There are selected magazines and movies out there on shelfs of publi libraries and stores that might be offending others, but if it is offending you why are you looking or even gonna buy/check it out?     I personally dont think any books should be taken off the shelf of any library anywhere. taking books off shelves are like telling people to stop reading",4,4,4,2
4501,2,"When someone goes to the library, there is multiple items to choose from.  There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc.  But not all of this is nessessarilly a good thing.  There are several books, movies, and music albums that can be either offensive or not right for a library's audience.  The material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for children sake.     Although there is much good items in a library, there is also bad or offensive items in a library as well.  For example, an explicit music album.  If an explicit music album is just sitting on the shelf of a library, then any person could listen to it or take it out for awhile.  By taking out the bad music, that keeps younger kids away from the explicit music that most parents don't want there children listening to anyway.  Movies are also a problem in library's.  For example, library's having @CAPS1 rated movies on the shelves for anyone to take out to go watch.  Most @CAPS1 rated movies have something in them that doesn't make them child appropriate.  Movies that are @CAPS1 rated are rated that because of all the material in the movie.  This is why when these movies are played on television, they are edited so all audiences can watch.  So by taking these types of movies off the shelves in library's, it keeps young children away from inappropriate behavior.  Books are the same way as movies and music.  There are books on the shelves that some people concider 'funny', but in all reality, it's a harmful book.  There are books made that include racial material in them, even deragator statements.  By taking these types of books off the shelves of library's, a lot more people wouldn't be introduced to all the racial comments that occur.      For the sake of the children and young kids, any material that is found offensive in library's should be removed.  If library's would just remove all the bad materials, it'll make all library's a more healthy and stable enviornment for studying like it used to be used for.  Take out all the offensvie material, then they could put more educational books, movies, etc.",4,4,4,2
4505,2,"Hey my name is @PERSON1 and I have some things to talk about that people need to hear. I think that libraries are a good thing for people of all ages but, there are some books in the library that are not made for children to read or evan see. They should at least put them in a seprate part of the library.     I had an experince like this once. I was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me. I didnt want to take him but I couldnt say no to him. He got his shoes on and he ran to the door, he was so excited. We pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors. I chased after him, when I caught him I told him that he couldnt run away from me like that. We went inside, it was a giant library. He went to find a book to look at and I went to find a good book to read. I found one that looked very interesting I got it and started to read it. Then @CAPS1 ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go see the book. He handed it to me and I just lost it, the book was not a children book at all. I was one of the worst book that I have ever seen, we left the library and never came back.      I think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library. This section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there. This is what I think sould be done to all libraries",3,3,3,1

I belive that the some stuff can change out of the world. not from people's offense or not because there will be none left too sell if people had there points of being offensive because everything is offensive to at less one person would be offensive.     I think they need to get rid of things that causes the weak minded people will do if they see it and have it in there mind and go do it in real life getting rid of the things that can get the weak mind in trouble.     I think that every that we can change what we see or hear and change the world, and thats what the world needs to change on what we could not think of before.",3,2,3,1
4510,2,"I think that censorship should be allowed in high school. For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are censorship can learn a lot from it.Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropiate at school then why are they here? Movies that are not allowed becasue of its rating I think is lame because it might have pictures of naked people and bad language but we are high school students and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are mature enough to watch.Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a good and bad thing but overally I think it should be allowed.     Therefore, books or movies that are censored, shouldn't be because I personally think that students learn better from recent rated r movies then some @DATE1 movied thats in black and white. Kids pay more attention to good interesting movies and the old movies most student fall asleep or just doesn't pay attention at all. So after that, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     If books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already. I think its foolish for teachers or administraters to think that we are to immature to watch rated r movies like every kid at school watches them at home,I believe. Yeah I know some movies show some scenes that arn't school related but who cares we will get over it. Overall I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     Well then last point is that all these helps us in a way if you really think about it. Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week dont let them listen to anything than see which comes out better. Personally listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on coarse to get my work done.SO therefore, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     So you got my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer. I think rated r movies should be allowed at high schools and any music should to i mean its not like we are in prison,right? So there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools",4,4,4,2
4512,2,"Today, millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage. This can range from exposure to certain movies, music, magazines, books, or to even commercials. Parents, teachers, and even governments censor materials such as these to protect the students or the general population on topics that can be offensive or difficult to explain. However is that really the right choice?      In life, we cannot shut our eyes and pretend that there are not harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face. In fact, our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equiped when we go off on our own to find our place in the world. This then begs the question is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students? When one conceals information, that person is stealing the right of knowledge. Not only that, but what one person finds offensive another can @MONTH1 not. This topic is just too abstract to be regulated. For example, take what Katherine Paterson said about how if everyone decided to work in this manner, all the books in the world wouldn't be available to any of us.      Therefore censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in",4,3,4,2
4514,2,"Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?      First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone.  Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another?      Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.      As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as'some might take offensive' or 'material @MONTH1 be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning. It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.     In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves",4,4,4,2
4518,2,"libraries arcross the world contain all kinds of books, so good and some bad. theres always gonna be something in a book that @MONTH1 offend the reader or someone close to the reader. it just depends how sensitive people are. the main reason people want to ban books or have them removed from libraries is because of racial slurs, relgion, and sexual content.       i think it should be the libraries choice to either put the book on the shelf or to take it down. magazines are an issue along with movies and different kinds of music. according to some libraries are just trashed with vulgar, racial, or bad movies, books, ect. if the parents are scared of there children being able to rent these things, they need to put some sort of block on them. if you want to rent bad things you should have to have parental permition.      taking all of these things out of the library is not a soulution. all it does is create anger and leads to lawsuits and more. the library needs to make sections of different rated books so that kids wont be able to get the 'bad' books in there hands.alot of the nooks in libraries have meaning even if the book uses foul language or hate etc. it shows the mood of the story or how the charachter really feels inside. if stories like '@CAPS1 in The @CAPS2' didnt have anger, emotion, or the passion it has it would be a boring book. authors put language, sexual content, and violence in books, movies, and magazines to entertain certain crowds. if you take these things away certain people will not have the entertainment they have enjoyed with the things they have read or things could possibly read",3,3,3,1
4519,2,"@CAPS1          @CAPS1 a day where there are no books in the school library. A librarian walks through the now empty corridors, reminising of the days before censoring, before everyone told her of what they found offensive. Everyones ideas are different, but that absolutely does not mean they should have everyone else comply.      Saying such, if someone finds a book offensive, they just should not pick it up. Just don't read it! By pushing to have the book taken out, they would be implying that they know best, and usually, they don't know best. A @CAPS2 could be offended by a fashion magizine in the library @LOCATION1 simply has an advertiziment for a body wash. She @MONTH1 say something like '@CAPS3 child shouldn't see things like this,' then demand it be taken out of the library.      Does that make sense? I didn't think so either. In addition, if one woman was able to take a magazine out of the library, then another man or woman would believe they had the same power. Censoring could become a casual thing, and books could be thrown out daily! Now, that's only on a small scale. @CAPS1 if they actually took this up with higher authorities. That book would be taken away from all schools in the @LOCATION1 brings us to this problem. Should we, as people,as normal citizens, really decide what others are able to read? The answer to that is a definate no.      Let's look on the other end of this now, too. What will happen to the authors who wrote the books that are now banned? As an example, I'll use @PERSON1. What would happen to her if the series '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' were banned from schools? Also, what about the kids that like to read? This is just taking good books away from the students...Because someone didn't believe in magic and threw a fit about it.      That librarian from the beginning is leaving now, theres no more books to check out, bring back, or read anymore. The kids have to go to a public library to get all the books they want to read, and are then still discouraged from reading because the material wasn't proper. This shouldn't happen. Books do not need to be censored, and people who have a problem with a book just shouldn't ruin it for everybody",3,4,3,1

Say i wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting, i would still be able to write it and sell it. anything that anyone has a problem with they try to band or get rid of it. instead why dont they just get over it? we have rights every individual person from me to you we all have them, and should be able to use them to the full exstent of what they can be used for.

Like author Katherine Paterson said if we start taking book off the shelvies then there willn't be any books left to read. Yes, there are books out there that are not ment for little kids and some adults, but that's why you dont let them cheak them out till you think they are old enough. Just because you dont like the book doesn't mean noone else likes it. Everyone has there own tast in reading, as everything else.     Libraries have sections for all ages. With books for there age. Like the childern's section is for little kid, and the adult section is for adults. Little kids shouldn't be cheaking out books from the adult section. Parents should take responsibility over there kids and watch what they'r doing. Then we wouldn't have to worrie about what they are reading, watching, or listening to.     The libraries are doing just fine the way they are, and have been for years, and will for years to come. So no libraries shuold have to take sertain books off the shelves just because someone doesn't like it, or want there kid reading it. Just ignore that the book is even there and find another one that fits you'r liking. People learn alot from books, so if we get rid of most of them what will we lear from then?

Or another question is, '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' @CAPS2 are very commonly asked questions, and should have attention put toward them.     In my oponion, books should have a age limit on them. My reasoning is becuase, kids under @NUM1 years of age should have a place where they can find good books for thier age group. There are plently of books out there for all age groups. A kid under @NUM1, should not be able to check out a book, magazine, movie, or music that has offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behivor from the character, or artist.      Another reason @CAPS1 libraries should have a age limit on things you can check out, is becuase kids can get the wrong idea. Lets say, a book has a statment in it that says '@CAPS3, I went to my bestfreind's house and drank alcohol.' @CAPS4 would be somthing that a child should not able able to read. It would give the child the wrong idea in what they 'could' be doing.

There are many different reasons for reading a book and if you want to read a book for enjoyment and you end up reading one that you find offensive, then choose a different topic to read about because some people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic. Just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic the book covers does not give anyone the right to take the book off of the shelf because they feel that it is sending a bad message to younger kids or might be offending to some people. If people do not want their kids reading about that topic then tell them when they go to check a book out at the library not to get a book over that topic.      If it becomes too big of a deal to where people begin to find a lot of books that offend them or other people, then suggest for the library to have a list of the books and their topics. Each library could be required to have a list of books, and have the suggested age of the readers beside it, or there could be different sections of the library. One section for kids, one section for teenagers, one section for adults, and one section for middle aged people. Also, if it absolutely needs to happen, each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about. This will give you an idea of what the book is about before you read it so if there is a certain topic that offends you then you can go ahead and find another book and find out what that one is about. This would help many people not read books that offend them and it would help them find a book that is more suitable for what they want to read about.      Songs are a whole other subject. An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing songs about what they want. If people find the profanity in the song offensive, then do not listen to it. There is no way that you can tell a song writer not to sing or rap about what they want, and stores are going to sell albums that give them business. If people do not want their kids around that kind of language or message that the song is giving off then they can just tell their kids not to listen to it, because artists are going to write songs, rap songs, and sing songs about what is going to make them money, and that is just a fact.",4,4,4,2
4536,2,"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:          Censorship, does @CAPS2 deserve a place in our society?      There has been much contreversy over this topic. Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, over the same topic, believe the complete opposite. They believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity, which is where i stand on the situation.     @CAPS2 seems as though everytime we cross over this bridge, @CAPS2 comes right back in front of us. Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must preform proper edicate and have everyone act nothing less of the same, unfortunately for many, the people that are like this, usually, have much power in the say of what comes and what goes, not allowing many of us lower graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things.      My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too. However, I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all. There is one, count that, one situation where I feel censorship is necessary. One is songs that go on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but '*bleep* this, and *bleep that'.      All other material, whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing, is acceptable. There's just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words, to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with @CAPS2. Great @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @CAPS2 be about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear '*bleep*' when @CAPS2 is on the radio. By just that '*bleep*', you can lose the message thats coming across.      Also, ever hear the phrase, 'equal rights'? Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right? @CAPS2's just like talking but with either pages or instruments. And that's how I will leave you on this debateable topic. I hope I might have changed some opinions of you today, if not then your loss. Thank you for your time.                                                                                                     A @CAPS6 to the @CAPS7,                                                     @LOCATION1",3,3,3,1
4537,2,"Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library?  Several people would agree, but I disagree.          Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some @MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of there freedom.           You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track.          Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.           Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set. It would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether. Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media",4,4,4,2
4538,2,"Do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over @CAPS1? Do you think that children can control themselves with offensive behavor? Have you ever seen a child watch a scary movie that was @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Why do you think that most parents block that kind of viewings from their young children? I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children, if they are found offensive.       I fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading. I think they should consider the effects that come with watching or reading certain things. Children at young ages still have their innocence. You don't want your child having nightmares because you let them watch a over @CAPS1 rating movie. You would feel guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life.      You have to make a choice on whether the it's comfortable for them to view what their watching or reading! It's important to hid them so the child can not get ahold to them. Be wise of the kind of movies and books you leave around the library. You should have a section for children in libraries. You should have all the materials that a child should be interested in. It should be colorful and playful as possible.      I used to watch this girl named @CAPS5. I was babysitting her one night, while her parents were at the movies. I brung a movie to watch, when @CAPS5 fell asleep. So once the clock turned to @NUM1, I put her to sleep. But little did I know she woke up and @ORGANIZATION1 me watching this horror film called @ORGANIZATION1. It gushed blood everywhere and she started to sceam! I thought I had secured her in her bedroom, to go to sleep but to my surprise she was still woke! I rushed over to her and put her back to sleep. hoping she didn't have any nightmares.     Please be curtious to the things youlet children read or see. You have to think of the effects of what's going to happen to the child later in life. I know you think that it's not that harmful to children, but it can really mess up their minds and actions forever. So I hope I have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over @CAPS1 movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children",4,4,4,2
4542,2,"Many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. So should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? I believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what.     I know that a certain case, specific to me, is that my mother did not like me reading a specific series becasue she thought that it was not an appropriate reading material for me. Because of that, that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author. She respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read.     In many libraries, I know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults. Within those specific designated areas, they have kind of 'sub-area' where they seperate educational from entertainment and so on. Let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely? I do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children.     I do believe that libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is aloud to look at them and be able to check them out. An eight year old should not be able to go in and get a @NUM1 movie whenever they want to. There should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the @NUM1 movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment.    Libraries to respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible. They will have children's videos seperate from the adult videos and they even have a whole seperate section of books for them to discover and journey into. The only thing that I believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. A library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentily stumble upon any raunchy article.     So, should libraries completely remove areas of media? I do not think so. I think that they should distinguish from adult's and children's materials. Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf . . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read.",4,4,4,2
4548,2,"No,I dont think that certain books,music,movies,maganzines should be taken off the shefls.If stuff like that gets taken off then there will be nothing good to read the book now day a starting to get good so if they take the good book then no one will read.Most people think that rap music is bad but that is the music that most people listen to now day and mosy people dont like country.There are some bad movies out there but they are fun to watch becaues there ether funn,gross,or they are sad but there bad movies are groess or funn.       If people made better magazines then they wouldnt have that much money then that buissness will go out of buissness and that not a good thing because the  person that runns the buissness will have no money to feed his kids.Sence i have been alive nost of the good thing like books,music,magazines have changed because people dont like the stuff from a long time ago. If they do it again then people will  stop going to the movies and buying books so that wht i think.     Now there are alot of good movies and music coming out so if they brought back all the stuff they use to have then people would have more money.Why people would have more money is because more people would go se the movies from back in the old days.So like movie like from @NUM1 and even @NUM2 would make a lot mof monoey.     So that why i think they should not take stuff off because that is how we are loseing all hour money.The people are useing the that they would for movies or books and stuff they are useing for drugs and other stuff that can get them sent to jail and stuff",2,2,2,0
4550,2,"Alot of things can be found offensive now days, but that does not mean you take it away from others who enjoy it. Everyone has their own view, and opinon on things. For the things people find offensive I believe they should just simply stay away from it.     No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves. Somethings people @MONTH1 find offensive others might enjoy. Its simple, if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries. Yes, there @MONTH1 be alot of things that people take offensive, but that dose not mean take away the things others @MONTH1 enjoy. I have been to many libraries in my life. I have not really seen anything offensive, but I have seen some books and movies for adults only. Honestly in my eyes its simple, if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it, because others @MONTH1 enjoy it.     Its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves. Although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it. You have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions.",3,3,3,1
4554,2,"In @LOCATION1, everyone wants censorship. Mainly because they dont want be the outcast. Thats understandable in the case that we have numerous amount of different races in @LOCATION1. In some ways, censorship is necessary and in other ways, some people just want attention. If all different races want censorship, then why would we censor to the liking of just one group of people?     Essentially, the censorship problem won't go away because it is a chain reaction. For example, if a group of people asked a library to get rid of books because of the references they make, that might be insulting to another group of people. then that group of people wouoldn't like a reference to another book, which another group of people dislike, and it goes on and on. So for the censorship towards different groups of people, there will have to be some tolerance.      On the other hand, young children are in need of censorship. They grow and mature everyday, developing physically and mentally. So if we were to put an inapropriate book in front of them, they would read it and accept is as standard. And when they read bad things like that, they develop the wrong goals and values for their future lives.      We are all different, and interpret things in different ways. So when you watch a movie to listen to music and think it wrong, someone right around the corner @MONTH1 think that its just normal. If you question someones movie or song, in the scheme of things, your questioning their judgement, and thats unfair to them",4,4,4,2
4560,2,I do not really read books. I think that offensive things sould be tooken off shelves because there could be a sene if they are'nt. There are many people who will fight if they are truely offended and it is not a pretty sight.,2,2,2,0
4564,2,"Everyone has there own opinions and arguements about something. There are a lot of books that can be offensive to people in some ways. There can be over thousands of books in a library, and I find it difficult sometimes to find that right book that interests me. My personal opinion is that i do not think that books should be removed from a shelf even though it @MONTH1 offend someone.     As I stated in the first paragraph, everyone has there own opinions. There are so many types of books out there from murderes, romance, mysteries, drugs, and many more. These books should be placed in seperate areas just as many books are. If books are taken off a shelf what does that mean to us people? Everyone has there own freedom. So if books are going to be moved from someone that's taking away from are individual freedom.      There are more to books in a libray also. From books, movies, music, magazine, etc., can all of the have different types to them. I do think they should just be placed in different areas. I can see where people think that this can cause an influence to young children if they pick up something that is disturbing, but they should be with an adult. Adults know what is right from wrong than what children do. For example, whenever i walk into public places i hardly every see children just running around especially in libraries. Libraries are expected to be kept quiet and not out jumping around and screaming. The kids should be kept with there parent or an adult that way they can't grab something they shouldn't.     I understand that some teenagers can be offended to drugs or killings, in magazines or books, but some people like reading about that kind of stuff. Does that mean we have the right to take it off the shelf because one is offended? To many think they have the right to do anything without negociating with others. People that do not like that kind of stuff should just put it back down and go on with what they were doing.I can understand if you think that restrictions should be put on some things because i will agree. There should be sections for teens, adults, and children. To me that does not mean we have to remove anything though from otheres for offending someone.                 Libraries can have an affect on your everyday life because of how calming and soothing it can be. You should be able to have freedom without removing anything from anyone. Taking away things does not mean your just taking away from one, it means your taking away from everyone. You can have your own censorship in libraries from your individual freedom. These are my personal views on why things should not be removed from shelves or anything else",3,3,3,1
4567,2,"Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on @CAPS1 shelves.  They claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read.  These books are known as '@CAPS2 Books.'  @CAPS3, librarians, and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not.     In the novel To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive.  These words, however, are essential to the setting of the novel.  The author is not claiming that she personally feels that @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be described in the way that they are, but a racist individual, such as @PERSON3 or many people during the time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a way.  The novel, To @CAPS4 a @CAPS9, is a great way for people to understand the history of the @CAPS10.  Without the descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would unknown to many.     The novel, @PERSON4 in the @CAPS11, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiney, teenager.  The author, @PERSON2, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters.  The charachters, however, are high school boys that live at a boarding school.  To water down the language or to make the novel 'kid friendly' would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters.  The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations.  These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of plot as well as the changing charachter traits of the protagonist, @PERSON1.     Literature is not the only medium being targetted by those trying to completely censor libraries.  Music, movies, magazines, and videogames are being targeted as well.  In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them.  It should be remembered that it is the @CAPS3 responsibility to censor materials for their children.  Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a diurnal occurence.  @CAPS1 patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences.     In conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. Librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries.  Libraries should present a wide variety of books, movies, etc. to the public.  If libraries do this, it becomes the responsiblity of either the @CAPS3 or the individual to pick out books that are within personal boundaries",5,5,5,3
4568,2,"Works of literature are works of literature no matter what they contain.All liteature should be placed on the shelves of a library. If for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter. Literature is a strong item when it comes to persuasion. So we must take care of what we allow to be released or seen and to which eyes.     Literature is written by the author for many reasons. Perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a point of view but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read. How would the author ever achieve his or her goal if we decided to remove their hard work from the library shelves. It simply could not be read if it is not available. This is one reason why certain books should not be altogether removed from the library.     No matter how crude a topic @MONTH1 be it @MONTH1 still be needed by certain individuals. If there were images of a nude person in a scientific book that librarians did not want children to get their hands on then how would students study a topic such as sexual education or anatomy for a class? Of course there are people who simply want to see nudity for foolish pleasure and that is why permission should berequired to obtain these books. A small closed off room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed crude. This way the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian.     A book not read @MONTH1 as well never have been written. There is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some @MONTH1 feel offended. The simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them. We simply can not lose certain pieces of writing because some parents do not trust their childs eye or because a person @MONTH1 be offended at the material. After all, when everybody has a chance to say what is offensive there will be no books left.",4,4,4,2
4570,2,"Taking books off the shelves will not change anything children are just goin to @CAPS1 to a different place to find the book, @CAPS1 to a book store or Other librabies if they like it. If I seen a book and I knew I wasnt suppose to read but then I knew it was  good music, book, or magazie. I would get it cause thats what children do explore. books are here to read and to look at i feel if you know im not suppose to read it make me show prof of age or not give it to me.          Really dont understand why sum books be in stores and people dont want u reading them. Sum children dont read at all and to see them to pick up a book, @CAPS2 down to read should be good eoungh. But there is always a age group thats not suppose to read some books. But at the smae time you cant keep the child away from the world, and what it brings you. The book are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past.          I feel like the reason why children listen to music is that some time the track relate to them in a way that a other person would not understand. So they feel the song other thren what another person would hear just the @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6. Thats not what sum parents want you to hear.     Magazines tells alot of things and show to much for the younger minds. Im a father my self and would want my son at the age of @NUM1 looking at any naked girl or adds about pron in @ORGANIZATION1 books or any of that kind. parents can sometimes be over hard on a child and not let them do a lot of things. But they feel that they knows whats best for u. What ever  they tell you is not wrong cause the @MONTH1 have been through it already. That would only lead to them doing things behide there backs.

4573,2,"I strongly disagree with the idea of removing any materials from public shelfs. Books,magazines, and the rest of the materials are based on the author's and musician's experiences and their observations. With the population of readers in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I no that the removal of books for what they might contain would have a bad impact on the people as a hole. The world needs its materials.     The writer of the book writes on his Observations and his own personal experiences in life. The @CAPS3 put so much into it why take it away cause someone doesn't like how part of it's worded. Movies that are considered bad probably just have a bad word or a scene where theres a little blood. Lots of people like to make a big deal out of nothing. I seriously think some parents think if their kid here a bad work or sees a little podle of blood that the kid is going to end up in jail.     Then there is music. The public thinks that kids should not be exposed to music like rap and hip-hop. I agree with that, but I also don't see if its christain rap or its a clean song whats wrong with it. A musician is not just payed for his or her amazing skills with an instrument, but also with his or her way to connect with the listener.     I truely don't see any reason for take any form of materials off the shelfs. The artist who produces it has a right to their own oppion. The public I feel makes a big deal out of nothing. The smallest problems don't name the material the way the reader hears the work of the artist",3,3,3,1
4575,2,"Censorship is a two sided question. There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offinisve should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some reasons that can be thought about be for deciding if censoship is right or not.     What is too offinsive for a student to read? In history many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past. If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound it repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities.     If books are censored than that takes away a persons right to freedom of speech. That restricts somes creativity and since of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now @MONTH1 have never have been read. Books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world.     People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future. Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, bacuse someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn. The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past. Having books that are said to be offinsive can help in @MONTH1 ways.     All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about than they don't  have to read the book. A lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come.",4,4,4,2
4577,2,"There are many things out in the 'material' world that people take offense to. No matter what, there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is, whether it be a book or a song or a movie. But they do not have any idea what they are doing when they bring up their 'rights'. If they get to say that they are offended by the certain media product, not only do they announce that they have the right to try to have it banned, but they are giving the people who do not find offense in the material to dish out the same. If they can pull something off the shelves that they 'find offense to', then everyone @CAPS4 a right to. Another thing is that they claim to find offense to the song or book or movie, but if it bothers them that bad, they should just not listen/read/watch what @CAPS5 it is that they are feeling offends them. It would be that simple, just switch radio stations, or pick up another book, or watch a different movie. Another thing that the 'offended' people can try is having an open mind. It would make everything far less dramatic.      People that say that they have offense to whatever the material @MONTH1 be usually use the phrase '@CAPS1 it's offensive and i don't want my kid to stumble across it.' They say that they have a right to take whatever the 'offensive material' is off the shelf and keep it from the public. They couldn't be more right and stupid at the same time! If they have a right to take a certain thing off the shelf, then @ORGANIZATION1 (the writer of the song/book/movie) can claim that he @CAPS4 been offended by some song/book/movie that the first person likes. Then it's just a free-for-all for everyone one to start taking everything off the shelves, one by one. Everyone @CAPS4 the same rights, and if the first offended person uses them to bring @ORGANIZATION1 down, then @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 the right to do the exact same thing. So the government shouldn't let things be taken off of shelves, because if they take one down, they might as @CAPS1 take everything else down with it.     So, if some one finds offense to a song they hear on the radio, and they feel that strongly as to they want it removed from radios and anywhere that plays music, then they need help. When they find that song THAT offensive, then there is only one simple solution: turn the freaking radio to something else! Seriously, if someone finds the song offensive, then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song? Or if they find a book offensive. Would I sit and read an entire book if I don't like the content? Umm, no. If some one is that offended by whatever the material is, then they need to just do something else, because it's pretty rediculous to waste more time attempting to ban the song or the book that to just change the radio or find a different book. So if you're going to complain about the song or book being out there, just take your attention to something else, because every song, book, or movie out there @CAPS4 a right to be sold.     On a light note, they could just have an open mind so that the song, or the book, or the movie can still be sold. They can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author @CAPS4 written it this way. If they are conflicted by a movie, they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf. Or if they are listening to the song, listen to it all the way through, or maybe even twice. The artist who sang the song might have been expressing themselves in a very deep way, and if someone pulls their song off the radio or where @CAPS5 it is played, then someone could be offending them in return. Having an open mind will let the so called 'offended person' see a whole other light being shown on why the 'offensive material' was even created. Then everything can stay ON the shelves!     People have opinions, and that is one hundred percent okay. But sometimes people think that their opinions are the only opinions that matter. If some people get offended (or think they get offended) by something, they would try to removed whatever it was from the nations stores. But if they just sit back and think about it, then it would be okay. If they have a right to remove anything from the shelves, so does everyone. If that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 song really, really offends they, they should just change the radio station and forget about it. And if they have open minds as to why the things are still 'out there', then all the songs, and all the books, and all the movies will still be on the shelves for people to buy. I do not approve of removing anything from stores just because one person feels like if they don't like it, then it absolutly @CAPS4 to go. No, they world doesn't just revolve around one person, and it never, @CAPS5 will.",5,5,5,3
4580,2,"Yes, I do think so because everyone has an opinon to say and its something people like to look at or leason to. Now it would be diffeint if it was a childerins book store like if they have music like christin bible songs or desine movies in the store but not to have grown-up stuff.     I really do not see the big deal if they are out because everyone likes reading somthing differint. I think as long as your reading whats it matter what it is or as long as your learning something.      I do not think u can get stuff out like movies and magazines because people like to read them to much or leason to music. So it shoukld not really matter what or where they go if you ask me",2,2,2,0
4593,2,"Yes I believe certain material should be removed from the shleves at a library if they are offensive! because people dont want or like to go to any public library that is open to anyone, let them come in and @CAPS1 some book or etc offensive to that person.       Like a child grabbed some bad unapropriate book and his mommy found him reading it so she wasnt to happy and left. t @CAPS1 that could be offensive to anyone particular. Their are certain books, magaizines, etc that dont need to be in the library. Becasue the public doesnt need to @CAPS1 stuff like that in a public library.           By the way someone that could think that certain book in offensive could report that certain book or etc if it is offensive to someone that is irregular at that certain public library. So watch what you bring or put in a public library it has to apropriate to where all the publics that walk in to any nice library.     Being offensive, is not a good thing because you want to be able to walk in a nice public library and be relaxed not startled by any none reasonable book or magazines or etc that should be there.      Music is a big problem with people being offensive about it because theres so many unaproperiate, bad language music around here that they have to watch what they put in the library ecspecially for the little kids, seniors too.      Books are material that should be fun or interesting to read for people, not for people to look at or find on he shelves a offensive book or magazine because thats not what the library is for, its for going there relaxing and finding a book or etc to have and be good with, or checked out to use somewhere else",3,3,3,1
4594,2,"Books, Music, Movies, and Magazines have been taken off the shelvs.we are forever more blocking or cesoring these items. reasons why iot is a good idea is because their are children parents and religeous people who are so agains some of the thngs that are brodcasted if you want something uncensored then you can buy or rent an unrated version.          children are our future, why would you carrupt a mind so young and innocent? If your child is one second watching @CAPS1 and happy as can be and the next watching people being killd and the @CAPS2 bombs being droped that will forever be threre in his or hers mind. i dont think you would be to happy if your child was piucking up valgure language from the @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. Picture it your @NUM1 year old talking to you and then says an innappropreate word not knowing where it came from you just ignor it then that vacabulary grows into words and sentances much worse turning thins child into a bit of a potty mouth maybe even violent. we dont want our future presidents and authorities to be so violent that they put the woukd in danger just because they got if off the @CAPS3 do we?            Parents have the right to watch what they want but also have the authority to put a stop to what they dont want them and their @CAPS11 to view or even hear.More families these days enjoy taking car rrides together and vacations watching @CAPS3 and listening tgo the @CAPS4 as they go one minute they are all singing happy as can be unti a song with a bunch of innopproppreate words come on its not only dissrespectful but embarrasing to listen to your kids sing along to it. parents dont want to listen to that so they turn it off  everything is fine until they hear them again singing to their music divices @CAPS2,@CAPS8,@CAPS9, bombs all around the car their is no escape thats when parents should have a say to what their children are not only watching but listening and reading also. Books about @CAPS14 @CAPS13 and @CAPS15 are not something an @NUM2 year old should be reading we dont need them to be a bunch of stoners parents eaither. One minute you think you are reading a book about love and rommance next you read that the character is smoking a joint.         People with strong religeouns dont want to be watching @CAPS3 late at night and then be watching on @CAPS11 gut that @CAPS12 is doing @CAPS13 and sleeping with all these girls yes it @MONTH1 be funny to those non believers but to those who have a relligion it is just dissrespectful . Then listening to music hearing about people with no religion them lighting fires to crosses and using valgure language and the lords name in vein.not something they want to hear. When it comes to reading a book the religious have a strong oppinion on what should be read so they usually stick to the @ORGANIZATION1 but whjat happens when their kids go to school to fiind a fake @ORGANIZATION1 with nothing but lies and dirty pictures in it?       @CAPS3 shows, Music, Books, and magazines should always be censored it not only gives a good  example for everyone but it helps us as a community to stay strong. Not being violent or cursing after everything you say is not going to hurt anyone. Why would you want a future president to be a violent killing machine?  the environment we grow up in is how we turn out @CAPS13, @CAPS14, and @CAPS15 being read about or heard is not the way to be",3,3,3,1
4601,2,"Your @CAPS1     @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to.  It could be something someone said about one's relgion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive?  I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way.  @CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.     When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it.  The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it.  Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibiltyto protect from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements.     Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and in we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong.  I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do.  Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do.  Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching.  While others don'@CAPS3 see a problem with it.  So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out.  Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys.  With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them.  As with some parents they have their own rules.  Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.        A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6.  I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it.  It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie.  His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age.  He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote.  His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble.  I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.      It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on.  So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today.  We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed.  What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe.  So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don'@CAPS3 believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it",3,3,3,1
4602,2,"How many of you out there absolutely love to read? Well, im going to be the first to confess that I do not prefer reading. Meanwhile, whether or not I prefer or differ readings of all types, I despise of any negative books. Censoring books is very important in today's lifestyle. One can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book. The cover oftens creates a vivid image and will usually promote a general idea. Let's look at some reasons why I feel that graphic or offensive books should be removed from book shelves.          What about the younger children who like to read? Although kids have a wild imaginaion, authors should't fill their heads with too many crazy ideas. First of all, kids now days either grab a book from the shelf and show interest very quickly, or automatically assume it's not for them. Furthermore, when a kid comes across a very offensive book it could hurt there feelings. Books are supposed to provide eductional information or be entertaining. They should not be dirty, nor discouraging towards certain people.           More importantly, how many different races are there here in @LOCATION1, or even all around the world? Many different races take interest in new books to learn new ways. When they come across books that are not teaching for all races or are actknowledging bad examples on thier kind, they feel discouraged. Whether it's a movie, magazine, books, or even a song, never should it be offensive towards anyone. When authors, publishers, song writers, or movie producers release these items, they do not think of the surroundings. Thier main concept is to entertain, but sometimes entertainment can be quite bashful.           Most importantly, if it contains sexual gestures it should be removed without debate. It's offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries. A public library which is open to all, should have sections for books, movies, cd's or magazines that are too vivid. There's a wide range of books laying around and one @MONTH1 come across one that is strongly offensive. I believe they should have a word in whether or not the book belongs on the shelf or not. I've not experienced it yet, but believe me it could happen anytime in our world today. If i was a parent I wouldn't encourage sexual magazines or books being shown at a public library.      Finally, during this debate older or more dirty minded people will counterargue this topic. Who says children should be allowed in the adult sections? Why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples? Those are some of the questions you will here for those who counter what I've written today. Adults should be allowed there own personal section for adultlike books, movies, or magazines. Kids under age should stick to searching for books in areas or fields that will provide interest for them.      In conclusion, those who counterargue could be on the winning side, however I still believe offensive books should be removed from shelves. Book lovers all around the world want enteratinment, but in good ways. The younger children of our time right now need to be influenced the proper way. Furthermore, there is no better way to help improve society than by removing offensive and noninfluential books from libraries. Lets make an inference and say, if we work to remove these offensive books, younger children will become more educated.",4,4,4,2
4607,2,"Do yo think censorship is a good thing? Do you think libraries should take more responsability on what they offer to people? Many people think they should. But I disagree, if they dont want to learn about that topic than don't read the book.          Public libraries are a great help for the community. They are reallly helpful for children who dont have certain materials at home. Libraries do think about what information children view. That is why there are restricted areas for children of certain age. Also its not always about what the library displays, but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read. If to some people some information is offensive, to others it might not. People will always have different points of view.           This materials cannot be removed, they might be important in some  points of our lifes. All information is helpful in some way. The inmense ammount of knowledge our libraries have should not be taken away just because someone want to",3,3,3,1
4608,2,"Librarys are filled with hundreds of materials that many @CAPS4 like and dislike. Books on @PERSON1 and @CAPS1, @CAPS2. Those books are @CAPS3 there to offend you they're there to educate you on the subject.           Censorship should be only for the youth as an adult you are open to everything. You make your own desicons and live by them. If you feel like a book, a song, a movie, is offensive, then stop reading, listening, or watching. @CAPS3 everyone gets offended.          I believe that no citizen has the right to remove anything from a library because of the @NUM1- @CAPS3 every one is @NUM2- @CAPS4 have diffrent @CAPS2 and outlooks on @NUM3- @CAPS5 the @CAPS6.     I conclude this by saying that censorship is enforced, but shouldnt be to a great extent, @CAPS7 us do what we do, and learn what we learn. In school were forsed to learn what we learn, i believe @CAPS5 right to have out side knowledge, but only way that is that we get it from data bases such as computers, books, music, art, etc",3,3,3,1
4611,2,"What if one day you took a trip to the library, and you came across a book that was offensive? Would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it? Every year tons of @CAPS1 visit libraries in search of a good book, threw act of observations and personal appeal. Everyone has a different choose in the types of books they'd like to read, with that comes offensive and non-offensive material.     Being a teen i've had some experience visiting the library where things come across as offensive to me more easily than others but like many i choose to ignore it. Reasons for ignoring it are rather simple, everyone has different takes on things in which they've gathered since birth as we'll as personal life experiences. Because, everyone has different life experiences comes different views on what offends them or not. Personal experiences i've had in the library are from race seeing books that relate to the days of slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to me. But, a book on the black panther organization maybe offensive to someone else. So, does that mean it should be taken down off the shelf because it is offensive to both people?     Books have diffent tones weither its on life, politics, or worldly issues that make different people feel different ways. I've observed plenty of times where someone feels uplifted from reading a book. Where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible. Take a magazine for instance, one reader could look like that beautiful women in that magazine and feel great about themselves. While maybe an overweight reader could read the same magazine and feel like there not beautiful or self worthy as the women in the magazine. That overweight women could feel offended, while the other women feels amazing, because of that simple reason it shouldn't be taken off the shelves due to different views of what offends them and what doesn't.     Everyone reads books due to there liking and what relates to them. If a book, magazine, or movie comes across as offensive then that reader probably won't pick it up to find out more about it. When i come across material in a library that is offensive to me i won't read it. Although i have picked up books that didn't come across as offensive, but after reading the material come to find out it was offensive. In response i simply returned the book and chose another one.     If i walked into a library and saw a book that was offensive to me i wouldn't ask for it to be taken off the shelf i would simply ignore it. Everyone has different views on what offense them so there's not much you can do except just ignore it. If the case was that if a book were to offend someone and it was taken out of a library due to just that there would be no real need for a library",3,4,3,1
4613,2,"To the newspaper edits,Should books, music, movies, magzines, and other reading materials, be removed if the materials are view to be offensive?     I do not think that is a good idea. Reasons why is that just like what @PERSON1 an Author (in the last sentence) said if we remove books from shelfs there will be 'no more books for any of us to read'. That is true because I am sure there are lotts of books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people but maybe the readers who get offensive do not understand the materials that they read. For example the topic of liking the same gender has become a problem, maybe the reader who gets offensived about those types of topics just do not understand it or @MONTH1 not get it.      An other reason why could be because we are in america, and the last time I checked we have the free will to write and talk about what we want to talk or write about. Its fair to say that because well, it is true we has people of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 just have the 'right' to say what they want to say or what is on their mind. And just because the topic of the reading material offensives them does not mean you can take away the writers material. Doing that is like putting duck tape on the writers mouth. If the reader has the right to say what in on your mind then what is the maining of being free to write what you wish to write. If you can see where I am coming from it takes a lott not to talk to a teacher or someone in a highter postition from the reader, about something you do not understand and they tell you 'you can not ask me that' or 'do not say a thing to me' it is the same if you remove the book from the writer.     Other reasons why to say no to removing the reading material could be because has humans we always are willing to learn something new, by @CAPS3. When a person reads they always learn something new. It could be a new event, a place unknown, grammer, the diffrent styles of writing, or know more about the topic. @CAPS3 in books, music, movies, and magazines is a good way to learn new things it is fun and what is better then @CAPS3 something fun? can not think of anything? well it is because @CAPS3 has a big role in our lives.     Another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it @MONTH1 make other reads feel like they are not alone. Like a true story about a break up, of a family or a relationship. Or it could be a story base on something that happening to the writer like about a death of a loved @CAPS5 and how to deal with it. Just picture it two @CAPS4 girls, @CAPS5 is mad at herself  and at the world and hates a tape about angles. While the other @CAPS4 girl just lost her grandmother and listening to the tape about angles makes her feel together or whole, knowing that her loved @CAPS5 is in a good place. Now think about it the second girl would start to be like the first girl sad, alone, or leaved out. When you take away a material like a small tape from the librarie's shelf you take away a feeling with it not only from the writer but from the reader's too.     Finally the last reason why not to remove the materials from the shelfs is because if you remove the material from the shelf it is likly that the topic is still there. It could be on the radio, on the internet, on the @ORGANIZATION1 and what can you do delete all of that? it is not reality. And if that could even happening which is unlikly that it would people can still talk. And there is nothing that can stop people from talking. 'you can lock a bird in a cage but it still wants to fly away' or 'you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away but when you turn away it is gone' this are explambles of what I am trying to say, you can try to remove books, music, magazines, but the topic you dont like is still out there.     I understand that reading some materials @MONTH1 offend you but its better to just turn your head around and move on.The reader @MONTH1 not like the topic but others would and thats always good to think about. And maybe the problem is that the reader does not get the topic then maybe you should read it to learn from it, and to give it a chance you @MONTH1 end up likeing it or understanding it better. Books, music, movies, magazines there is a reason why they are out there and it could teach you something new so why not  learn it.",3,4,3,1
4615,2,"Communities have many different types of people that live in them. Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally nomal. Some of these things cause conflict. A library, for example, is one place you @MONTH1 find some of these conflicts.     Most libraries are open to the public. Therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to please everyone, some people @MONTH1 find some of the material offensive. Now for the big question: Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together?     The answer to this big question is no. Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community. People are different and believe in different things. Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, things such as religion. Someone @MONTH1 find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others @MONTH1 strongly believe in that reigion. Just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them.     Libraries are for all kinds of people. Just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left. People believe in different things. That is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be",3,4,3,1
4617,2,"Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion,gender,etc.       If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but to another person it @MONTH1 not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines,movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library.      I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else. If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out.      If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child @MONTH1 learn something new from the book.      Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie,magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic. It @MONTH1 help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of.      One condition on why a book,movie,magazine,music,etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it @MONTH1 be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book.      The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out. If that was what happened everytime someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person",4,4,4,2
4621,2,"Books, music and movies are all important, specially to kids. If we decide to take one book off of the shelf, then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty. The same idea for movies, magazines, music, ect. Even though, some parents do not accept it for their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' role to supervise their children and choose for them and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch.      Libraries usually require @CAPS1 cards. These @CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adults' materials depending on the kind of card the person has. Since it is the parents' decision to decide the materials their children have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their chilren have taken something they don't like off of the shelf. Libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society.      If we try to remove every single book, movie, song, or magazine that contain an offensive thing, we would have to remove almost everything. People have different cultures and beliefs. They might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing.      In the current society, a lot of people are more attratced to movies or music that contain some unappropriate materials because these materials have recently taken over in the media. We can't stop publishing them but we can censor them. There are different kinds of channels that view these materials. Internet, @ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be under parents' supervision. Thus, parents can not blame anyone other than themselves, if their children read or saw unacceptable materials.      Libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change. Parents need to have full supervision to their children. Libraries enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the persons age",4,4,4,2
4623,2,"In my life time I have been to many libraries. I also seen many diffrent catagories of books suck as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and etc. As we all know there are many topics out thier that is not suitable for minors or suitable for many other ages.     Movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes. For example in cartoons their are sexual content such as kissing .Some parents don't want their child expose to the kind of activity yet. Movies somtimes put false beliefs in peoples mind about the way things are, going to be,or the why you sould see it.Their are also some good movies place in libraries such ass docomentries, history , biography, and etc. Thats gives you good insite on how things was and hoe things are now.     Another topic is magazines. Its strange things going on in the world that @CAPS1 sould be aware of the why we put them in magazines but children have easy access to them in libraries. Picture that magzines have are images that sould be places in some magazines. As there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine. Magazines are in some ways just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information.     Music is aslo a big topic thats placed in libraries. Some of the lauguage thats is place on  cd tracks are good BUT  theirs alot of bad material that on them also. So many people out the known as @CAPS2 say some very harsh and profaine words that many and children sould just not want to hear. Like I said before as their is bad thier is much good. We have gospel , jazz, @CAPS3&@CAPS4, and etc that many people enjoy listing to.     In conclusion thier are many things good that belongs in libraries but also many bad. Libraries in my opinion sould take more caution on what people have access to. Very easy a young child (that can read) can pick up a adult book go sit in a corner read and be expose to most things parents are expose to. So in my opinion yes certin things should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive.",4,4,4,2
4627,2,"I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries, if they are found to be offensive. We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read.     If the media is offensive, than someone's feelings will get hurt. I remember a time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive things about homeless people. I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people. Which in a lot of cases isn't true, but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it. Those people now rudely look down on them. So why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books.     There is a lot of offensive music too. Today most of the songs people listen to are, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, cause anybody could rent them. Which isn't good, cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay.     Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines. Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories. So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all.     The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay, or not are definately movies. They need to realize that kids could rent these, and think are they apporiate. I think libraries should only have family oriented movies. This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw.      In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try stop anybody from getting harmed",3,3,3,1
4633,2,"Books, magazines and misic should be removed if it has something offensive to the person or the child. Books, magazines, music can cause children or adults to have a big imagination and as they grow or are thinking that its a right way to do things. All this things that are not for a proper use shoud be displade of were no children or adult have it in use. I believe that this can hust people as they grow up or adults thinking its the right way to do things. Books and music should be removed if not used for something that is in good use.      Books magazines that have no material use and its used for pornagrafi or something else should be taken off shelfs. Kids and as adults have a big imagination that could sometimes hurt others as well as family members. Book magazines and music provide imspiration not to come to the fact that it comes to peoples distraction.thesse are way that by sometimes not knowing u hurt ur love one because of what u see, read or hear.this can the be the biggest effects on people.      The supplies you get like books, magazine, and music arent helping you and are caousing more problems in your life they should be take of markets. Also people sometimes decied to buy them beacause of what the pictures have instored for you in a good day. another thing that causes them to be taken of shelfs is the thought that u can get by looking and hearin and reading.This are all bad things for anybody to be ready or lisening to.     I belive that books, magazines and music should be taken off because its nothing good for the brain and it dosnt help you in any way. Also things that arent used for good are not use full.In my opinion, I think that trashy books and music sometimes it can take you to suiside or into making something cazy that later on you will regret.This is why nun od thoese things are use full for a person or a child     In conclusion, I think that books, magazines and music that are not use full shoul be taken of shelfs and should be putting things that do help the mind.Things that are not resorsful for a person mind should be put away.All this things came into not having estability in life and cometing rong steps that take you into failure.Finaly I think that all unresorsful books, magazines and music should be put away",3,3,3,1
4634,2,"I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. First, you have to consider what is offensive to most people, and who should be the people to determine if it should be sensored or not. People should be able to decide for themselves if they can or cannot get an item off of a shelf, because they might not even consider it offensive. If you are a parent, you have the right to not let your children watch or read certain materials, but you can't get it taken off the shelf because then it prohibits other people from being able to get that same material that they think is acceptable.      Things that are offensive range from cussing all the way to extreme violence. Some people @MONTH1 not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence, but others will find it very offensive. In my personal experience, I tend not to think that a little cussing is offensive, but I do know some people who balk even hearing one minor cuss word. Many movies nowadays are made up of content that is mildly offensive, but only if you take it seriously. The movies make fun of things that people might find offensive, which probably offends those people even more, but they do not have to watch it if they don't want that movie! It just depends on the person and what they have grown up around, or what they think is right or wrong.      It is either your own responsiblity or a parents responsibility to determine whether the content of a book or movie is appropriate. Many times parents use the argument that children are too young to make the judgement on a book or movie, and that is very true. So most children movies and books are appropriate, and do not include content that children are not quite ready to handle. If you are older, then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age. Many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books in movies because those things are already in your life. It comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age.      The idea about taking these books off the shelves would be disastarous. The reading lists in schools would have to be cut down because parents didn't approve, and the children would lose valuable knowledge that is in most literature. One person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive. There would be nothing left in libraries if one person did not approve of something because then every item would have at least one person disapprove.I once read To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and our teacher told us that in another state this book had been banned because a couple of parents didn't like one or two things from the book. This book has many valuable ideas and lessons, and is considered a great piece of literature. These parents wanted the book to be banned from all schools, and all libraries all over the country, and that would be infringing on other people's rights of freedom of speech. The parents can say what they want about the book and not let their own child read it, but they cannot stop that opportunity for everyone else who wants to read the book. Taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well. Literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture. There have been so many movements over time, many started with literature and it affected the culture and the people. Censorship would just take away a part of our culture, which would be devestating.      You should look at your own life, and think about what you find offensive. Then step into someone else's shoes that does not think it is offensive, and see if it is worth it to take it all away from everyone. Almost everything could be considered offensive to at least one person, but it is your own resposiblity to decide whether it is appropriate for you or your child. The shelves should stay full of books, movies, music and magazines. It is our way of expressing freedom of speech, and that is an integral part of our country and our culture",4,4,4,2
4636,2,"People should have a right to listen, read, and watch whatever they want. It is people's own choice to what they read, watch, or listen to. They will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books. They will only go somewhere else and do it.      People have a right to read, listen to, and watch what they feel is good for them. If others find that offensive then that is their problem. People make their own decisions and that is their right. I feel that if you tell someone that they can not do a certain thing that will only make them want to do it more.      Taking offensive books, music, movies, and magazines will not solve a problem that our society has with being offensive to others, it will only mask it. Taking them out will not all of a sudden make people stop being offensive to others, they just won't do it in libraries.            Every book, music or movie will be offensive to some other person and if we take all the offensive stuff out there will be nothing left to read. It is just something that we will have to deal with. So I do not agree with censorship in libraries.      It will only take away our right to read and view what we want but also it will take away all the offensive movies and books we have; which is almost every book. Everyone feels that one book or another if offensive to them and if we take away those books we will have nothing left in our libraries",3,3,3,1
4638,2,"In the book fahernheit @NUM1 all books get burned no matter what they contain and the people are always sad and depressed about everything. Books are an improtnat part of our lives. Some materials do need to be cencored because it might offend some people that are all ready have a hard time with being who they are without these things to add to the flame. Their are some books that are being censored for little to no reason. There might be a rude or a miss understood word that caused books to be unnessisary cencored. Cencorship is important to libraries when used correctly.     We need books for many things from learning to simply use up time. Music has been with mankind since the beginning. Movies show us the ups and downs of life. Magazines inform us on what new and interesting. These things have become imprtant to us as clothes and food. Simply taking these out will make the world will make it a darker palce to live.      Some of these things will cause people to be offended without trying to be. Katherine Paterson says that if I had the right to get rid of a book that offended me then everyone can too and soon all of the bookes will be gone .. We can try to be nice to every one, but somepoint something will insult someone no matter what we do or say. Do we need to get rid of everything for that reason?",2,2,2,0
4655,2,"Do I believe that certain materials, suchs as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed for being offensive? No I do not. My opinion on the varieties of things found in our library are good. Most of it is very helpful information. Some people might not like some things because of what they have in it or on them, but most of it is history. You can't change that. If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magaine, they shouldn't read it.     I have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects. If we need to know about slaves or slavery, we can go to our library. Some peoples views on that is totally different, but hey. We can't help what people did in the past. We can only learn from their mistakes. I say if you don't like what you see on the front of the cover, don't read it. Look for something else more interesting to you.      I have not found one thing in our library offensive to me. Or even bad. They have books over everything. Some of it can be bad, but mostly it all is good information. They talk about history, and guns and drugs, and wars and all sorts of other history information. There are books over stuff that isn't even true.     I think people @MONTH1 over react on some things. If you don't like a book or movie, don't get it. Look at the cover and if it seems appealing, get it. But if not, don't waste time on complaining about it. Because then things can get out of control.      That is my opinion on books, movies, magazines, etc in our libraries. Mainly they seem very helpful, but others can have different opinions",4,3,4,2
4660,2,"We have all been to a library at some point in our life. Have you ever been looking around and seen something that @MONTH1 have been offensive, or something you didnt agree with? What if you had the chance to have if takin off the shelves for good? Or, what if someone else had the choice to? Would you allow them to do so?     In my opinion, I would say no. Someone does not have the right to take reading material off the shelves, just because it @MONTH1 be offensive to them, or there way of life. I say, if you do not like it, do not look at it, it is simple as that. For example, what if you were into rap, or the hip hop culture, and someone finds that offensive? Would you give them the right to keep it from you? Or, would you really want to do that to someone else?  Lets say you are a christian, and an atheist finds the @CAPS1 offence, or untruthfull, so he has it takin off the shelves. Does that sound fair to you? If someone was to not like a certain topic or culture, or finds it offensive, all they would have to do, is simply stay away from it.     The point is, if we all were to take something off the shelves, there would adventually be nothing left. Respect what other cultures and ways of life do, and stay away from what offends you. Would you like someone to have what you like takin off the shelves? I would not, so you should not do that to other people.",3,3,3,1
4662,2,"When people think of a library they think of a quiet place to study and read. Teachers use the libraries for many different things. One thing they use it for is movies on certain topics. Another is for books on certain people or events. They even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up on the world outside of school. So what is my opinion on offensive materials getting removed? I'll tell you what it is.     Kids watch movies in class all the time. Some are not appropriate at times, but some are very insiteful and helpful. I think if the teacher watches the movie first and thinks that it is too bad for children in say elementary it should be banned from that schools library, but for high schoolers chances are they have heard or seen worse. So with saying that movies should stay in the libraries of high schools but not all should stay in the elementary's.     Books are another good resource if used correctly. They help kids in history learn about old war hero's and past events. Some books should be kept behind the counter and only used for certain classes though. Like for instance books that tell specifics about drugs. They should be taken off the shelves , put behind the counter; and if someone really needs a book about them like for medicine purposes to become a doctor then all they have to do is ask.     Magazines are good for a couple of different nice things. One thing is projects. If you have to do a project over something like food and cant use a computer, magazines are a great way to get good pictures. Another thing its commonly used for is just flat out entertainment. Like when you get bored of reading a book that you just picked out because of looks or if a book is too hard to read you could get a magazine.     So in reality some things should be kept and others taken away. People spend lots of time in the library for many different things and that will never change. Movies are a good source of entertainment and that won't change either. So I guess i'm half and half on keeping or getting rid of offensive materials.",3,4,3,1
4663,2,"My view opposes the open distribution of certain newspaper articles. There are certain articles, radio shows, and other sources of media that vividly describe certain things that happen in the news that I find not to be appropriate for some people to hear such as younger children, or people that don't agree with having to listen to things such as: bias reactions, opinions, and interpretations of these things.      Open distribution of newspaper articles and things containing disturbing images ought to be censored. I recently seen photos of people who have been killed in the process of finding @LOCATION1. I find that these images @MONTH1 serve some importance to people interested, but for children who can look on their doorstep and look at the newspaper, can see horrifying images that some people @MONTH1 think they shouldn't be exposed to. Even as adults people don't necessarily agree with it. Adults @MONTH1 see what's in the news and @MONTH1 find it to be intriguing as it pertains to them or fairly disturbing, but as far as the protection and limited exposure their children @MONTH1 have, it @MONTH1 not be such a good thing for their kids to be hearing.      I was in the car heading back from school one day, and my dad had just picked me up from school, and I casually switch the raido from am to fm as I always do when I get in the car, but I didn't hear the sudden outbreak of a top one hundred song as I had expected, I heard a woman asserting her opinion about the death of @LOCATION1 to a talk radio show host. The show had previously been recorded, and so after the woman had lashed out for being so angry about the whole thing, there was a review of other calls that other people had made in mad frustration about the womans' comments. She had said earlier that it was wrong to have killed somebody, in which the talk radio show host responded with the argument that it was okay for @LOCATION1 to kill thousands, but we can't kill him argument. The reviews that the other callers had made sort of disturbed me. The things that the callers were saying were very offensive towards the woman who had expressed her feelings. The other callers were saying that she needed to get out of our country, and were cursing at her. News like the death of @LOCATION1 isn't just violent in itself, but creates reactions that are very violent as well.      Another instance when I was exposed to some information that @MONTH1 not have been well accepted by others was when we were having an assembly meeting at my school, and we watched a video about a protest that was against people of @CAPS1 belief. The whole problem with the protest was that the people of the @CAPS1 faith were born in @LOCATION3, and were meeting with representatives in order to help a poor community in @LOCATION2. Although they were making an effort to help the poor communities, and homeless people in @LOCATION2 there were people shouting at the im protest to leave, and to go back to where they came from. When people hear things about this in the news it can be very offensive, because although it @MONTH1 be happening on a complete opposite coast, it would be able to effect someone, it can easily effect someone who doesn't understand previous conflicts that would shape these peoples' opinions and @MONTH1 take that very offensively, because it is a very complex matter even though it is still very wrong.      I believe that the material that is being exposed to people of all ages should be censored, because the material that is being openly distributed now isn't necessarily suitable for everyone, and some people @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, and want to avoid the news that is going around about certain topics that they @MONTH1 not be comfortable with",4,4,4,2
4664,2,"I think that if a book can be published then it should be able to be in a library. If a book is published then it means it's open to the public so I don't see why it can't be in the libraries. If a book has to be removed from a library then why did they buy it?      I really don't see the need to take a book off the shelf in a library. If someone dosen't like it then they don't have to get it. I beleive that only the owner of the library should be the only one to take a book off a shelf because it is their own store, but why would they waste the money in buying the book.     The public shouldn't be able to remove books from libraries because not everyone likes the same kind of books. Everyone has different views also. If anyone could remove  books from libraries then there wouldnt be any books in the library.     A book is a book. Not a criminal so why remove books from libraries? If a book can be published then it can be put in libraries. There is no reason for a book to be taken off the shelf because its been published so it's already open to the public.",3,3,3,1
4665,2,"I don't think a magazine should be taken off the shelves just because someone is offended. People get offended all the time but do you see them trying to get what ever it is that made them fell like that. I have been offended by cartoons before but you don't see me crying about it you just have to suck it up and go on with life. Cartman from the tv show @LOCATION1 is the most offensive characters on that show. He uses every offensive language known to mankind.      He makes fun of all the racees, he says he hates everyone equally. But still you can't stop it that is like trying to get a dog to be a cat it just wont happen. It is also like trying to get rid of racecism. That is what I think about finding something offencive.",2,2,2,0
4667,2,"Censorship in librarys can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be somethings that you @MONTH1 not want your children to read. But there also can be things that you do want them to read. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you dont want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines.     If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that @MONTH1 not be offensive at all. This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad. I am sure that there @MONTH1 be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it @MONTH1 still be offensive to others. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that @MONTH1 be offensive to more than a small group. Lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first books material is very well written and @MONTH1 have offensive material in it here and there. The second book is also well written but @MONTH1 not all be there the whole story @MONTH1 not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally I would rather read the book that @MONTH1 have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happend.     Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would but if your writing about something that happend in your life that could have been offensive to others they @MONTH1 not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life. Than why show your children a book that isn't true? Im not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective. Maybe there perspective of what happend is alot different than yours, but that can be a good thing. Even with the offensive material books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others.     I have went to librarys and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored. But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group. I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. A book that @MONTH1 have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people. That does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the persons perspective if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldnt find offensive.     Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to @MONTH1 not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it. I would want it to be read, seen, and heard. Censorship @MONTH1 be good for some and bad for others. If you are a person that allways likes a happy ending then maybe censorship is good. But if you want the whole story that can be non-fiction or fiction then censorship is not for you.",4,4,4,2
4675,2,"No i do not figure that. I say that there is some material for adults, teens and children. The children aren't going to want to read the adult books and the adults aren't going to wanna read the childrerns books the teens aren't going to want to read the childrens books but they @MONTH1 want to read the adult books and thats ok. They will be adults soon they @MONTH1 be interested. there is nothing wrong with that. If the parents do not want there teens or children reading that kindf of material then they should go with them to the libary and make them  get you approvial befor checking out the books, magazines or wwhatever it is they wanna read at the time. Movies are the samje there are different materials for each age group some age groups @MONTH1 be interested in other age groups material and thats ok doesn't maen it's wrong just means thetre maturing more and are interested or couriouse let them explore they will figurt for them serlfs if the material is righrt for them or not",2,2,2,0
4679,2,"In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read.  For instance movies, are we going to go let a @NUM1 year watch a rated @CAPS1 movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it.  Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they @MONTH1 not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for.     Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'. After watching all @NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again.  Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible.     To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section.  This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well.  I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas?     Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up.  There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the @CAPS3.  If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is.  Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is.  Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever.  Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things.",4,4,4,2
4681,2,"I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read. Most people don't want to read @CAPS1 or a novel. Some people want to read about crimes, mysterys, and action. There are alot of good movies out there but some of them I can agree with are too offensive to others. I gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said. For example: @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to some people is very offensive. The only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life.     I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended. Books about war to some people are too graffic. But those books about war are probably books about history. I have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like. But back in the @DATE1's people didn't care about what was in a library. They just want something to read. I say leave the librarys alone!",3,3,3,1
4687,2,"Have you ever read something that you have found offensive, upsetting, or has made you mad? Do you think that there are certian books that shouldn't be allowed in a library because of its content? A lot of books, music, movies, and magazines these days contain things that are hurtful to society or protray bad images of certian social groups.      In @DATE1's society there are many different groups of people and a lot of them have thier own opinions on how they view different things. To me, when I think about a library, I think about how all different ages of people go to them, how there are many different groups of people there, and about the types of books that are in there. Taking this all into concideration, I believe that everything should be allowed in public libraries but I do think that there should be seperate places for books, magazines, and movies that should be only for adults. I think this because if you take away all the things that are 'bad' or 'offensive' to you, you could be displeasing those who find these things interesting or enjoy reading them. In this case, people would not come to the library anymore because they cannot read what they enjoy reading or find interesting.      By saying these things, seperating the books into age groups is a good thing because then the younger children who are running around the library will not pick up something that they should not be looking at. I also believe that is would benefit them because then if someone comes into the library looking for a book but does not really know what to do and they go to where their age group would be; then they can see everything that is recommended for them.      From my own experience, I know that I have read some books and looked at some magazines that I probably should not have looked at because I was too young. This does not mean that they need to take them off the shelves but maybe that they should be placed in an area where someone my age will not be able to find them. So the next time you go to the library and see something that is offensive to you, just remember that there are a lot of different people in this world who might find what you think is offensive, interesting",4,4,4,2
4688,2,"Yes, there are a lot of books out there that have graphic and sexual phrases, and there are alot of concernd parents out there that are worried about what the libraries are possibly letting their kids read. One good idea would be to put age limit signs in certain areas on the libraries, that dosent neccisarrly mean that the kid is goin to listen to that sign.           We all know for a fact that pornagraphy will stay away from libraries and stay were they are at right now so thats not an issue the parents should worry about. I think the libraries should be broken onto sections. Theres a kid section, a teen section, and a adult section, but i don't think that the adult section should be to far off the teen section because when we say adult books or magazines everybody expects it to be one thing, porn. It should still be some type of book with some kind of censorship to it.      There should be doors blocking each entrance to each section of books, and to get to them you to show the librarian some proof of age to be able to get into those sections, except the kid section. The kid section is a section that all kids can use, because we know that that section of books would be harmless to kids. I think that with that kind of security it would let parents to be able to be less stressed and worried for their childs safety and insecurity of the mind.     There are tons of other ideas to explore to be able to try and keep books with some kind of censorship but most of them are off the wall and rediculus. I think that musoc and movies shouldn't even be in libraries just leave those to other stores it's better to let stores deal with that than libraries. The librarian probably dosen't even know half the cds that probably get checked out anyways. So it's best if you don't have those in there at all.     Give some thought to these ideas that I just sprong at you. I personally think that having doors blocking to get to certain books would be a great plan to use, because it would block access to these areas from certain kids. Some other parents or people might have ideas of there own and it would be great to hear them or have some kind of bullitun about them around the city ofr town",4,3,4,2
4690,2,"Cencorship is a very large thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is sutable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see.      Firstly, people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of @CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it.      Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express them selves. Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their head. @PERSON1 was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could.      Although, somethings we need to see the things that people have in @CAPS8 heads. I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out.      In conclution, @CAPS8 is no real yes or no anser. @CAPS8 is always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read",3,3,3,1
4694,2,"Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety",4,3,4,2
4696,2,"Hi, my name is mason and i'm writing about wether we should take books off the self and etc. People have differnt views on differnt things.     Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while.     Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole. It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game.     When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know.     Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot.     So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point. It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too",3,3,3,1
4700,2,"All things in the world are not strictly black and white. Every person is different, with varying ideas. So when some people are certain that a specific word or topic should be restricted, there will always be another person to say the exact opposite. Sometimes, what's found as 'vulgar' can only be introduced with the intent of education. Also, this ties in with something our country was founded on, which is freedom of the speech, and the press.      Magazines, music, books and movies are mainly for entertainment. Everyone who reads or watches something will take it in differently, and it will have a varying effect. Let's say there is a @NUM1-year-old girl who just had her first day of high school. While at lunch, she slipped and dropped her tray of food. Later that day while she's alone reading her favorite magazine, she's reading an article about embarrassing stories, where one girl accidentally walked into a boys' restroom. Some parents @MONTH1 deem this inappropriate, but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation.      It's human to mess up and act crazy; we aren't perfect by nature. So when we see errors made into comedies and dramas by any form of media, it's human to realize that we aren't the only ones who undergo these events. To censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens. Not to say that a novel written about brutal murder that contains sexual references should be given to a little kid, but it should not be pulled from the shelf all together.      The topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one, especially with younger kids. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to remove a book that they thought was not suitable, then eventually there would be nothing left. Many parents are uneasy with the thought of their child being taught things like sexual education, but on the other hand, there are also the parents who appreciate it. They do so not because it saves them time, but because certain explicit topics - to an extent - can help someone mature if it's done in a controlled environment.      Years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media. It could range from saying 'intercourse' to replace 'sex' or it could be something like extreme propoganda. There's a reason that our consitution protects freedom of speech. No matter how appauling someone @MONTH1 find a topic, it usually has some type of informative purpose. Otherwise, it probably wouldn't have gotten issued.      Choosing what is and isn't offensive is a matter of opinion. As previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and their opinions won't be either. So this means that if one person out of a group is allowed to dispose of or censor whatever they find necessary, it must be recognized that some portion of the remaining people will be unsatisfied. This is usually where people will claim that the law protects their freedom of speech. In the end, the media is largely for entertainment. It provides numerous shows and articles, with a huge array of topics. This goes to show that if one should find something offensive, it doesn't mean they have to rip it off the shelves and complain; it simply means they have the opportunity look elsewhere",4,4,4,2
4702,2,"I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library. If they have a problem with certain material in certiain books they should bring it to the attention of the library. The auther who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. If somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundries that the parents have set.     However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as @ORGANIZATION1. On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with @CAPS1 magazines either. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that. But they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf.     Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge. But you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you.",3,3,3,1
4707,2,"There's bad, and good books out there. Some people find different books affensive, to what they do. Other's like the books that other people dislike. In a way books are both bad and good. Good, because people start to read better after reading a lot, and bad because a lot of people dislike to read.     I think that when you go in a library there should be impropet books for people to read. Children go in library's, what if they pick up a bad book and form horriable habits? Children, and adults have very different views on what to read. Kids want to read fairytale stories, etc. Adult's on otherhand enjoy mystery storys about murder, and such.     Yes, library's can let people check out any book they find interesting; But, what if that book is bad for there children to see lying around. It's simple if you make sure you don't leave your books just lying anywhere, kid's wouldn't form bad habits, or discover anything there not suppose to know. Kid's are noises, and they will try to read your books, or see something bad on a magizine.     In library's, there is the children's section, and the adult section. That helps in some way's, but your child can still find that bad book, etc at home. Parents can keep from this for the safety of there childrens thought's, or qeustions about that certain book, etc that they found. It's good to just put thing's away when your done, and keep every bad book, etc out of your childs react.     Books are bad, and good. You can find the information you need, or something you really don't want to read about, or see. Books have stuff that we sometime's need to know, and want to know more about. If your kid finds a misleading book, make sure they didn't read it, or look at it; and just hide it away from them. In the end, the problem will be solved.",3,3,3,1
4712,2,"Although it is a new day and age where damand is high for elctronic books, hard back and paper back books are not obsolete quite yet. Many people still like the old tradition of traveling to libraries, and starting the quest for the perfect book.    Also, with the economy at a downfall, it is the cheaper way to go. But the big question is, can people find everything they desire at their local library? For some people that maynot be the case because of library censoring.     Yes it is true that many libraries now censore many things that they would think would be inapproite for childrens eyes. I agree that some things should not be displayed on shelves at libraries. Although some adults or teens desire more mature actricles, these things should not be avaible for children to view. One of the most loyal customers to the library are children and their parents. Parents do not want their children to be exposed to explicet materials at that young of an age. Also if libraries lose young families as customers, that would be almost half their clientel gone down the drain.     So next time when you want to buy something that maybe to mature for children, you might want to reconsider going to the library. Instead go to a book store and buy whatever you need there. Keep children in a safe, innocent environment",3,3,3,1
4713,2,"Do I believe certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive?  No, just because a book or song or magazine article or movie is offensive does not mean that we should have the right to take it off the shelves.  Sure we have a right to remove that book but there are a lot things that are going to offend people.      Just because someone comes across an offensive book at the library doesn't mean that they should have to go through so much work to get it removed off the shelf.  Its not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books.  If it was possible for anyone to just take a book off a shelf because they thought it was offensive we would have a lot of empy book stores.  Because face it people can and will be offended easily if something they believe, like religion, is being made fun of in a book that they had read about.       We all get offended but just move on from it and find something different.  We are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine.  We have a choice and the choice can be to move on and read or look at something different, more positive, or go through the process to get it removed and taken off the shelf.  You never know someone else might think that maybe that article in that magazine was benefitial or relating.  So it should not be up to one person, but if a whole community has a problem with a book then I can see removing it can be an option",3,3,3,1
4720,2,"I believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side. The good side is profanity is it give books, music, and movies taste and texteure it shows how a person feels most times it's anger. Profanity also can change a person behavior, by the way people talk and act. I personally think that profanity is a good and bad i like it in music and movies but i hate it when people talk trash. I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the person age for example age three and thirteen books should not contain profanity but ages fourteen and up can.           The reason why people should take it off the shelves is beacuse kids should have a healthy and profanity free life. They should have a a good development turds learning. Books and other intertaiment should have no profanity because kids at a young age learn easly and if they take in the bad actions of others they will be bad themselfs. The reason why people should be aware of this problem is if you don't like profanity dont buy it. Also keep out of kids reach. The main reason why people swears is because of movies and songs it changes a person dramaticly. Talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life but not having a good job getting in jail raising up bad kids that learn from the parents mistakes.      In a @CAPS1 profanity is good for movies it gives it action and drama. profanity is words that are most times negative expressing anger and rudeness. We have a @CAPS2 full of profanity this is like a wide spred deases. Passing on from people to kids to their kids. I have expeariance this the hard way beacuse im chinese and i came to the united states back in @DATE1, i did not know any english. People would cuss at me all the time the could all be avoided if we didnt have any profanity in our daily usage of books, music, and movies. I have learned alot about people by the way they talk letting me know who to stay away from. We should keep profanity but limit it from kids. Profanity is like ice cream people wants it and other dont. People could make there choice of putting themselfs in a profanity free life. people can do what they think is the right thing to do. Taking it off the shelves for kids is what i think is the right thing to do but not adults.     Due to profanity people tend to put themselfs in truble. For example some people in the use gets pulled over by a officer for a low cost speeding ticket but then they would swear at the officer putting them selfs in more truble this could all be avoided if he didnt have ever said anything. Profanity could also make a good motivational speech i know this beacuse im on the @LOCATION1 football team. Before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it. So in the end what im saying is porfanity should say but keep it out of reach of kids for books parents dont buy them if you dont want your kids to see them. Movies read the lable on the back of the @CAPS3 and see the agae limit and for profanity. Lock up the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that have profanity in it so your kids have no acess to them. If you dont want any part of profanity you can make yourself to stayway from it. We all know the there is nothing you can do about others useing profanity just dont use it yourself and stay clean do what you think is right",4,3,4,2
4723,2,"When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc. that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well.     In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong.     Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive.     I myself would think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with.     After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem. In a sitaution like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior. Let this be a step in the right direction",4,4,4,2
4728,2,"I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people @MONTH1 find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things.      Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those  songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the @CAPS1 should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some @MONTH1 find them offensive but others greatly apreciate it.     Some people @MONTH1 be interested in these topics. Just like some people @MONTH1 be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be  fair for libraries to remove these materails from the library, and deny the people that do like them the rite to rent these materials.     Another factors is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading book or viewing movies that @MONTH1 be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else @MONTH1 find those materials offensive is no reasons to take them off the shelf.     I can see why some parents @MONTH1 be upset that their kids @MONTH1 see some of the things in the library that @MONTH1 not be apropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have a had a special area for kids materials. If the parents where woried about their kids seing some the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area.     I dont think that these materials that @MONTH1 seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be affended by something and it is not fare to deprive others of those materials even it is offensive to some.",4,4,4,2
4736,2,"books, music, movies, magazine, ect. shouldnt be taken off the shelves simply because they are offensive or because children can get their hands on them and repeat what they have read, seen, or herd. they should stay only because these so called 'offensive' objects that we have obtained can teach us very useful things such as what to do and what not to do and teaches us about our history or another countrys history. it is true there are some things in a library that children shouldnt see yet but whats to stop them from taking a look anyway? there are people who crave this offensive knowldge but are told time and time again they are not old or mature enough to handle such things but in more ways than one and it has been proven that some people thrive better with the true that holds violence than it being hidden from them. without these things children will never know what is really going on in the world around them and will be too shocked to do anything if they end up in the middle of something dangeroius and without the correct knowledg on how to handle it or where to go. that is exactly why the offensive things should stay in the library.",3,3,3,1
4740,2,"What @CAPS1 You Do?     A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive matterial to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the @ORGANIZATION1.     What is conciterd offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.      There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.     In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the libraries own resonsiblility to be a mother to all of it's cusomers. Let the libraries be!",4,4,4,2
4743,2,"Everyone has a preference in works of literature, such as books, magazines, movies or music. Different types of these works of literature are significant to each person. If everyone had the right to completely remove one piece of work that displeases them, then no works would remain. Therefore, I believe no materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places. Everyone has unique ideas, necesities and preferences.     A few years ago, I had a classmate who had different ideas from a myriad of people on religious persecution. He hated the idea of mixing people of different religions into one place. He wrote a paper containing all of his ideas on how the world should function in terms of religion. He tried to publish it, but did not succeed because his work was considered offensive. Even though I disagree with his ideas, I do not think his work should have been rejected. There could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been interested to read them. There could even have been ideas in his paper that could've helped countries solve various problems. I believe it is unfair that his paper was rejected.     People have different necesities based on what they have to accomplish. For example, I was reading a book last @DATE1 about a girl who was doing a project on racism. She went to the library to search for a book about apartheid in @LOCATION1 but couldn't find anything. She asked a librarian if there were any, but the librarian told her that books such as those were considered offensive in that local library and she would have to search elsewhere. I believe that it is unjust because the girl @MONTH1 not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project. She should've had the right to access the information that she needed for the project to prevent her from failing.     Another reason that no books should be removed is simply because everyone has unique preferences. In the world, there are books that certain people would enjoy more than others. Literature should be abled to be used for the purpose of entertainment and convenience. If I were to go to a library now, I would find many selections that correspond to my ideal novel or magazine. Every person should have that right. If people start removing materials that are offensive to them, then nothing on the shelves would remain and not one person would have the right to have access to the materials they desire.     In this world, diversity exists everywhere. People have and always will want, need and desire different things. Works of literature are just one of them. If people begin to eliminate offensive materials based on everyone's frustration or displeasures, then no books will remain on the public shelves. Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should never be removed from public places. These things are necessities to the world.",4,4,4,2
4745,2,"'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' @CAPS1 these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive.  First off, they should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them. Some @MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such. For example: rap music, all that is, is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and im sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense. So take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such that item can have a bad affect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different. Some books talk about religion, some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some @MONTH1 take offense to that. So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion,  in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or  religion. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive",3,3,3,1
4746,2,"Do you think libraries should have the right to take books and movies off the shelves if they find it offensive? In my opinon I do not agree and I think they should not be able to take them off the shelves. Many people have different thoughts and opinons and I am going to state mine in the next few paragraphs.      To begin with, not everybody likes to read or watch the same types of books or movies.Some like romantic,scary,myserious and there are many more selections.For instincts if one person reads something that they do not agree with, that does not mean the next person to read it is not going to like it either. Sometimes I enjoy reading books where people get hurt and sometimes killed but @CAPS1 someone else reads it,they might think that it is horrible and very offensive.    Another reason is, @CAPS1 I go to the library I expect to get the book that I want to read not what others like. One time I went to the library and I was looking for a romantic book to read and I could not find it. So I went up and asked the lady at the counter and she said they do not have it anymore,and I asked why and she told me a lady found it wrong for children to be reading. In my opinon, maybe that lady did not even like romantic books.They should not just off of what one person believes. The next reason is, the library put the movie or book on the shelf in the first place because they thought people would enjoy it. The writer or producer would not be very happy if he found out that his/her movie or book got taken out of the library because they found it offensive. Just give the book a chance and see how everybody likes it. I understand if everybody thought it was really offensive to take it off but not just one person.    To end with, my belief is that if they had the book in their library at one time it should just stay in there till it gets old and falls apart. The library is open to any and every type of books,not just boring ones.So I believe the books should not get taken off the sheleves they should just stay right were their suppose to be.If they do not like the book or movie then suggest to other peoples family not to read it or have them read it and see their reaction",4,4,4,2
4755,2,"Why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive? If they are inapropriate, why do we keep putting those books, magazines, movies, and the big one, music out there in the world? Let me tell you why, because people in @LOCATION1 unfortunatly, have grown out of @CAPS1-duty time, @PERSON1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and many other nonoffensive shows. But with the shows, books, and movies played today are very inapropriate to the younger viewers.      @DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons are over, at least the good cartoon like @CAPS4 and @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS5, ect, these cartoons, that I used to watch, that taught me how to be @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 have faded away. With the cartoons out now that are supposed to be good for children, all show @CAPS22 the same thing and that @CAPS22 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @CAPS11, and all the other @NUM1 deadly sins. They show these without explaning anything that can help the child in life, and that @CAPS22 @CAPS12.     We can @CAPS23 take books off the shelves, make directors' quit directing, rappers' quit rapping, or make the pornoghraphy stop but we can restrict it to a point. It will always be out there weather it @CAPS22 by the blackmarket or the adult stores.Thankfully there are ways around letting your children watch these shows. Restrictions on the television, make the offencive books, magazines in a library to a(n) restricted area to where no one can enter without being @NUM2 years old.     There @CAPS22 a lot to say about the music out there. It can be and @CAPS22 very offensive. I was born and raised on the old fasion country music and unfortunatly country music has gone to the dogs. Sorry to say but the change in music started at the begining of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS13, with the hippies. While they where all hopped up on @CAPS14, @CAPS15, and @CAPS16, they brought to life the new @CAPS17 and @CAPS18. So it has been here over @NUM3 years it @CAPS22 @CAPS23 going away. All we can do @CAPS22 hope our children does @CAPS23 turn on the radio that @CAPS22 tuned into that crap and say '@CAPS19 that sound like good music.'     With the pornoghraphic magazines, they have been around since @PERSON2 was in her prime. It @CAPS22 @CAPS23 going to stop whatever we do. All we can do @CAPS22 block it out of our lives. We can try and keep it out of our childrens eyes but it will @CAPS23 help they will always be known to this world.     I think we should move these things to another part of the library, that only adults can get to if that can be done in the library. Then we will move onto the music, and then the shows. Remember it will always be out there, all we can do as @CAPS20 @CAPS22 try to keep it out of reach of our children. We can't stop it but we can try and keep it out of there eyes. With the will power of @CAPS20 it CAN be done.FAILURE @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24 @CAPS25!!!",4,4,4,2
4756,2,"Libraries @CAPS1 Or @CAPS2?         This world is like no other world but to have some of our ideas blocked because there to offensive thats obsurd. There is a lot of things that are offensive in a library such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect... But if they are so offensive to some people then why keep complaining do somthing about tell it someone. Now librarys are a place where people can relax and grab a @CAPS1 book to read it. When they stumble upon this book that is highly offensve why put it back. Say somehthing and tell the manager this book is too offensive to be in a library.              There are kids in the library maybe looking for something to read they @MONTH1 stumble upon a movie that is very inpropriate. Things like that should not be in a public library. As a @CAPS3.S citizen i belive that things like that should be removed for the shevles. Why would they be up there in the first place what is this world coming to. Some of these books now and days need to be censored. Beacuse of all the @CAPS2 words in there kids might pick up all that foul language.           How about some of this music don't you think some of the lyrics maybe be offensive to some people. When rock stars, rapers, ect... write there lyrics they don't think of what other people think of them. They just might put the most badest languege in there songs they don't care they just want the money.Thats why you should put you're foot down and say this is going a little to far why not censor some of your lyrics? Why not write a letter sstating your concerns.           Things in the librarys like books, movies, magazines, ect.. all should be checked and blacked out. Some of this shoudn't even be displayed in the librarys. There are children in the library now why would you go as far to put things like that in a public library. Lets take a magazine for example, a magazine has things that talk a lot about sex, drugs, and other things related to that. Some people might like it but for a twelve year old boy to pick up somthing like that and  start reading it. To me thats wrong i dont know about anyone else but that shouldn't be displayed in a library.          Now ive been to a library before they have some inapropriate things in there. But i really didn't think anything of it but when i seen a eleven year old boy reading about drugs, sex, and violence that's something he might pick up on. He is seeing it in a book so why not try something in a book. Now and days this world has some shocking things in it but to put things like this in a library is horrible.           This is all where censership comes into play by editing a lot of the things in the library. People now and days dont care but they shoud start caring more. Thats just my opinion why i think its wrong to put all this @CAPS2 stuff in a public liberary. I think this is something kids don't need to see what do you think",4,4,4,2
4757,2,"I believe that if that book, music, or magazines  that is offensive and people don't like it then maybe they should remove themself from the librarie. tThere are alot of things out there that people like to read and listen too. mmaybe for those people who do not like it they can go to an other librarie. There are alot of them around us.      If a person did not like what they seen at that librarie then why go back? It could be offensive to some people but not all. So if people try to fight about removing them then the people that like them are going to be mad because they like to read it and they have a good time. Like i said before if they do not like it they then there are plenty more librarie's that probably will not have it there.     Libraries should be able to put what they want on their shelfs. They could put in it in the back and whoever wants it and go ask for it. Or they could go put something up and make it where you know whats over there and if you do not like then do go in. There is more then just one shelf in a librarie, i you don't like it then don't go over there. If there is a sign up then there will be one reason for you to go over there and get all offended and complan about it.      You got to think about other people in this too. Peolpe that do like it and go to the libraries to read books, listen ti music, rent a move, read magazines, they be able to do it anymore. Then they will be mad and then that just an other fight. Would anyone what that much drama, I wouldn't. That would be to much for me and hanle. People are  now these days. No one will know what i person would do if they don't get there book, music, movies, or magazines. How would you feel if you lost that? Probably not to happy.     I believe that that books, music, movies, and magazines should stay on the shelfs of the librarie. Just becuse a few people don't like it and want to fight for it, should really sitt back and look at what they are doing. There are more then just one librarie in this world. If you don't like the stuff that librarie is putting on it's shelfs then go find a new one. It's not worth fighting over and spenting all that money on that not alot of people have these days just to fight about what is on a librarie shelf. Not even worth it. Like i said before you don't like it. don't look at it, read it. listen to it, nothing. Just stay away from it and you will not get offended.",4,4,4,2
4759,2,"Today in the media there are many things that can be found offensive. Movies, books, songs and magizines are a few examples of where someone might find something offensive. I believe that whatever is put into the media has a purpose.      If someone thinks that something is offensive I think that they should just take what they find offensive away from themselves and not take it away from everyone else also. When a song artist comes up with a song there is a reason for why they put what they do in their songs. Sometimes they do it to get a point across to the audience.      When someone finds a movie offensive there is a reason for why it is the way it is; it's to get a point across. If people find the movie offensive they just simply shouldn't subject themselves to it. If they don't watch the movie they won't have anything to be offended about.      Certain books in libraries are found offensive to some people just because they don't agree with what is in them. If there is something in a book that you don't agree with you don't just take the book off the shelf and throw it away. Other people might injoy reading that book. If the book is thrown away no one will have the chance to read it besides the person who threw it away.     I do not believe that media that is found offensive to some of the public shouyld be removed. Not everyone finds certain things offinsive in the media. Again, everything that is put onto the market and into the media has a purpose; it's purpose is to get a point across to others.",3,4,3,1
4767,2,"This is going to be an essay about if people finding somthing offensive in a library or in music that it should be censored. It is also about if you think it should be taken off the shelves because some people find it offinsive.     The way I look or my own oppinion is that they should censore most things from libraries and music,but not get rid of it because one person finds it offensive. If you think about it thoses uncensered material like books that some people fnd offinsive might be a fit book for someone else to what they can relate to as they were growing up.     On the other hand they should be more carful about it so when younger kids listen to the radio or are reading a book they dont get the wrong ideas. We should censor things but only with an extent and not go over board with it. In the long run it might help with a more clean and safe population because were are censoring things to wear people dont hear bad and only hear the good in life. You never know you could make a big differance by doing that.      The reason i wouldnt go out and censor everthing is because you cant stop everone from doing it. You can always give it a try but thats one of the main reasons why i wouldnt try and get rid of it cause a sertan person might find it offensive. I ncan understand if you took it off there self that someone found offinse but only move it to wear no one will find it offensive.     Im not saying its wrong to do that but i think it could and probably would make alot of people angry. But hey what can i say what has the government done that we dont like or cant do anything about it. And thats all i have to say about that.",3,3,3,1
4770,2,"I personally think certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.; should not have to be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. First of all how do we define offensive? Is it something that discrimnates a certain group of people? Is it something that creates negative attention? Is it something we don't like? Anybody can walk in a library and find something they did not like, but that does not automatically mean it is offensive.      The national geographic magazine often has pictures of naked people and so does the @CAPS1 magazine. So which one would we have to put censorship on? The answer is we don't put one because this would start a big arguement of which is offensive and which is not.It would cause a conflict of two different sides. It is only offensive when we make it offensive. We do not have to look at something we don't like.We all have a choice and we can choose not to pick up something we might think is offensive.     The @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 not get along with the @CAPS2 but if both were in a library together with both of their holy books on the shelves, they cannot say one's book is offensive to another because it does not agree with theirs. We sometimes forget we have the ammendment that allows us to the freedom of speech and press. We @MONTH1 not like what one person publishes but it doesn't make their work offensive because it might be for a certain of group that likes it, which is not offensive to them.Everything in the library has a purpose and if it does not fit our purpose then there is no way it woud be offensive to us.     The library is a place for books, music, movies, magazines, etc..We come to the library to check out books for a research in order to learn. We also go to the library to read the newest book of a series. Putting a censorship on these things would not enable us to do these. We can't finish our research project because someone thought one book was offensive or we can't listen to new album @CAPS3.Dre released because some people think the lyrics are too offensive. Putting a censorship would upset the general public more than not having a censorship because if everyone can check out what they want from the library then everyone is content",5,3,5,3
4774,2,"I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive. I think this because people have different views and belifts on certains types of things, with reglion, culture, and sexaually. Some people can be defend by it but other might can be inform and learn new facts that they didn't already know.      People are not going to look at things the same. Eveyone has their own way of life and think differently. If one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves. One by one people would find other materials offenive and what does it leave us. No more books, music, movies, and magazines.     Let face it everyone have different belifts, values, and purpose but taking a materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridulous to me. I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again. Feel offensive over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again. Easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we is @CAPS1 are. American is about being free and have rhe right to speak our mind. So putting materials off of shelves is not the answer",3,3,3,1
4775,2,"Yes we should keep the books,music,movies,an magazines.     The magazines an music might not be a good thing for some us for must people use music to consutrate on doing work an magazines help us on getting topics for class work. why would some one take books or any thing that help us in life, so the person who wants to take book away should live the books or anything eles alone. So to this yes we should keep the books,music,movies, an magazines on the shelfs. We need to start fighting for what we want an how we want it should not be know ones eles chioc to deside what is good for us.",2,2,2,0
