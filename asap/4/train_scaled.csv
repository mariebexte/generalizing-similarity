Saeng, throughout the story was comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of home. The plant during the winter metaphorically explains: @CAPS1 attitude towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus plant in the winter is not as beautiful in the bitter cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Saeng is bitter about her new country and driving test, but is adapting, and will be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again.

The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her ""budding"" will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test.

For example, in the story it says """"When the snows melt and then geese return"" the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says ""Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance"". This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote """"when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again"", because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started.""",3,3,3,1.0

Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus.

For example,  in lines @NUM1 Saeng's thought's are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saeng's eyes now and swept over her and"" in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept."" This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because it's gone.
