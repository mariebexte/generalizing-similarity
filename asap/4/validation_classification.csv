8870,4,I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing.

She speaks of the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant three subjects found in the story. when she says ""when the snow melts and the geese return"", she is referring to the geese mentioned when she says ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky"".

8950,4,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has everything together. One way it ties everything together is by taking what had happen in the beginning and tieing it in with why she had bought the flower in the first place. Also it ties Saeng's old memories from Vietnam to her new way of life in the United States. The story states ""carefully Saeng dicked it up and smilled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar programe filled her lungs."" this is now the flower she found in the flower shop gave her memories from Vietnam. this is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.",1,1,1,1

This quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive.

9012,4,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is talking about when Saeng vowed silently because she is thinking about what had happen a long time ago with her mom, the plants in her garden.

9035,4,"The geese flying south for the winter and the hibiscus budding are normal things to Saeng. The author wanted to conclude the story with this to show that Saeng felt comfort in things that she was acustomed to. Saeng wanted to have the geese and hibiscus there to feel more comfortable while taking her driving test. Saeng still longs for home and does not quite feel like she fits in the u.s. The hibiscus gives her that comfort feeling like she is home again, in Vietnam, Saeng still feels homesick because she wants things to be how they were. The plants in the green house along with the disappointment of failing her driving test bring her to the emotional state that she was in. In the second to last paragraph the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng has when seeing the v formation. Saeng feels that in the winter she will not have the same comfort feeling as when she can see the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead. It says when Saeng arrived in the @LOCATION2 she had nothing that was familiar to her.  Now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants. The author concluding by saying Saeng will take her driving test when the winter ends is a good closing because it gives you some insight as to what Saeng is going to do.",3,2,3,3
9046,4,"The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think he's trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant.

This quote from the story shows that things are starting to be right and she is starting to feel comforting her by making her relize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus it brings back memorys of the flowers that   they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home.

Next she is comparing the hibiscus to her passing and sulding on the test. That is way the author concludes the story with this paragraph.,1,1,1,1

10338,4,"The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. ""She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become... almost familiar now"" that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.",3,2,3,3
10398,4,"I think the author concludes the story with the phase when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" I there saying that they will be ready for them the next time they come back.""",0,0,0,0
10407,4,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again to emphasize that you can overcome a defeat or failure by waiting until the ""season"" come again for you to re-endure. Basically, the hibiscus(a plant) meant much to the narrator and her mother which was dying and they dug up a hole to help it to grow, so when it grows again that proves that it will be living better. So when Saeng relates the test that will be her her having the opportunity to past the test. The story with this paragraph symbolizing a new beginning about to take place. This actually means a situation that will came again that will help you to get what is needed out of it that you missed. The story and the paragraph emphasizes what life is about to budling a cycle.",3,2,3,3
10486,4,I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was leading to it and the story  would have been pointless if it wasnt conclusion.,0,0,0,0
10520,4,"The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn't have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story.",2,2,2,2
10543,4,There are two reasons why he had conclude the story with this pararagraph. The one reason why the author had conclude the story with the paragraph because Saeng had silently had picked up a Winter Hibiscus so she can have to passed that driving Test. Finally; the last reason why the author had conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to try her driving Test again so she can passed so she can also drive when she gets down passing it. These two reasons were so confusing to figure out what the author conclude in the story with that sentence.,1,1,1,1
10555,4,"The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng.",2,2,2,2
10600,4,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to explain to the reader that she isn't done gardening, that she'll  go back when it blooms once again. also she isn't done. she'd rather garden than go to school.

10614,4,"The story of Winter Hibiscus"" is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleinates some home-sickness. Saeng's promise indicates that she is comng to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons. ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - Almost familiar to her now."" I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allows to change.""",3,3,3,3
10639,4,The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomforalable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop. This shows that even though things can remind her of home it isn't the same. You have to get used to and become accostumed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test.,2,2,2,2
