13530,5,"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finaly, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..."" This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremly close they were to everyone the knew.

The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country.

13627,5,"The mood of this memoir is nonfiction. The mood is that because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about his past in his and it is about the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a Cuban, Italian, and a Spanish neighborhood. The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good). The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a nice apartment building. The mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring, I know this because the ""home"" is so pleasent to be inside.",2,1,2,0.5
