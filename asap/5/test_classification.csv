Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age"" There is so much passion in this phrase.

My third example in the story is when the author states in paragraph @NUM3, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

In the excerpt ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 Narciso is forever grateful to his parents.

Also, how his parents accepted how they wouldn't get the jobs they deserved. However, Narciso's parents knew that if their children got better lives it was worth it, which made Narciso feel incredibly grateful for his parent's sacrifice. He appreciated how his parents taught him the true meaning of ""family."" In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love.""

First, the author states in his memoir, ""I was born into this simple house... which I adore to this day... childhood... first friend."" All these phrases show Narciso reflecting to his childhood, his first friend, and first house. Narciso reflects to his past, like how all memoirs should be. Secondly, the author uses words like ""great sense... adore... grateful,"" to show his appreciation and happiness of his childhood. To my knowledge, there aren't any grave, dark, sad parts of his life in the memoir. Finally, the author says that he is grateful for his rich culinary skills, passed down by his family, and his parents' love and sacrifice. This gives the mood of the memoir appreciation throughout the memoir, especially near the end, where he is grateful for his parents' selflessness. To conclude, the mood of this memoir is appreciation, happiness, and reflective.",3,3,3,3

Its about love and family and spending time together.,2,2,2,2
13350,5,"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very subtle and can be undefind. I say this because when I read this I didn't feel anything @CAPS1 I thought about it. The article gave off a very comfortting mood. As he said in the memoir ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" at nothing to do being blood relative."" (@CAPS2 in the beginning paragraph @NUM1) That quote sets a mood where a little audience in your head goes ""@CAPS3 I never thought of that way before."" This memoir does not give out blunt moobs like happy or sad, It makes you think. There was never a really sad moment in the whole thing. At the end of paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote is another example of giving a very undefind mood, I say it is undefind because you just cant put it into words of how you feel. So in conclusion the mood this piece gives is undefind.",1,1,1,1

In paragraph @NUM1, there is a great catalogue of gratefulness to the social skills that were passed down to him. When in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about their cuban feast, a small one perhaps but with true love + life. You get a true sense of the gratefulness Rodriguez displays for his parents not because of who they are or how much money they have or what they give him (materialistically), but being genuinely grateful of the nature + kindness bestowed to him.",2,3,3,3
